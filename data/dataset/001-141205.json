By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed ORG and third party \u2019s appeals on points of law on the basis of the evidence available to it , quashed the judgments of the lower courts , convicted the applicant of attempted fraud and forgery and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal ( contesta\u0163ie \u00een anulare ) against the final judgment of DATE . He argued , inter alia , that the final - instance court had breached the applicable rules of criminal procedure and LAW because it had convicted him without hearing evidence from him after he had been acquitted by the lower courts .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s extraordinary appeal . It held that after the applicant had been acquitted by the lower courts , ORG sitting as court of final appeal had had a duty to hear evidence from him in accordance with the applicable rules of criminal procedure . However , although the applicant had been summoned at the correspondence address he had chosen himself , he had failed to attend the hearings . Also , he had not indicated , either through his chosen legal representative or by way of written submissions , his wish for the court to hear evidence from him directly or the objective reasons preventing him from attending the hearings . The final - instance court had summoned the applicant in exactly the same way the lower courts had done . Furthermore , during the proceedings before the first - instance court the summoning of the applicant through the procedure he was contesting had not prevented him from appearing before the court , from being heard by it or from submitting arguments in his defence , either directly or through the same chosen legal representative who had represented him during the entire course of the proceedings . At no stage of the proceedings had the applicant or his legal representative asked the court to summon him at a different address . Consequently , it could not be held that the final - instance court had lacked diligence in determining if the applicant was living at the address indicated by him . The court had assumed that as long as the applicant had been lawfully summoned , he had been familiar with the proceedings and had opted not to appear before the court . In fact , his conduct had been similar to the conduct he had displayed before the second - instance court , in that he had failed to attend the hearings despite having been lawfully summoned to do so , and had chosen to be defended exclusively through his chosen legal representative . It further dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that he had not been familiar with the proceedings because he had not been in contact with his chosen legal representative , on the grounds that they had signed separate legal representation contracts for each stage of the proceedings , and that on DATE the applicant \u2019s legal representative had informed the court about his whereabouts and had pledged to ensure his client \u2019s attendance before it .", "CARDINAL . Articles DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL and DATE provide that it is mandatory for the finalinstance court to hear direct evidence from an accused when the lower courts have acquitted him or her . Where an appellate court quashes a judgment delivered by a lower court , it has to decide on the evidence to be adduced and set a date on which to take statements from the accused directly if the latter has not been heard or if he or she has been acquitted by the lower court .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL provide that if a summoned person fails to appear before the court , and her attendance or direct evidence is required , he or she can be taken before the court on the basis of an order to appear ( mandat de aducere ) . The order to appear is enforceable by the national police , the gendarmes or the local police . If the person responsible for enforcing the order to appear is unable to find the intended recipient of the order at the address indicated , he or she must open an investigation . If the investigation remains fruitless , he or she must draft a report outlining the investigative steps that have been carried out .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( d ) provides that the court examining the appeal on points of law can allow the appeal on points of law and re - examine the case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
