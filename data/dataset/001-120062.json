( ... ) It is true that in the course of the [ separate ] trial in a case before ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL PERSON attempted to change his statements and argued that PERSON had nothing to do with drugs ; however , it was difficult to consider these statements convincing in the light of the earlier coherent and detailed depositions . \u201d", "\u201c The assessment of the credibility of those testimonies is certainly not affected by the fact that GPE and PERSON could not have been heard directly before the court .
