PORTUGAL AND THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Ms PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE with PERSON . They were assisted by PERSON and PERSON , counsel .", "The applicant is a football supporter who was arrested and charged with participating in a riot during the European Football Championships in GPE in DATE . He was tried on DATE by ORG , DATE after his arrest . The applicant claims that he had TIME with his legal representative before the hearing ; that he did not understand the nature of the charge against him ; that there were just CARDINAL interpreters for CARDINAL defendants ; and that the case proceeded by way of dock identification by the NORP police .", "The applicant was convicted and sentenced to DATE in prison . However , the sentence was not enforceable for DATE or until any appeal was heard . The offence was also one for which bail had to be granted pending appeal . Pursuant to a temporary organic law ( no . QUANTITY ) , which had been put in place to deal with trouble during the football championships , the applicant was permitted to leave the country under an order for voluntary departure .", "The applicant wished to appeal against his conviction and sentence and he and his lawyer intimated this intention to ORG . The appeal was not admitted due to a failure to submit proper grounds for appeal . In consequence , the applicant \u2019s sentence became final . The applicant maintains , however , that proper grounds were submitted . No immediate action was taken to enforce the custodial sentence .", "In DATE , the GPE authorities sought to impose football banning orders ( civil restraining orders that prevent individuals from attending football matches in GPE or from travelling abroad to watch international football matches ) on those , including the applicant , who had been convicted of involvement in riots at the European Championships in GPE . However , on DATE , following a hearing that lasted DATE , a district judge refused to grant the banning orders , holding that the convictions were \u201c obtained in circumstances that were so unfair as to be incompatible with the applicants\u2019 right to a fair trial under LAW [ of the LAW ] \u201d . In reaching this finding , the district judge relied heavily on the oral evidence of an NORP police officer , PC PERSON , who had attended the trial in GPE as an observer .", "In DATE , the NORP authorities made a request to ORG that the applicant should serve his outstanding sentence in a GPE prison . This request was refused as the GPE authorities would only consider executing a foreign sentence within the scope of the CARDINAL Convention on ORG , which would have required the applicant to have been serving a sentence in GPE at the time of the request .", "On DATE , the NORP authorities issued NORP Arrest Warrant , requesting the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE , which was certified by ORG ( \u201c SOCA \u201d ) on DATE . The applicant was arrested on DATE , brought before City of ORG and granted conditional bail . An extradition hearing took place in DATE before the Senior District Judge . The applicant \u2019s representatives did not call any live witnesses , instead relying on the findings of the judge at the banning order hearing . In his decision , handed down on DATE , the Senior District Judge granted the extradition order . He held that , although the earlier judge \u2019s findings were persuasive , they were not binding on him . Having examined a written note of the trial , the Senior District Judge concluded that the proceedings in GPE had not been unfair within the meaning of LAW . He noted that the applicant had been represented by an experienced lawyer who was representing just CARDINAL other client and that an interpreter had been present throughout the trial . The applicant \u2019s lawyer was able to cross - examine witnesses and address the court , and the applicant was able to give oral evidence . The Senior District Judge also noted that the applicant could have requested postponement of the trial for DATE , which he had not done .", "The applicant sought to appeal the Senior District Judge \u2019s decision to ORG . However , the applicant \u2019s representatives at the time failed to file and serve notice of appeal to ORG within the statutory period of DATE and , on DATE , ORG held that it had no jurisdiction . Thereafter , the applicant instructed new solicitors who applied for the extradition hearing to be re - opened . On DATE the Senior District Judge found that he had no jurisdiction to do so . The applicant sought judicial review of that decision and , at the same time , issued judicial review proceedings against SOCA in respect of its decision to enforce the extradition order .", "These judicial review applications were heard together in ORG on DATE and dismissed in a written judgment handed down on DATE . ORG held that , although the applicant had suffered an apparent injustice , it had no power to act . The injustice did not stem from the unfairness of the hearing ( which was disputed ) , but from the successive failures of the applicant \u2019s lawyers . Nonetheless , it went on to indicate a hope that this ORG would grant an interim measure under LAW .", "On DATE the applicant commenced further judicial review proceedings , alleging that it would be unlawful to extradite him while the present application was pending before this ORG against GPE . On CARDINAL DATE , ORG granted an interim injunction against extradition pending the hearing of the judicial review application .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s representatives at the time lodged an application with this ORG against GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) . The applicant alleged that the NORP trial had been unfair on CARDINAL grounds : the applicant had had insufficient time adequately to instruct a lawyer and prepare his defence ; the trial had taken place so quickly that he had been unable to retrieve ORG footage , which would have given him an alibi ; he had no time to trace witnesses who would have supported that alibi ; the quality of the interpretation at the trial was so poor he did not understand the nature of the charge and could not follow the proceedings ; and the temporary organic law did not provide adequate protection for the rights of the defence .", "On DATE , a Committee of CARDINAL Judges declared the application inadmissible . It found that the final domestic decision within the meaning of LAW had been given on DATE , DATE before the date on which the application had been submitted to the ORG .", "The present application was lodged against GPE on DATE . On DATE the applicant wrote to the ORG , bringing an application against GPE and requesting an interim measure under LAW to prevent his extradition by GPE authorities to GPE . He further requested first , that the ORG indicate to ORG that they should not request his surrender until his substantive application to the ORG had been heard and second , that the ORG indicate to ORG that they should withdraw ORG or issue a fresh warrant thereby allowing proceedings in GPE to recommence .", "On DATE , the Fourth Section of the Court ( to which the application had been allocated ) decided that , in light of the interim injunction given by ORG on DATE , there was no current risk that the applicant would be extradited from GPE and it was inappropriate to determine the Rule CARDINAL requests at that stage .", "On DATE the High Court gave judgment on the application for judicial review that had been lodged on DATE . It lifted the injunction which it had given on DATE . ORG found that it had no power to prevent an extradition merely because an application had been made to ORG .", "On DATE the Acting President of the Section decided to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG and to indicate to ORG that the applicant should not be extradited to GPE . That decision was taken to allow the Section to consider the applicant \u2019s Rule CARDINAL requests . On DATE , the Section decided to lift the interim measure previously indicated to ORG . It also decided to refuse the Rule CARDINAL requests made in respect of ORG .", "On DATE the applicant commenced further judicial review proceedings in GPE . He argued that his extradition would be incompatible with LAW , relying on email correspondence from NORP consular staff in DATE , which recorded their understanding that , because the applicant \u2019s sentence was DATE , his deportation meant he would not have to serve his sentence in GPE . The judicial review application was refused on DATE . ORG found that there was nothing in the emails which had not been before the Senior District Judge . It also found that it could not intervene to prevent extradition pending the outcome of an application to this ORG when the applicant would not suffer irreversible harm as a result of the extradition and when this ORG had already refused the applicant \u2019s Rule CARDINAL request .", "The applicant was extradited to GPE on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
