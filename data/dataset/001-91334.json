SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ms I. Kalmerborn , ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Following a tax audit of the applicant \u2019s taxi firm , ORG ( skattemyndigheten ) of GPE considered that revenues from the firm had not been accounted for in the applicant \u2019s tax returns for DATE , i.e. DATE . Accordingly , by decisions of CARDINAL DATE , ORG revised upwards his taxable income by MONEY ( SEK ) and increased his liability to employer \u2019s contributions by SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . By a further decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG increased his liability to value - added tax ( merv\u00e4rdesskatt ) by SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . Moreover , as the information supplied by the applicant in his tax returns was found to be incorrect and the turnover of the applicant \u2019s business had been revised upwards under a discretionary assessment procedure , ORG ordered him to pay tax surcharges ( skattetill\u00e4gg , avgiftstill\u00e4gg ) amounting to PERCENT of the increased tax liability , depending on the type of tax involved . As a result of the decisions , tax surcharges of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) were levied on the applicant . Of this amount , SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL related to income tax , SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL to employer \u2019s contributions and SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL to value - added tax . It appears that the amounts were payable in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for a stay of execution with regard to the employer \u2019s contributions and related surcharges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE against ORG taxation decisions . While , at that time , the formal decision on value - added tax had not yet been taken , the appeal letter referred to all the tax issues reviewed by ORG , i.e. income tax , employer \u2019s contributions and value - added tax . He also requested that the execution of payment of the amounts assessed be stayed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he complained to ORG that the time until the taxes became due was too short . By letters of CARDINAL and DATE , ORG called on the applicant to pay the disputed amounts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reconsidered its decision on a stay of execution with regard to the employer \u2019s contributions but decided not to change it . ORG did not find that the outcome of the tax case was uncertain or that payment of the amount in question would result in considerable damage for the applicant or would otherwise appear unjust , and thus concluded that the prerequisites laid down in DATE , subsection CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) or ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Uppb\u00f6rdslagen , DATE ) had not been fulfilled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , and upon review , on DATE , ORG also refused a stay of execution with regard to the income tax and related surcharges assessed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against ORG decisions to refuse stays of execution . By judgments of DATE , ORG rejected the appeals . It noted that the disputed amounts of income tax , employer \u2019s contributions and corresponding surcharges and late - payment fees had already been paid , inter alia through execution levied by ORG ( kronofogdemyndigheten ) on DATE . As a consequence , the amounts could only be refunded in the event of the applicant being successful in the main tax cases , and there was therefore no reason to grant a stay .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE . On DATE ORG stated to the appellate court that all tax amounts had been paid and that there was therefore no ground on which to grant a stay . In a letter to the applicant of DATE , ORG stated , however , that late - payment fees of CARDINAL remained due and that the applicant had been granted a stay of execution with regard to this amount .", "CARDINAL . According to a case note in the appellate court \u2019s file , ORG had stated , on DATE , that no taxes and fees were due following the levying of execution of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL on DATE and the payment by the applicant of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , subscribing to the reasons given by ORG , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Regerings - r\u00e4tten ) refused leave to appeal concerning the stay - of - execution issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reported the applicant to ORG ( region\u00e5klagarmyndigheten ) in GPE , claiming that proceeds in the amount of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL had not been accounted for in the applicant \u2019s bookkeeping .", "CARDINAL . While accepting the applicant \u2019s objections concerning certain amounts , the public prosecutor , on DATE , indicted him for a suspected bookkeeping offence relating to undeclared proceeds of SEK CARDINAL as well as undeclared salaries paid to various taxi drivers .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON found the applicant guilty of having intentionally failed to enter proceeds of MONEY as well as substantial salary payments in the books . This constituted a bookkeeping offence under LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG ) . He was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) upheld ORG judgment . On DATE ORG ( H\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant had been convicted of a bookkeeping offence , ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) of GPE , reviewed his eligibility for a traffic licence ( trafiktillst\u00e5nd ) . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , it decided that an admonition was sufficient , having regard to the time that had passed since the offence had been committed . It appears that the applicant did not appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . As mentioned above , on DATE the applicant appealed against ORG decisions on taxes and tax surcharges . On DATE the ORG reconsidered its decision relating to income tax but did not change it .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld ORG decision on income tax . The court considered that the documentation on which the impugned decision was based was reliable . In this connection , it had regard to previous judgments by ORG and ORG where the computerised control material from GPE , an association to which the applicant was affiliated , had been examined and found reliable . It took into account other evidence as well in finding that the applicant had failed to account for revenues from the taxi business in his tax returns . In regard to the applicant \u2019s objection that the public prosecutor , in the criminal proceedings , had only indicted him for undeclared proceeds of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL whereas the basis for ORG taxation decision was that there were undeclared proceeds of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL , the court noted that , whereas a criminal conviction required proof beyond reasonable doubt , the standard of proof was lower in tax proceedings . In upholding the tax surcharge , the court had regard to LAW and the case - law of ORG and found that a criminal conviction did not prevent the imposition of a surcharge . Moreover , no grounds for remission of the surcharge were at hand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG why his appeals concerning employer \u2019s contributions and value - added tax had not been examined . DATE the court informed the applicant that no cases concerning these issues had been registered with the court , that ORG had stated , on DATE , that it did not have any such cases either and that the court , on DATE , had sent a copy of the applicant \u2019s appeal letter to ORG for possible action .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against ORG judgment to ORG , requesting that his income tax liability be fixed in accordance with his tax returns and that the tax surcharge be set aside . He claimed that , as a surcharge was involved , in order for the hearing to be fair under LAW , the standard of proof of criminal proceedings had to be applied . Moreover , the surcharge should be set aside on account of the unreasonable length of the proceedings in the case and the prohibition on double jeopardy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment , subscribing to the reasons given by the latter court in regard to the income tax . With respect to the tax surcharge , the appellate court referred to case - law of ORG concerning the possibility of remission due to lengthy proceedings and the prohibition on double jeopardy . It concluded that there had not been any irregularities in the handling of the case which could involve a violation of the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . As the surcharge could not be remitted on this basis or on any other ground , the applicant \u2019s complaints in this respect were rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal in the income tax case .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , the applicant asked ORG what had happened to his appeals against the decisions on employer \u2019s contributions and value - added tax . On DATE ORG made reconsideration decisions , in which it set aside the associated tax surcharges , but upheld the amounts of employer \u2019s contributions and value - added tax as such . On DATE , as a consequence of the reconsideration decisions , ORG adopted new taxation decisions , in which it stated that the surcharges relating to employer \u2019s contributions and value - added tax had been quashed due to the excessive length of the proceedings and mistakes made in the handling of the applicant \u2019s appeals . In DATE ORG repaid to the applicant the quashed tax surcharges with interest .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG in regard to the amounts of employer \u2019s contributions and value - added tax . By a judgment of DATE , the court upheld ORG decisions . Following an appeal to ORG , no further information has been provided as to the progress of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested compensation from the Chancellor of Justice ( NORP ) . He referred to the issues on which the ORG , in the present case , had invited the ORG to submit observations , namely the enforcement of ORG decisions before a court determination , the length of the proceedings , the presumption of innocence , and ORG original failure to examine the appeals concerning employer \u2019s contributions and value - added tax .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , the Chancellor of ORG informed the applicant that , given the still unsettled ORG practice as to when compensation could be given for possible violations of the Conventions , it was unlikely that the Chancellor would exercise the authority to settle compensation claims on behalf of the ORG out of court . Instead , the applicant was advised to initiate court proceedings in the matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted compensation proceedings against the ORG before ORG . He claimed ORG CARDINAL in non - pecuniary damages , CARDINAL for lack of effective access to court and CARDINAL for excessive length of proceedings . He also claimed SEK CARDINAL in pecuniary damages for what he perceived as the difference between a correct tax amount and the amount that had actually been fixed by ORG and SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL in legal costs . Finally , he requested interest on the amounts as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . In reply , the ORG acknowledged that the length of the proceedings had violated the ORG and submitted that compensation in the amount of ORG plus interest would be reasonable in this respect . The ORG , however , disputed the applicant \u2019s other claims .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG found that the time that had passed between the applicant \u2019s appeals in DATE and ORG latest reconsideration decisions in DATE had been excessive and in breach of LAW . It further considered that the applicant had not had effective access to court under that provision , as the examination of his request for a stay of execution had been precluded by the immediate enforcement of the taxes and surcharges . However , noting that the complaint relating to the allegedly excessive tax amount concerned the substance of the tax case which had already been examined by the courts on the basis of the evidence presented , ORG found no violation of the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW in this respect .", "CARDINAL . ORG awarded the applicant compensation for the CARDINAL Convention violations found with an overall amount of EUR CARDINAL . As to legal costs , it refused compensation for costs relating to the proceedings before ORG . In regard to the remaining amount of ORG , accrued in the compensation proceedings , ORG took into account that the applicant had been unsuccessful with CARDINAL of his claims and decided to grant him CARDINAL of that amount , or SEK CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , reiterating the claims made before ORG . The ORG contested the appeal and requested that the judgment of ORG be upheld . The case is at present pending before the appellate court ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
