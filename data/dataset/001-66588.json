He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant arrived in GPE ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) with a short - term visitor \u2019s visa issued by ORG in GPE . He did not claim asylum and was given leave to enter for DATE , stating that he was looking at colleges with a view to studying LANGUAGE .", "In DATE he was charged and convicted of theft and sentenced to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment . In DATE he was convicted of dishonest handling . Since he did not pay the fine , in DATE he was again arrested and committed to prison until DATE .", "In DATE the applicant began a relationship with Ms R , a NORP citizen . She had a baby in DATE .", "In DATE a deportation order was served at the applicant \u2019s last - known address . He had made no application to extend his leave to remain and was liable to deportation for overstaying . A further deportation order was signed in DATE and served on the applicant in DATE , when he was arrested . Ms R was now pregnant with their second child .", "On DATE ORG for ORG made detailed submissions to ORG on the applicant \u2019s behalf , requesting that he be granted leave to remain on the basis of his relationship with PERSON", "The applicant was interviewed by an immigration official on DATE . He claimed that his older brother had been executed and that he had been arrested in consequence and had fled to the GPE in fear of further ill - persecution . He appeared , however , unsure whether his brother had been a student or what he had studied . He claimed that his younger brother had avoided military service by jumping from a building and injuring himself . He also stated that he had no political affiliations at all in GPE and that , far from disagreeing with the regime in GPE , he had no quarrel with the PERSON regime . ORG official found the applicant \u2019s account of his relationship with Ms R to be \u201c fraught with discrepancies \u201d .", "In the course of a further interview on DATE the applicant alleged that , while the PERSON regime had confiscated some of his father \u2019s property and the applicant disliked it , he had never been involved in politics in GPE , belonged to any anti - government group or taken part in any demonstration . He again referred to his younger brother \u2019s avoidance of military service , his older brother \u2019s execution for anti - government activities , his own subsequent arrest and ill - treatment , and his release and flight from GPE . He had lied on entry to the GPE , saying he was married , whereas he had divorced in DATE . He confirmed at the end of the interview that he had never received threats from the NORP authorities . The report of the interview states that the applicant could offer no convincing reason why , if fear was the reason he left GPE , he had not applied for asylum in the GPE earlier . However , the applicant added that his long absence from the country and avoidance of military service would increase the risk of his having a \u201c bad time \u201d if returned .", "Ms R was also interviewed in DATE .", "On DATE the deportation order was revoked . ORG indicated in its letter of that date that the applicant \u201c did not appear to be more exposed to risk than any other NORP national as he appears to lack either the motivation or capacity to represent opposition to the regime . \u201d However , given his long standing relationship with Ms R , he was given exceptional leave to remain until DATE , when his position would be reconsidered . On DATE Ms R had their second child . Both children were placed for adoption on DATE . On DATE the applicant and PERSON married . No further request for an extension of leave to remain was received at ORG , although the applicant claims that Ms R had said that she would post his request .", "In DATE a full adoption order was granted in respect of the CARDINAL children .", "In DATE the police attempted to find the applicant . In DATE police enquiries revealed that Ms R and he were separated . In DATE the applicant was arrested on grounds of overstaying . In DATE he was convicted of overstaying and fined . ORG upheld his conviction but the applicant was not recommended for deportation .", "In DATE his solicitors made a late application for indefinite leave to remain on the basis of his marriage . While he and his wife were requested to attend on DATE for interview with immigration officials , the applicant attended ( with representation ) but Ms R did not attend . The applicant explained that they were living separately and that Ms R had serious alcohol problems but that he was hopeful of a reconciliation .", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG refused the application , as there was no evidence that the marriage subsisted , and issued a deportation order . The applicant had overstayed and had not made any application for an extension . He had been in GPE for DATE , most of the time without any legal authority . His alleged fears of returning to GPE had already been examined and dismissed and there were no compassionate reasons militating against deportation .", "The applicant appealed against this decision , arguing that he merited asylum . He was interviewed by an immigration officer on CARDINAL DATE and made general submissions which were largely the same as those made on CARDINAL DATE . He confirmed that he had never been politically active , but stated that a magazine published in DATE in LOC had indicated that he was wanted by the NORP authorities . He implied that his younger brother \u2019s injuries were not self - inflicted ( as previously maintained ) but had been inflicted by the NORP authorities . He still hoped to reconcile with his wife , although they were not in regular contact .", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG rejected the appeal : it was considered that the applicant had not demonstrated a well - founded fear of persecution and that there were no compassionate grounds warranting the grant of leave to remain .", "The applicant appealed to the Special Adjudicator ( \u201c SA \u201d ) . He gave evidence about his older brother \u2019s execution , the loss of his father \u2019s wealth to PERSON , and his own departure from GPE in fear . He said that he had not contacted ORG when he arrived as he had not known about political asylum . He also referred to the magazine where his name allegedly appeared as someone wanted by the PERSON regime . Although the hearing was adjourned for DATE to allow the magazine to be produced , the applicant could not produce it .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed his appeal . He found that the DATE deportation order had not been revoked because of the grant of asylum ( as the applicant had claimed ) but instead because of the applicant \u2019s relationship with PERSON He considered the various different versions of events presented by the applicant over DATE and found him generally to be lacking in credibility . Moreover , apart from his unproven and tenuous connection with his brother \u2019s political activities , the NORP authorities would have no reason to target the applicant . It could not be accepted that all NORP outside GPE would be pursued by the regime on their return . No compassionate circumstances appeared to exist .", "On DATE leave to appeal to ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) was granted . The applicant has not submitted the ORG decision , although later correspondence from the Secretary of ORG indicates that the ORG refused his appeal on DATE . However , the Secretary of ORG re - considered following further representations on the applicant \u2019s behalf , and on DATE exercised his discretion to grant indefinite leave to remain on the basis of the applicant \u2019s marriage .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted of rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm on an elderly neighbour . In finding that there were grave and aggravating features to the case , the trial judge sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . No deportation order was made . His sentence was reduced to DATE on appeal .", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG , finding that the applicant \u2019s continued presence in the GPE was not conducive to the public good , decided to deport him and to issue removal directions .", "The applicant appealed against the deportation order to the ORG on the basis of his good character ( he stated that \u201c since my arrival I have been of good character and adhered to the laws of the land \u201d ) , his responsibility to his children , his professional affairs in the GPE , the previous grant of leave to remain and his pending appeal against sentence . He challenged the removal directions on the basis that he had a fear of persecution : he had fled from GPE as he had been politically involved , he had been allowed to enter the GPE to seek asylum , he was still campaigning for asylum , he was still regarded as a subversive in GPE and his time in LOC would be badly regarded .", "On DATE his appeal to the ORG was rejected . He was found to be \u201c totally lacking in credibility \u201d and it was not believed that he had \u201c the slightest interest in politics in GPE or here \u201d . It was found that the CARDINAL brothers with whom the applicant remained in contact worked for ORG and that his older brother had been executed for fraud rather than any political activity . It was further noted that the applicant had a large family in GPE and that he had been convicted of a horrific offence in the GPE for which he had not shown the slightest remorse . It was true that the NORP regime was unpredictable and that any NORP having spent TIME in LOC was likely to come under some scrutiny . However , on balance , deportation was the right course .", "A deportation order was made on DATE . At the expiry of the applicant \u2019s prison sentence , fresh removal directions were set by the Secretary of ORG . The applicant \u2019s representatives appealed , invoking Articles CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG rejected the application . He considered the applicant \u2019s record in the GPE to have been \u201c quite appalling , showing complete contempt for both immigration and criminal law \u201d . The applicant had formed remarkably few ties with the GPE and his claim to asylum had been considered and rejected on a number of occasions by the Secretary of ORG , the ORG and the ORG . There were no substantial grounds to believe that the applicant would be ill - treated contrary to LAW . On DATE the Secretary of ORG confirmed his decision to deport . The applicant appealed to the ORG on DATE .", "Following a hearing on DATE , by a decision dated CARDINAL DATE , the ORG rejected the appeal . The applicant \u2019s credibility had previously been found lacking , a finding confirmed by his answers to questions before the ORG . In particular , the ORG found it significant that the applicant relied before him on the suggestion that , if returned to GPE , he would tell the NORP authorities that he had left because he was an opponent of the regime - the SA observed that \u201c this suggestion beggars belief in view of the previous evidence \u201d . There was no evidence to suggest that the NORP authorities were aware or would become aware of the applicant \u2019s criminal record or that he would be at risk of double jeopardy , other sanctions or treatment in breach of LAW . There was no evidence that he would be prejudiced if the authorities discovered that he was a failed asylum seeker and there was no evidence that ill - treatment would result from any discovery that he had failed to complete his military service . Even if ORG and DATE had extra - territorial effect , his brief detention on return would not breach LAW there was no evidence to suggest that he faced criminal , political or other sanctions in GPE .", "The applicant applied for leave to appeal solely on the basis of the Bulletin of ORG ( \u201c CIPU \u201d ) dated DATE ( see the \u201c Domestic Law and Practice \u201d section below ) . Leave to appeal was granted on DATE . The ORG also had before it CARDINAL letters from ORG ( Near East and GPE department ) dated DATE and DATE , which provided an update on the position concerning the return of failed asylum seekers to GPE ( see below ) .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal . Although the history of the matter was \u201c a truly shocking one , as much for the sloth and lack of resolution displayed by ORG in the past as for [ the applicant \u2019s ] own downright wickedness \u201d , the ORG noted that it had to decide whether the applicant \u2019s return to GPE brought with it a real risk . The ORG found as follows :", "\u201c We have to say that there is nothing whatsoever in this case , apart from the existence of the [ CIPU bulletin ] , to suggest that [ the applicant ] would face any real risk of persecution or ill - treatment on return . The policy itself is not a blanket one , and allows for consideration of individual cases by a senior caseworker , which has been done here , resulting in the unusually coherent refusal letters of DATE and DATE . There is nothing to suggest that , if the loathsome crime the [ applicant ] committed here became known to the NORP authorities , he would face any form of double jeopardy for it there . Nor is there anything to suggest he would be regarded by them as any kind of political opponent : if he declared himself as such , as he had threatened , there is nothing to show that he would face any real risk of being taken seriously . The adjudicator was clearly entitled to reach the view he did , and we should have done the same ourselves . \u201d", "On DATE the ORG refused leave to appeal to ORG . His renewed leave application ( under LAW and in relation to the CIPU Bulletin only ) to a single judge of that ORG was rejected on DATE .", "His application to the full ORG was dismissed after a hearing on DATE , ORG finding as follows :", "\u201c What [ the applicant \u2019s representative ] says about the present applicant is that if the applicant is interrogated by the [ NORP ] security authorities , as the CIPU bulletin says he will be , there is , if not a likelihood , at least a risk that they will elicit from him the fact DATE he sought and was refused asylum in this country . This seems to me to be a possibility so remote as not to constitute an appreciable risk at all . The history of the applicant in this country is littered with good reasons for his removal , any CARDINAL of which will intelligibly explain his enforced reappearance in GPE DATE after his first arrival in this country . The immediate cause of his removal , and indeed the only active cause of his removal because of the extraordinary good fortune which he has previously enjoyed , is his deportation for the commission of a crime for which he has served a long punitive term . There is no reason why any other documentation should accompany him and every reason why the notice of deportation can accompany him and provide a perfectly intelligible explanation of his removal . If he wishes he can also draw attention to the fact that , but for the commission of that crime , he would have continued to be the beneficiary of indefinite leave to remain , of which there is also , no doubt , documentary evidence in his or his lawyer \u2019s hands .", "In those circumstances , there is nothing in the documentation to suggest that as a deported criminal the applicant faces any special risk of maltreatment . ... \u201d", "This document was entitled \u201c Enforced Removal of Failed Asylum Seekers \u201d and , in so far as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c Summary", "CARDINAL .

It was the [ Honorary Legal Adviser \u2019s ] considered opinion that a deportee would not face problems on their [ sic ] return if they had not been involved in political activities\u2013 even if they had claimed political asylum , as long as the individual were able to explain the reason behind any claim was based on economic or other [ ie . non - political ] grounds .

The discussion had taken place in GPE . The reason for the Ambassador \u2019s confidence in that NORP official was that the Ambassador , a highly experienced diplomat , had had numerous dealings with him and trusted his judgment . Both of the individuals whose circumstances were outlined to this official had served prison sentences and had been recommended for deportation . The list of assurances which had been sought by the Ambassador included assurances that no - one should be detained unless there was due cause , or harassed or subjected to ill - treatment by the authorities or ill - treated in detention .

Its findings were contained in its report dated DATE .", "As to the NORP intelligence services , the report noted :", "\u201c To ensure both the country \u2019s and PERSON \u2019s security , GPE has a highly active intelligence service that operates both in and outside the country . GPE \u2019s intelligence service comprises several individually independent agencies , which also monitor each other . It is claimed that many NORP constantly feel that they may be under surveillance , which causes a certain amount of fear and caution . The intelligence services\u2019 procedures are not known , but probably take a wide variety of forms , e.g. physical surveillance , compulsory reporting for the various officials , monitoring through communication technology , mass media monitoring etc . It is well known that civil servants are constantly shifted within the administrations and executive departments where they work , to prevent strong , opposing alliances from forming that could threaten the regime . According to experts , this reshuffling of staff strongly contributes to bureaucracy and administrative inefficiency .", "Evidence strongly suggests a recent restructuring of the intelligence NORP methods . They now seem to be less generalised , instead focusing more directly on clearly defined opposition groups and individuals . This change may be a result of the regime wishing to project a more open and less repressive image , or possibly feeling less under threat at present . \u201d", "As to controls on those arriving in GPE :", "\u201c Fairly strict checks are also performed on individual travellers arriving in GPE . The control routines do not appear to be related to the duration and purpose of the visit abroad ( at least not at present ) . We were told that a blacklist is kept . Although it is difficult for outsiders to judge whether this is true , the possibility can not be ruled out . \u201d", "As to the deportation of NORP and their return :", "\u201c The NORP authorities can issue documents to facilitate onward travel or return to GPE . For instance , it is known that NORP authorities on GPE provide NORP with at least provisional travel documents to facilitate their journey . It is not known whether the NORP authorities have special criteria for travel documents in order for NORP to be allowed to enter or return to their native country . It is less likely that the possibility of deportation depends on the possession of certain documents .

ORG concluded :", "\u201c ORG has pointed out that none of the CARDINAL arrests to which the complainant was subjected , were related to his political activities . It also submits that the complainant would not have been able to have his passport stamped on his departure from GPE if he had been exposed to persecution at that time and that the ORG medical report provides no objective indication that he was subjected to gross outrages .

As we have said , [ A ] would not return as a failed , or indeed , successful asylum seeker ; he would return with a truthful story as to his marriages and imprisonment . Further , there is more specific guidance as to how failed asylum seekers or deportees might be treated in the letter of DATE from the ORG ... : a claim of asylum would not lead to problems if it could be explained as being based for economic or other non - political reasons . If the NORP discovered or assumed that such a claim had been made , in the absence of actions against ORG , detention for any length of time was unlikely . Asylum seekers at large in GPE were known to ORG .", "All this has to be set in the context of background evidence showing the continued detention of prisoners of conscience and the killing of some returned NORP asylum seekers .

[ A ] is not a member of any NORP group , which groups appear to be particularly targeted , nor is he a member of any opposition group . This is not to say that there is no risk ; it is rather that the specific assessment made for this Appellant is supported and not contradicted by the changing tone of the more recent background evidence . \u201d", "It is not known if A requested leave to apply for judicial review of this decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
