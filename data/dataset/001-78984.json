NORP The applicant party appealed to a court against the ORG 's refusal to register it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG of GPE , acting as a first - instance court , upheld the ORG 's decision to remove from the list the candidates who had made false representations , but declared unlawful the ORG 's refusal to register the list in its entirety . The court interpreted the term \u201c withdrawal \u201d in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW as meaning only a candidate 's voluntary withdrawal of his or her own free will . The court therefore held that the provision should not apply to a situation where one of the top CARDINAL candidates had been struck off the list by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed against that judgment . The applicant party submitted its observations on the ORG 's grounds of appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG of GPE upheld the judgment of DATE . The court thoroughly analysed the wording of LAW and agreed that the word \u201c withdrawal \u201d in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW should only refer to situations where the candidate 's name had been taken off the list of the candidate 's own free will or at the request of the candidate 's electoral union .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG allowed the registration of the applicant party 's list of candidates .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a deputy Prosecutor General of GPE lodged an application for supervisory review with the Presidium of ORG of GPE . The prosecutor argued that \u201c withdrawal \u201d was a generic term which applied to any situation where a candidate was struck off the list , be it the expression of will of the candidate himself , of his electoral union , or of the ORG . Hence a candidate 's exclusion as a result of the ORG 's decision should count as \u201c withdrawal \u201d and thus render section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW applicable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG of GPE granted the application for supervisory review and quashed the judgment of DATE . The court followed the line of reasoning suggested by the deputy ORG . The court emphasised that the exclusion of a candidate from the list as a result of the ORG 's decision was only a specific instance of \u201c withdrawal \u201d and that the ORG 's refusal to register the list had therefore been lawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG annulled its earlier decisions , refused the registration of the applicant party 's list and ordered the applicant party 's name to be removed from the ballot papers . The applicant party appealed against the ORG 's decision to ORG of GPE . On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed the applicant party 's complaint . The court found that pursuant to the judgment of the ORG of ORG of GPE , the ORG had no discretion in the matter and it was obliged as a matter of law to refuse the registration of the applicant party 's list .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the elections to ORG took place . The applicant party was not listed in the voting papers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE , acting on an application by a group of NORP MPs , declared unconstitutional the part of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW which provided for the refusal or cancellation of a party 's registration in the event of the withdrawal of CARDINAL of the top CARDINAL candidates on the list .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court stressed that the right to stand for election was an individual rather than a collective right . However , the contested provision made the exercise of that right conditional on the consistent presence of the top CARDINAL candidates on the list , which amounted to a restriction on the other candidates ' right to stand for election and on the citizens ' right to vote for them . It violated the principle of equality between the candidates because it only applied in the event of withdrawal of CARDINAL of the top CARDINAL candidates but not of those in lower positions on the list . Such a restriction could not be justified by the special role played by the top CARDINAL candidates , who were usually political heavyweights , in the electoral campaign and it did not serve any legitimate aim listed in the LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , withdrawal of CARDINAL of the top CARDINAL candidates had a disproportionately crippling effect on the electoral union or bloc , which forfeited the right to stand for election through no fault of its own . On the other hand , it made it difficult for the top CARDINAL candidates to leave an electoral union whose platform had changed to the point of being inconsistent with their own views . It also encroached on the active voting rights of the electorate , depriving them of an opportunity to vote for the candidates and impairing the formation of a representative spectrum of members of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG noted that the refusal or cancellation of registration was essentially a sanction imposed on an electoral union or bloc . Sanctions could only be inflicted for violations of the electoral laws and should be proportionate to the violation . However , the contested provision made it possible to sanction electoral unions , blocs and other candidates who had not committed any violation , and this was incompatible with the general principles of justice and rule of law .", "CARDINAL . ORG also ruled that the finding that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) was unconstitutional was of no consequence for the State Duma elections of DATE and could not be relied upon to seek a review of their results .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant party applied to the ORG to have its election deposit paid back .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG informed the applicant party that the election deposit had been credited to the federal budget and could not be repaid . The ORG maintained that the decision of ORG did not apply to the DATE elections and that there was consequently no ground for returning the election deposit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant party brought a civil action against the ORG for the return of the election deposit .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG of GPE dismissed the applicant party 's action . The court based its decision on a provision of LAW to the effect that the election deposit could not be repaid if the party 's list had not been registered in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW . The court held that the applicant party 's request for the return of the deposit on the basis of ORG ruling was in fact a disguised request for a review of the election results , which had been expressly prohibited by ORG .", "CARDINAL .
