NORP The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON NORP ORG , legal officer at ORG , GPE , GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by PERSON , Attorney , Attorney - ORG ) , as their Agent , assisted by PERSON , Attorney .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for asylum in GPE on DATE . On DATE ORG rejected his asylum request but granted him a work- and residence permit on humanitarian grounds ( section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL , PERSON om utlendingers adgang til riket og deres opphold her \u2013 utlendingsloven , applicable at the material time ) .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the ORG convicted the applicant on charges of aggravated assault committed against his former girlfriend . It found established beyond reasonable doubt that he had pushed her to the ground so that she had fallen and hit her head against the asphalt and , while she was lying on the ground , had kicked her twice on her left hand side and had then left the scene . The victim was hospitalised for DATE while suffering from nausea and vomiting , minor head aches , amnesia and pain in the rib on her left side . The applicant was in addition convicted on a count of speeding . ORG , finding that the applicant \u2019s kicking of the victim made the offence borderline to what would warrant a nonsuspended sentence and being in doubt therefore , decided to impose a suspended sentence of CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) , corresponding to MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In the light of his conviction on DATE , ORG warned the applicant on DATE that it contemplated expelling him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to expel the applicant , finding that the conditions under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( c ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE had been fulfilled and that his expulsion would not be disproportionate for the purposes of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) . Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) , the ORG further decided to prohibit the applicant from re - entry into GPE indefinitely .", "CARDINAL . In a separate decision of DATE , the ORG rejected an application by the applicant for renewal of his work- and residence permit . It held that the conditions for granting him such a permit had not been fulfilled as there existed circumstances that warranted refusing him entry into the country .", "CARDINAL . Represented by a new lawyer , the applicant appealed ( via the ORG ) to ORG . He argued that the expulsion was disproportionate as he had settled in GPE and that he was not a criminal in the normal sense of the word . The applicant pointed out that he had not been involved in any criminal offence either before or after those dealt with by ORG . Moreover , GPE was in a state of civil war and there was a high risk of escalation of the internal conflict , meaning that the situation was generally insecure .", "CARDINAL . In a letter to the ORG , dated DATE , the applicant claimed to be of NORP ethnic origin coming from GPE . He also maintained that his previous girlfriend had tried to blackmail him and added that he had a new girlfriend .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s new girlfriend , ORG who was NORP , requested ORG to reconsider its previous rejection . On DATE , he informed the ORG that on DATE he had married GPE", "CARDINAL . NORP On reviewing the above - mentioned arguments , the Directorate did not consider that the appeal contained any new information of significance and maintained its previous decisions . The ORG noted that the applicant had married on DATE , but did not attach great importance to this event since the marriage had occurred after the ORG \u2019s decision of expulsion . It was also pointed out that the applicant was suspected of CARDINAL further incidents of assault , occurred on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively . The ORG consented , however , to postpone the enforcement of his expulsion pending a decision on his appeal , which the ORG referred to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the ORG \u2019s refusal of the applicant \u2019s request for renewal of his work- and residence permit . ORG upheld in part his appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision to expel him indefinitely by limiting the prohibition on re - entry to DATE . It decided that an application for re - entry could be made at the earliest after a period of DATE from his leaving the country .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterated that , according to LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( c ) of LAW DATE , a foreign national might be expelled if he or she had been sentenced in GPE for an offence that was punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding DATE . Moreover , pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , if the person concerned held a work- or residence permit , he or she could only be expelled if the offence was punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year or in the event of violation of inter alia LAW ( assault ) of LAW . ORG , referring to the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence ( for aggravated assault under LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) by ORG of DATE , considered that this condition had been fulfilled in his case .", "CARDINAL . As to the condition in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) that the expulsion should not be a disproportionately severe measure vis - \u00e0 - vis the foreign national himself or his closest family members , ORG first had regard to the seriousness of the offence . ORG had imposed a suspended term of CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment in respect of offences that included assault against his previous girlfriend , resulting in injury to her body and health . This was a relatively serious offence which carried a maximum penalty of CARDINAL PERSON imprisonment . In meting out the sentence , the trial court had held that the fact that applicant had kicked the victim \u2019s body after she had fallen to the ground was an important aggravating factor and had found no mitigating circumstances .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further considered it significant that , on DATE , the applicant had accepted a summary fine ( forelegg ) for an offence of theft ( Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . It in addition noted that on DATE ORG had sentenced him to PERCENT days\u2019 suspended imprisonment in respect of CARDINAL instances of aggravated violent assault ( Article CARDINAL ) and for dealing with stolen goods ( Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) , but without attaching decisive importance thereto , it being unclear whether the judgment had gained legal force .", "CARDINAL . In light of the gravity of the applicant \u2019s offences , ORG found that his personal attachment to GPE carried little weight , as did the fact that he had married a NORP national after the ORG had decided to expel him . At that time they could hardly have entertained any legitimate expectation about being able to live together in GPE . The applicant \u2019s links to the country through his wife had mainly been established after he had committed the offences for which he had been convicted . However , having regard to it being a suspended sentence , to his overall links to GPE and to the ORG \u2019s practice in this area , the latter limited the prohibition on re - entry to DATE . In the ORG \u2019s opinion , the consequent interference with the applicant \u2019s enjoyment of private and family life would be justified for the purposes of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG next considered whether the applicant \u2019s expulsion would be prevented by a real risk of persecution , loss of life or ill - treatment ( section CARDINAL of LAW and LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In this connection , the ORG based its assessment on it having been established that the applicant was of NORP ethic origin and came from GPE , as he had consistently submitted in his request for a residence permit in GPE . His claim on some occasions in DATE and thereafter that he was of NORP origin had weakened his credibility .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant \u2019s individual situation was concerned , ORG noted that the reasons underlying his asylum request had related to the NORP regime and that this regime no longer existed . Nor were there any other circumstances pertaining to the applicant or the conditions in his home country suggesting that he was in need of protection .", "CARDINAL . As to the general security situation in GPE , the ORG stated that it was characterised by violence and disturbance and had been unstable and difficult . GPE had been located in the border region near the NORP autonomous areas in GPE . The NORP population had been in a majority whereas PERSON , NORP and NORP had constituted the largest minority groups . GPE had mainly been under NORP political and military control , though the minorities had also been represented in governing bodies .", "CARDINAL . At times during DATE the level of violence had been high , notably because of the presence of several different militant groups . In GPE the violence had in particular taken the form of shootings , road bombs , suicide bombs and car bombs . The targets of the actions had first and foremost been the security forces and the police , but also local political leaders and their family members as well as members of the civilian population had been affected by actions .", "CARDINAL . The Board nonetheless considered that the current situation had not been such as to regard all citizens in the area as being in imminent danger of loss of life or ill - treatment . The most recent reports on the area , amongst other from ORG , ORG , ORG ) and the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( ORG ) , had showed that the security situation in the area was improving . In comparison with other areas of LOC and Southern GPE , the current violence had been more limited and had to a greater extent been aimed at specific target groups , than was the case in LOC . According to the ORG \u2019s practice , the general security situation in GPE had not on its own constituted a ground for protecting persons of NORP ethnic origin .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant requested ORG to reconsider its above - mentioned refusal of DATE . He argued that his return would be prevented by the security situation in GPE generally and that in GPE specifically . He further submitted that his wife suffered from depression . According to a medical statement from the psychiatric clinic of ORG , in view of her husband \u2019s impending expulsion , her psychological problems had increased with serious suicidal thoughts and impulses . He was important to her and represented a stabilising factor in her life and her mental health . Also , he assumed a significant role as a care person for his stepson who was showing signs of behavioural difficulties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request , finding no hardship exceeding what was normal in a situation of expulsion . Also , the applicant \u2019s relationship to his spouse and stepchildren had been established essentially after he had committed the offences for which he had been convicted . ORG reiterated that the prohibition on re - entry had been limited to DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the question whether the general situation in GPE was such as to prevent the applicant \u2019s return , the ORG restated the findings made in its decision of DATE summarised above . It noted that in its recommendations of DATE and Eligibility Guidelines of DATE , and the Addendum thereto of DATE , as well as ORG of DATE , the ORG had advised against any forcible return to the CARDINAL governorates of LOC ( GPE , GPE , PERSON , PERSON , NORP ) and considered that persons coming from these areas should be recognised as refugees . The ORG had assumed in its recommendations that persons who were not recognised as refugees should nevertheless be granted protection . The ORG had amongst other referred to the general situation of violence , the great number of internally displaced people , the authorities\u2019 inability and unwillingness to provide protection , the high unemployment , limited access to fuel , electricity and water and great shortcomings in public health services , education etc .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterated that ORG recommendations were relevant and had to be given weight , both as information about the general situation in GPE and as part of the interpretation of whom had a right to protection under LAW . However , the ORG recommendations could not be decisive of their own . ORG had to have regard to other information and reach a correct decision in accordance with LAW and other relevant rules . ORG also took account of the fact that the ORG recommendations had regard to humanitarian and socioeconomic considerations , not only to the security situation and the danger of being affected by violence .", "CARDINAL . Although the security situation in GPE was difficult and unstable , ORG did not consider that the current situation was of such a nature that all the inhabitants of the region could be said to face a real risk of losing their lives or of being made to suffer inhuman treatment . Nor were there factors related to the applicant \u2019s NORP origin that indicated that he would face a real risk of losing his life or being made to suffer inhuman treatment if he were to return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In this connection , the ORG reiterated that , throughout his application to stay in GPE , the applicant had maintained that he was of NORP ethnic origin and that so was his father . The fact that the applicant in DATE onwards had claimed to be of NORP origin detracted from his general credibility .", "CARDINAL . In its decision ORG also provided information about a voluntary repatriation program that had operated since DATE , covering the Dahuk , GPE and GPE in LOC and opening also for the possibility to apply for repatriation to other areas . It was sponsored by ORG and implemented by ORG . Under this program a returnee would be eligible to receive ORG MONEY ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in cash and be offered an additional NOK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in resettlement support .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought to bring his case to the attention of a number of instances , including to the King , the Prime Minister and various ministries , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of CARDINAL DATE No . CARDINAL ( tvisteloven ) , a decision by ORG could form the subject of an appeal to the competent city court or district court ( tingrett ) ( ORG CARDINAL , DATE , DATE ) , from there to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) ( ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) and ultimately to ORG ( Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . The domestic courts had full jurisdiction to review the lawfulness of the ORG \u2019s decision and were empowered to quash the decision should they find that it was unlawful . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , the provisions of the LAW were to be applied in accordance with GPE \u2019s international legal obligations intended to strengthen the legal position of a foreign national . In the event of conflict between the national legal provision and GPE \u2019s obligations under the Convention , the latter was to take precedence ( sections QUANTITY and CARDINAL of LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under Chapters CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , a person whose expulsion had been ordered by the immigration authorities could apply to the courts for an interlocutory injunction to stay the implementation of the expulsion order .", "CARDINAL . Further conditions regarding judicial review of ORG decision were set out inter alia in the following provisions and guidelines .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , the fee for filing a lawsuit before ORG or ORG ( tingrett ) was ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , corresponding to approximately FAC , if the hearing lasted for DATE and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) if the hearing lasted for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL ( rettsgebyrloven ) , fees should be paid in advance . In the event that a sufficient amount had not been paid when a request for a judicial order had been made , the court was to fix a brief time - limit for payment . In the event that payment is not effected within the time - limit fixed , the court shall dismiss the case , unless the provisions in section CARDINAL apply . The latter provided :", "\u201c If a party has applied for free legal aid or for exemption from the payment of court fees under LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL [ rettshjelploven ] , a respite should be granted until the application has been decided . In this event no security can be required for the payment of the fee .", "If a party who has requested a procedural step [ rettergangsskritt ] has obtained respite in accordance with the foregoing , the court shall grant the measure . In other cases the court may grant a measure if the party who has requested it is unable to pay immediately and it would entail a damage or significant inconvenience for that party if the measure is not taken .
