The applicant was born in DATE . When lodging his application with the ORG , he was detained in FAC . Since DATE he has been detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG convicted the applicant , a first offender , of CARDINAL counts of murder and CARDINAL count of attempted murder committed DATE . The applicant was found to have killed or have attempted to kill in his car CARDINAL young women he had not previously known treacherously and in order to satisfy his sexual desires . He had strangulated a DATE hitchhiker during his lunch - break , had strangulated CARDINAL prostitutes during or after sexual intercourse with them and had attempted to strangulate a third prostitute in the same manner . The GPE am ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment and ordered his placement in a psychiatric hospital ( LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court , having consulted a psychiatric and a psychological expert who had diagnosed the applicant with a sadist sexual deviation , lack of empathy and a brain damage , found that the applicant suffered from a serious mental abnormality and had acted with diminished criminal responsibility . Furthermore , owing to that condition , the applicant was liable to reoffend and was therefore dangerous to the public .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that the conditions for the applicant \u2019s preventive detention under LAW ( see paragraph QUANTITY below ) were equally met . However , even though it did not appear very likely that the applicant \u2019s condition could be treated , it could not be wholly excluded that a therapy might prove successful . Therefore , the court decided , by reference to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , to order the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital and not in preventive detention as the former was the more suitable measure of correction and prevention in these circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was accordingly transferred to PERSON psychiatric hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant serve his prison sentence prior to his continued placement in a psychiatric hospital as a therapy of the applicant had not proven successful . The applicant then served his full sentence in FAC . On DATE the applicant requested his release , arguing that he had served his full sentence on DATE . Thereupon , he was again transferred to ORG in DATE on the basis of his conviction in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG terminated the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital pursuant to Article CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . That decision became final on DATE . Having regard to the findings of an expert it had consulted , it found that the applicant had in fact not suffered from a disorder which had made him act with diminished criminal responsibility at the time he had committed his offences and which had warranted his placement in a psychiatric hospital . By a decision of DATE , ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s provisional detention pending the competent court \u2019s decision whether or not he was to be placed in preventive detention retrospectively . The latter order became final on DATE . The applicant was then detained in FAC since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG , relying on Article CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE and DATE below ) , ordered the applicant \u2019s preventive detention retrospectively ( nachtr\u00e4gliche GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The GPE am ORG found that , as required by LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , the applicant had been placed in a psychiatric hospital pursuant to LAW after having committed several of the offences listed in LAW , first sentence , namely several murders . On DATE ORG had terminated the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital pursuant to LAW as the condition diminishing the applicant \u2019s criminal responsibility on which the placement order had been based had never existed and thus did not persist at the time of the decision terminating the placement . It was irrelevant whether or not the placement in a psychiatric hospital had been based on a wrong diagnosis from the outset .", "CARDINAL . The GPE am ORG further considered that a comprehensive assessment of the applicant , his offences and , in addition , his development during the execution of his placement in a psychiatric hospital revealed that it was very likely that he would again commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) . Having regard to the convincing findings of CARDINAL psychiatric experts it had consulted and to the statements made by the doctors who had attempted to motivate the applicant to undergo therapy in prison and in the psychiatric hospital , the court found that it was very likely that the applicant , if released , would commit offences similar to those which he had been convicted of in DATE . Less restrictive measures , in particular the supervision of the applicant \u2019s conduct , would be insufficient to protect the public from him .", "CARDINAL . NORP The psychiatric experts PERSON , who had been obliged to draw up their reports on the basis of the case files as the applicant had refused to have himself examined by them , had considered that there was a high risk that the applicant would commit further murders for sexual motives or in order to cover up previous violent sexual offences if released . He had committed a series of murders without any comprehensible motives arising from his personal situation . Even though he did not suffer from a true sadistic deviation , his acts had disclosed a combination of aggressive and sadistic sexual elements . He was particularly dangerous for his lack of empathy and his refusal to reflect on his offences and to undergo treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . He took the view that Article CARDINAL of LAW was incompatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded . On DATE the applicant was transferred to FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He argued that LAW of LAW and the decisions of the lower courts , based on that provision , to order his preventive detention retrospectively were incompatible with LAW . He stressed that the sentencing court in DATE , in a final judgment , had deliberately declined to place him in preventive detention . The said provision and decisions therefore breached the prohibition to increase a penalty retrospectively ( LAW ) as well as the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations in a ORG governed by the rule of law and the prohibition to be punished twice for the same offence . The failure to release him following the termination of his placement in a psychiatric hospital further violated his right to liberty under LAW ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a chamber of CARDINAL judges of ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint \u2013 as well as that of another applicant who lodged application no . CARDINAL before the Court \u2013 on the grounds that it was ill - founded ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and Article CARDINALb \u00a7 CARDINAL had been inserted into LAW because , under ORG well - established case - law , a person could no longer be detained in a psychiatric hospital under LAW and had to be released if that person no longer suffered from a condition excluding or diminishing his criminal responsibility . This was considered problematic in cases in which the person concerned , without suffering or without ever having suffered from the said condition , was still dangerous to the public .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that Article CARDINAL of LAW and the lower courts\u2019 decision to order the applicant \u2019s placement in preventive detention retrospectively were compatible with LAW . Article CARDINAL of LAW did not breach the ban on the retrospective application of criminal laws imposed by LAW . That Article applied only to ORG measures which expressed sovereign censure of illegal and culpable conduct and involved the imposition of a sanction to compensate for guilt . Unlike such a penalty , preventive detention was not aimed at punishing criminal guilt , but was a purely preventive measure aimed at protecting the public from a dangerous offender . For the same reason , Article CARDINAL of LAW did not breach the right not to be punished twice for the same offence under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further took the view that LAW was in conformity with the protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law , even if applied to a case such as that of the applicant , who had committed his offences and had been convicted and sentenced prior to the entry into force of the said provision . It considered as compatible with LAW the legislator \u2019s decision whereby the effective protection of the public from very dangerous offenders who were liable to commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims \u2013 which was a paramount public interest \u2013 outweighed the offender \u2019s interest in protection of his legitimate expectations .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the impugned provisions allowed the courts in a case like that of the applicant to amend retrospectively a sanction fixed in a previous final judgment in the light of new evidence ( in particular new expert reports ) , without new facts having come up . It emphasised that the sentencing criminal court \u2019s decision not to order preventive detention became final even if it later emerged that the court had erred in considering the offender not to be dangerous . Nevertheless , the retrospective preventive detention order under LAW of LAW , read in conjunction with Article CARDINAL of LAW , entailed only very limited disadvantages of constitutional relevance . In substance , the ordering of a measure of indefinite duration depriving the person concerned of his or her liberty DATE namely , placement in a psychiatric hospital DATE was merely replaced , under certain qualified conditions , by the ordering of a different such measure of indefinite duration , namely preventive detention . Any remaining disadvantages for the offender in the protection of his legitimate expectations were outweighed by the paramount interest of the public pursued by the provisions in question .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further found that Article CARDINAL of LAW was compatible with the applicant \u2019s right to liberty under LAW ( LAW ) . In order to protect the right to life , physical integrity and liberty of citizens the legislator was authorised , within the limits set by the principle of proportionality , to deprive of his liberty a person who could be expected to violate the ORG said rights .", "CARDINAL . NORP In FAC , persons in preventive detention are placed in a separate building from prisoners serving their sentence . They have certain minor privileges compared with convicted offenders serving their sentence ( see , for instance , PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG DATE ) . As regards therapeutic measures , persons held in preventive detention in PERSON are offered a DATE discussion group proposing ideas for recreational activities and for structuring DATE life . They are further offered discussions with an external psychiatrist once per DATE as well as psychological or psychotherapeutic measures and social training considered suitable for them . Furthermore , a psychologist and a social worker were available permanently to discuss with the detainees .", "CARDINAL . When transferred to ORG on DATE , the applicant refused to discuss the planning of the execution of the preventive detention order with the prison staff , which therefore considered his transfer to a social therapeutic institution as lacking prospects of success . He worked in prison from DATE until DATE and has been out of work since then . In DATE the applicant participated in a DATE social training course in prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused to suspend the applicant \u2019s further preventive detention and to grant probation . It found that it could not be expected that the applicant would not commit any further offences if released ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It noted that the applicant still considered it unnecessary to reflect on his offences or to undergo a therapy . The decision became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to terminate the applicant \u2019s preventive detention . It found again that it could not be expected that the applicant would not commit any further offences if released ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . On the contrary , there was a danger that if released , the applicant , owing to specific circumstances relating to his person and his conduct in prison , would commit serious crimes of violence as defined by ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , namely treacherous murders to satisfy his sexual desires .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered , in particular , that according to the pertinent findings of ORG in the said judgment , a retrospective order of preventive detention following the termination of a person \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital did not breach the protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law or the prohibition of retrospective punishment . As the judgments of ORG only had the force of Federal legislation in GPE , the fact that that court had considered , in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( PERSON GPE , cited above ) , that retrospective preventive detention was in breach of human rights , did not alter that conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the GPE am ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It agreed with ORG that the stricter standards set up by ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) for a continuation of preventive detention which had been ordered retrospectively under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL of LAW did not apply to preventive detention ordered under paragraph CARDINAL of that provision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against these decisions . The proceedings before that court are apparently still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed as inadmissible the applicant \u2019s request for a reopening of the proceedings in which his retrospective preventive detention had been ordered in DATE . In particular , a reopening on the ground that ORG had found a domestic court \u2019s judgment to be in breach of the LAW applied only to applicants who had themselves obtained a judgment of that court in their favour . Moreover , the facts at issue in the M. v. GPE case ( cited above ) were not sufficiently comparable to those in the present case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive summary of the provisions of LAW and of LAW governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention , in particular preventive detention , and the making , review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders , is contained in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ) . A summary of the provisions of LAW the right to liberty ( LAW ) and the ban on retrospective application of criminal laws ( LAW ) can also be found in that judgment ( ibid . , LAW and DATE ) . The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows :", "CARDINAL . Measures of correction and prevention ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) cover , in particular , placement in a psychiatric hospital ( LAW ) or in preventive detention ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code governs orders for a person \u2019s preventive detention made by the sentencing court when finding the person guilty of an offence . That court may , at the time of the offender \u2019s conviction , order his preventive detention ( a so - called measure of correction and prevention ) under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence ( a penalty ) , if the offender has been shown to be a danger to the public .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , first sentence , of LAW , in its version in force at the time of the order for the applicant \u2019s retrospective preventive detention , preventive detention may be ordered in addition to a prison sentence if the perpetrator is sentenced for certain serious offences , including murder , rape and dangerous assault , to DATE imprisonment , if he has previously been convicted ( only ) once of CARDINAL or more such offences to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment and if the remaining requirements laid down in LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) are met .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code governs the combination of different measures of correction and prevention . If the conditions for several such measures are met , yet the desired objective may be attained by one or a part of these measures , then only those latter measures shall be ordered ( see Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Otherwise , such measures shall be ordered cumulatively unless the law provides otherwise ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Retrospective Preventive Detention Act ( Gesetz zur Einf\u00fchrung der nachtr\u00e4glichen GPE ) of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , inserted Articles CARDINALb and QUANTITY into LAW ; the latter provision was amended by LAW of DATE . The provisions in question were aimed at preventing the release of persons who could no longer be detained in a psychiatric hospital because the conditions for placement under LAW were no longer met ( including cases in which they had never been met from the outset ) , but who were still dangerous to the public ( see ORG documents ( ORG ) , no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In fact , under the case - law previously established by the courts dealing with the execution of sentences , a person \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital had to be terminated and the person concerned had to be released if he no longer suffered , or had in fact never suffered , from a condition excluding or diminishing his criminal responsibility , even if that person was still dangerous to the public ( see ORG , no .

The said CARDINAL provisions remained valid also under LAW ( Gesetz zur Neuordnung des Rechts der Sicherungsverwahrung ) of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , for offences committed after the entry into force of that LAW . As a result of the abolition of paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Article CARDINALb of LAW by LAW , the former paragraph CARDINAL , slightly amended , became the only provision of that Article .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code governs the duration of preventive detention . Paragraph CARDINAL , first sentence , of that LAW provides that if there is no provision for a maximum duration or if the time - limit has not yet expired , the court shall suspend on probation the further execution of the detention order as soon as it is to be expected that the person concerned will not commit any further unlawful acts on his release .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code governs the detention of mentally ill persons as a measure of correction and prevention if the detention is ordered in relation to an unlawful act committed by the person concerned . It provides that if someone commits an unlawful act without criminal responsibility or with diminished criminal responsibility , the court shall order his placement \u2013 without any maximum duration \u2013 in a psychiatric hospital if a comprehensive assessment of the defendant and his acts reveals that , as a result of his condition , he can be expected to commit serious unlawful acts and that he is therefore a danger to the general public .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG delivered a leading judgment concerning the retrospective prolongation of the ORG preventive detention beyond the former DATE maximum period and also concerning the retrospective order for a complainant \u2019s preventive detention under LAW of LAW ( file FAC . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Reversing its previous position , ORG held that all provisions concerned , both on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective ordering of such detention , were incompatible with LAW as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law , read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further held that all the relevant provisions of LAW on the imposition and duration of preventive detention were incompatible with the fundamental right to liberty of persons in preventive detention . It found that those provisions did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment ( PERSON ) . These provisions included , in particular , LAW in its version in force since DATE and LAW in its version of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered that all provisions declared incompatible with LAW remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation and until DATE at the latest . In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged retrospectively , or ordered retrospectively under LAW of LAW ( but not preventive detention ordered LAW ) , the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned , owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct , were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if , additionally , they suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the newly enacted Therapy Detention Act . As regards the notion of mental disorder , ORG explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of \u201c persons of unsound mind \u201d in LAW sub - paragraph ( e ) of the LAW made in this ORG \u2019s case - law ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) . If the above pre - conditions were not met , those detainees had to be released DATE . The other provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention could only be further applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality ; as a general rule , proportionality was only respected where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , ORG relied on the interpretation of LAW made by ORG in its judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above ; see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ss . of ORG judgment ) . It stressed , in particular , that the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment and the principles laid down in LAW required an individualised and intensified offer of therapy and care to the persons concerned . In line with the ORG \u2019s findings in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , it was necessary to provide a high level of care by a team of multi - disciplinary staff and to offer the detainees an individualised therapy if the standard therapies available in the institution did not have prospects of success ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["7"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["7-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
