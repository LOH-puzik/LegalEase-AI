The judge noted that the Minister had accepted that the applicants were in an equivalent position to their fellow officers in terms of rank and DATE of service , but had submitted that there was a reasonable distinction between the CARDINAL groups : the latter group had sought to vindicate their rights through the courts and thus the extra benefits they had received were provided pursuant to LAW ( the right to damages in administrative recourse proceedings before ORG : see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The judge found that the only distinction between the CARDINAL groups was that the other officers had submitted their requests for voluntary retirement after succeeding in their applications to ORG . There was thus no reasonable distinction between those officers and the applicants and , in the applicants\u2019 case , there had been a violation of LAW of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister appealed against the decision of the single judge to the plenary of ORG and , on DATE , the plenary court allowed the Minister \u2019s appeal ( appeal no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The court found that applicants had accepted the terms of their retirement unconditionally and without reservation . By contrast , the other officers had contested the legality of the ORG \u2019s decisions in their cases and they had subsequently received benefits that were determined in light of ORG judgment annulling the ORG \u2019s decisions .
