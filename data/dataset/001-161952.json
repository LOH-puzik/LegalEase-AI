The applicant intended to organise a demonstration protesting against \u201c the persecution of national radicalism \u201d . It was planned to take place TIME on DATE . The venue was FAC in GPE Xth District , in front of GPE Penitentiary .", "CARDINAL . Venyige Street is of a width of QUANTITY in the Government \u2019s submissions and of QUANTITY in the applicant \u2019s . PERSON to the main driveway , there is a service lane , of a width equivalent to that of CARDINAL cars ; this area is normally used as a car park . In the applicant \u2019s submissions , this latter section could have accommodated largely all the participants , without them creating any major traffic incident .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , in the notification addressed to ORG under Act no . III of DATE on ORG , indicated that a maximum of CARDINAL participants were to be expected . This notification was made at TIME on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG banned the demonstration , in pursuit of its prerogatives under section TIME ) of Act no . III of DATE . It was of the view that there was no alternative route for the traffic in the neighbourhood , and consequently the demonstration would impede traffic inordinately . The applicant was reproached with the fact that the notification did not contain the agenda for the gathering .", "CARDINAL . Because of this prohibition , the demonstration did not take place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested judicial review of the police decision . He explained inter alia that he had not specified the agenda because the meeting had been intended as a rather small CARDINAL and that therefore the actual course of events , such as speeches or discussion , was hard to predict .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint . It observed that the question of previous notification of the agenda was immaterial , since the only valid reason in the case was the disproportionate difficulties which would be caused to traffic by the demonstration .", "CARDINAL . The court relied on the expert opinion provided by ORG of ORG , in whose view the demonstration would have significantly impeded the traffic heading to the shops located in FAC , a dead end , to the local waste disposal site and to the ORG entrance of FAC ; and the disruption caused by the crowd might have extended to FAC , a major thoroughfare in the vicinity with lines of city transport involved . Relying on that reasoning , the court endorsed the police decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
