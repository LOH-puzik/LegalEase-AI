The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . By a court decision of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for causing serious injury ( a broken forearm ) to a third person . On DATE he started serving his sentence in FAC ( \u201c the prison \u201d ) where he was responsible for livestock .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was attacked by a bull , which was not castrated , as a result of which he sustained numerous bodily injuries . After the incident he was transferred by prison vehicle to \u0160tip hospital , where he underwent surgery . The ORG covered the medical expenses . On DATE the bull was put down . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was released from the hospital . DATE , Mr GPE , the prison governor , ordered him to be released early from prison on account of good behaviour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a civil action against the ORG and the prison ( \u201c the defendants \u201d ) claiming non - pecuniary damages for the injuries sustained by the bull . His claim was based , inter alia , on sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the then valid LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . He claimed that the bull had attacked him despite the fact that the prison authorities had been alerted about the aggressiveness of the bull , by himself and a certain PERSON ( the first name of Mr PERSON , as established in the course of the compensation proceedings , later referred to as Mr PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing of DATE , Mr PERSON stated that he , with the applicant and Mr GPE , had been looking after CARDINAL animals , including the bull . He confirmed that the bull had attacked him and other prisoners , including Mr GPE and Mr GPE , and that PERSON , a prison guard on duty , had been warned on several occasions before the incident about the aggressiveness of the bull . In a certified written statement of DATE , Mr GPE , a prisoner at that time , confirmed that the bull had been aggressive and that Mr A.B. had been informed of the fact .", "CARDINAL . Mr A.B. stated that the applicant , in view of his previous experience in handling cattle , had asked to work on the prison farm . Due to his good behaviour , the prison authorities had granted his request despite initial concerns related to his criminal record . After a DATE \u2019s work - related induction course , the applicant started working on the prison farm . He remained on the farm for DATE before he was allowed pasture duties . That corresponded to the practice already established in the prison . After the incident the bull was lame , which according to him , had been due to the injuries on his buttocks . He had called PERSON , a vet , to examine the bull . DATE , in the presence of PERSON , the bull had been put down . He denied that the applicant or any other prisoner had ever alerted him that the bull was aggressive .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , a prisoner at that time who worked on the prison farm , stated that before the incident prisoners had often provoked the bull . He had not heard that any prisoner had ever mentioned , to the prison authorities or to him , that the bull was aggressive .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing of DATE , PERSON stated that the bull had been regularly examined and treated when needed . He denied that it had been aggressive . He confirmed that immediately after the incident he had visually examined the bull and noticed injuries to the rear of its body , the buttocks and testicles , which according to him , had been inflicted by a blunt object . Those injuries were confirmed in the post mortem report which PERSON had drawn up DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant objected to this report , arguing , inter alia , that ( CARDINAL ) it was inaccurate , ( CARDINAL ) it was biased and had been ordered by the ORG , as was evident from the date , DATE , which had been stamped on it and ( CARDINAL ) it could not have been post mortem , since on DATE , DATE it had allegedly been drawn up , the bull was still alive .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the applicant stated that owing to his DATE experience in rearing livestock he had been assigned to work on the prison farm . Initially , the bull was not aggressive , but it had become anxious during the cows\u2019 mating season . He confirmed Mr PERSON \u2019s statement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and denied that he had ever hit the bull . He maintained that he had alerted PERSON about the aggressiveness of the bull , but that he had never informed , orally or in writing , Mr GPE , the prison governor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court ruled partly in favour of the applicant , ordering the ORG to pay him compensation in the amount of MONEY ( ORG , equivalent to MONEY ( ORG ) ) for the injuries , which an expert established as serious . The court established that the ORG owned the bull , which was considered dangerous within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Referring to the above statements , the court established that the bull had been aggressive and had attacked others . It further rejected as unsubstantiated the arguments of the ORG that the applicant had contributed to the incident by hitting the bull . In this connection it disregarded the expert report of PERSON for the reasons advanced in the applicant \u2019s objection ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Both parties appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG remitted the case for fresh consideration so that the lower court could establish who had owned the bull .", "CARDINAL . In this respect , the defendants submitted in evidence extracts from the court register according to which an economic unit PERSON ( \u201c the economic unit \u201d ) , which operated as a separate legal entity within the prison , had been the owner of the bull . The economic unit was established on DATE by a decision of the Government . It was run by Mr M.K.", "CARDINAL . In a submission of DATE , the applicant argued that the defendants had been responsible for the injuries , in particular due to the fact that they had failed , despite having been alerted about the aggressiveness of the bull , to take any measures to protect him .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing of DATE , Mr PERSON stated that no prisoner had ever complained about the aggressiveness of the bull , either to Mr PERSON or to him . He confirmed that the economic unit was the owner of the bull , that it was a separate legal entity and that he ran it , as provided for in section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He further submitted that the applicant had received a DATE work - related allowance from the economic unit .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant reiterated that he had complained orally to PERSON about the aggressiveness of the bull on several occasions , but that no complaint whatsoever had been submitted to Mr PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim , as the defendants did not have the necessary capacity to act in the proceedings . Relying on the extract from the court register ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and Mr PERSON \u2019s statement , it found that the economic unit was the owner of the bull , and that accordingly the defendants bore no responsibility , under section CARDINAL of LAW , for the injuries the applicant had sustained . In support was an invoice dated after the killing of the bull , according to which the prison had paid the economic unit for the meat . The applicant was ordered to pay the defendants\u2019 costs .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant appealed , arguing that no consideration had been given to the ORG \u2019s responsibility for ORG health and physical integrity , given that he had been injured while in custody . He argued that ORG rights and freedoms should be guaranteed by putting in place control and supervisory mechanisms . He further complained that the first - instance court had failed to establish whether the ORG , being responsible to protect him while in custody , had undertaken all necessary measures to avoid damage from occurring . In this latter respect , he complained that the prison authorities , despite having been informed that the bull was aggressive , had failed to take any measure to protect him ( the applicant ) . Lastly , he argued that he had been ordered to look after livestock by the prison authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , finding no grounds to depart from the established facts and reasoning given by the lower court . The applicant received this decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the public prosecutor to lodge a request for the protection of legality with ORG .
