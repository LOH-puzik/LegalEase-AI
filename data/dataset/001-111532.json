The first applicant , PERSON , is an unincorporated association which did not inform the ORG of any registered address . The second applicant , Mr PERSON , an NORP national who lives in GPE , is the appointed representative of the first applicant for the purposes of the proceedings before the ORG . The third to seventeenth applicants ( see list appended ) are members or supporters of the first applicant residing in GPE and GPE ( applicant no . CARDINAL ) . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON of ORG solicitors , a law - firm practising in GPE .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their agent , PERSON , of ORG and by Mr PERSON , professor of international law at ORG .", "Having been informed on DATE of their right to submit written observations , ORG indicated to the ORG that they did not intend to take part in the proceedings . ORG did not express an intention to take part in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant , whose name means \u201c ORG \u201d , describes itself as a \u201c global NORP political party and/or religious society \u201d . It was established in GPE in DATE and advocates the overthrow of governments throughout the NORP world and their replacement by an NORP State in the form of a recreated ORG . The first applicant has achieved a small , but highly committed following in a number of NORP states and has also gained popularity among NORP in LOC . In GPE , where the first applicant has been active since DATE , it has CARDINAL followers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG of the Interior ( ORG ) issued a decision by which it proscribed the first applicant \u2019s activities within NORP territory under sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL in conjunction with sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG ( see relevant domestic law , below ) . It further ordered the first applicant \u2019s assets to be confiscated . Assets of third parties were confiscated as far as they had been intentionally used or were intended to be used to promote the first applicant \u2019s illegal activities .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry considered that the first applicant was a foreign private association operating on an international scale and that there existed no known sub - organisation in GPE . Its activities in GPE included the distribution of leaflets and brochures and the distribution of information via internet as well as , more recently , the organisation of public events .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry considered that the first applicant \u2019s activities were directed against the principle of international understanding and that the applicant advocated the use of violence as a means to achieve its political goals . The organisation \u2019s mouthpiece and ideological platform in GPE was the DATE magazine \u201c FAC .", "CARDINAL . Basing its decision on the book \u201c The inevitability of the battle of cultures \u201d , published in DATE by the organisation \u2019s founder , ORG , as well as on a number of publications attributed to the first applicant , in particular articles published in the magazine \u201c PERSON , leaflets and publications on the organisation \u2019s website , ORG considered that the first applicant denied the right of GPE to exist and called for its destruction and for the killing of NORP . This constituted an expression of the applicant \u2019s basic philosophical position , which included the \u201c active Jihad \u201d . The applicant agitated in a targeted fashion against NORP States and the governments , which overthrow it repeatedly called for . It pursued its objectives , which were directed against the concept of international understanding , in a pro - actively aggressive manner . It did not thereby restrict itself to merely criticising existing political or social conditions or rejecting peaceful coexistence between GPE and peoples but also called for the armed struggle against the State of GPE , NORP and ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further considered that the first applicant was not a political party , as it did not intend to stand for elections in GPE . It further held that the first applicant was not to be regarded as a religious or philosophical community ( Religions- oder PERSON ) , as it did not pursue religious , but political objectives .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , represented by counsel , lodged an application against the prohibition order with ORG ) . They alleged , in particular , that the prohibition violated their right to freedom of religion under LAW . They denied that they advocated the use of violence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the first applicant to submit evidence as to where the organisation was based . On DATE the first applicant pointed out that its organisation was prohibited in all NORP states , they were thus forced to work clandestinely and were unable to reveal the organisation \u2019s address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG severed the first applicant \u2019s application from the remainder of the proceedings and declared it admissible . That court considered that the first applicant had the legal standing to lodge an application against the prohibition order . Furthermore , it had been properly represented before the court . On DATE , ORG orally informed the applicants , that , under its established case - law ( compare paragraph CARDINAL , below ) actions lodged by individual members of a prohibited association were to be declared inadmissible . A decision on the admissibility of the remaining applicants\u2019 actions was postponed until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second to seventeenth applicants withdrew their applications with reference to the indication given by ORG as to the inadmissibility of their applications . On DATE ORG decided to discontinue the proceedings insofar as they concerned the applications lodged by these applicants .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its submissions dated CARDINAL and DATE , the first applicant accepted that it was not to be regarded as a political party within the meaning of the relevant law . The first applicant claimed , however , that all its activities had a religious foundation and that it enjoyed the protection of freedom of religion under LAW . It further submitted that the Government had misconstrued the nature of its ideology , stressing , in particular , that the first applicant promoted peaceful dialogue and had never advocated the use of violence . It contested that the magazine \u201c PERSON was the organisation \u2019s mouthpiece . The first applicant further pointed out that it did not seek to establish a \u201c caliphate \u201d in any of the NORP democracies . Lastly , it complained of a violation of its rights under Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by court order without a prior oral hearing , rejected the first applicant \u2019s application as unfounded . Relying on the so - called \u201c organisational law \u201d submitted by the applicants , the court considered that the first applicant did not fulfil the requirements of a religious community , as its activities did not include the exercise of a common religious practice . Furthermore , the first applicant could not be regarded as a philosophical community , as its existence and activities were based on ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG further confirmed that the first applicant \u2019s activities were directed against the principle of international understanding and were thus subject to prohibition under LAW of LAW in conjunction with ORG . Examining the sources already relied upon by ORG , the court considered that numerous statements were attributable to the applicant , which called for the violent elimination of ORG and for the physical destruction of human lives and thus worked contrary to a peaceful resolution of LOC conflict .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considered that articles published in the magazine \u201c Explizit \u201d contained denials of GPE \u2019s right to exist and called for the violent elimination of ORG or for people to be killed . The LAW \u201c PERSON noch ? \u201d ( How long ? ; PERSON , issue no . DATE , p. CARDINAL et seqq . ) addressed the political and military situation in GPE . The article sharply criticised the NORP peace deal adopted at the summit meeting of GPE in GPE in DATE . This was followed by criticism of the NORP authority , which was accused of not pursuing the goal of", "\u201c freeing GPE , but of handing over GPE in the name of the NORP people to the NORP . \u201d", "This assessment was followed by the statement :", "\u201c As NORP , we must be clear that the problem of \u201c GPE \u201d is not a border issue but an existential issue . The NORP foreign body at the heart of the NORP world can under no circumstances be allowed to continue to exist ... We repeat again the unalterable NORP duty : There can only be one response to the NORP aggression in GPE : Jihad . Allah , the Exalted , commands : \u201c And slay them wherever ye catch them , and turn them out from where they have turned you out \u201d ( PERSON CARDINAL , PERSON ) . \u201d", "This was followed by the opinion that GPE was to be overcome by military means and that the", "\u201c NORP armies ( had ) never really fought against the NORP aggressor \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the call to Jihad in the article represented a summons to violently eliminate ORG . It conceded that the term \u201c Jihad \u201d was multilayered in NORP usage , referring to more than just the \u201c Holy War \u201d . The term described every endeavour , effort and strengthening of ORG . What was decisive in the present context , however , was how the term was to be understood by readers in the context of the article . It was embedded in the statement that GPE could on no account be allowed to continue to exist and the summons to eliminate the ORG by military means . In this context there could be no doubt that the call to ORG was aimed at the violent destruction of GPE as a solution to the NORP - Palestinian conflict . This interpretation corresponded to the quotation from the DATE relied upon in the article . It did not have to be decided how this quotation was to be understood in its original context . In the context of the article , it constituted a call to take violent action with the intention of causing physical destruction and banishment .", "CARDINAL . In the article \u201c PERSON \u2013 Happy Birthday GPE ? \u201d ( DATE Happy birthday GPE ? , PERSON , issue no . CARDINAL , DATE , p. CARDINAL et seqq . ) it was stated that the creation of ORG to the detriment of the NORP people was accompanied by crimes against humanity and that GPE thus lacked legitimacy . The article closed with the following statement :", "\u201c Whoever accepts the State of GPE is against Allah \u2019s commands and thus commits a serious sin . \u201d", "This was followed by a quotation from the Qur\u2019an of a \u201c command by Allah \u201d :", "\u201c And fight for Allah against those who fight against you , but do not transgress ! Truly , Allah loves those who do not transgress . And slay them wherever ye catch them , and turn them out from where they have turned you out . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court considered that it could be left open whether the denial of GPE \u2019s right to exist already breached the concept of international understanding . An any rate , that concept had been interfered with as soon as the assertion was followed by a call violently to eliminate ORG , as had been the case with regard to the quotation from the DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG analysed the content of one further article published in the magazine PERSON in DATE and concluded that that article also contained a call for the destruction of the State of GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the court , there were a number of indications , which taken as a whole , left no doubt that there was a close link between the magazine \u201c PERSON and the first applicant , and that therefore the articles discussed in the above were attributable to the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . The call to eliminate the State of GPE by force and to kill people was not restricted to the magazine \u201c PERSON . Among other sources , the court referred to a transcript dated DATE of a programme broadcast on GPE local television about a debate on LOC conflict at ORG , according to which the second applicant said the following with regard to suicide attacks in GPE :", "\u201c These actions would be banned in GPE or in other countries in the West \u2013 since ORG rejects violence against civilians , but there are no civilians in GPE ; all of them , women and men , are part of the military and the founding of GPE was an act of aggression . Everyone who goes to GPE and lives there is complicit in it . An attack on an institution with adults inside is an act of self - defence . If children are also killed , their parents are responsible for having decided to live in GPE . \u201d", "ORG considered that these statements , in which the second applicant justified the physical destruction of NORP nationals , spoke for themselves . According to the court , the same objective was reflected in a statement made by the second applicant at an event held on DATE , during which he said :", "\u201c For us , GPE is a State of aggression . A State of violence , a State of attack . That is why we are not prepared to accept this ORG , to make peace with this NORP entity . This State was built upon the blood of NORP , through aggression , through violence and we have a duty as NORP to liberate the land again . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the denial of GPE \u2019s right to exist , linked to the call to eliminate the ORG by force , was also the subject matter of several of the first applicant \u2019s flyers . The court quoted , inter alia , a flyer dated DATE , which read :", "\u201c The whole of GPE , from the sea to the river , is NORP territory . NORP are duty bound to liberate it from the rule of the NORP , even if it costs the lives of CARDINAL of martyrs . \u201d", "Another flyer dated DATE contained the following :", "\u201c The NORP question is not a question of withdrawing from the region called the NORP territories . Nor is it a question of the withdrawal from GPE , GPE or from GPE . It is the NORP entity itself which unlawfully appropriated GPE . The solution is to uproot the NORP entity from the entire NORP territory . Thus speaks Allah : \u201c And slay them wherever ye catch them , and turn them out from where they have turned you out\u201d ... CARDINAL ) . Every recognition , every negotiation with the NORP is treason against Allah , His PERSON and the believers . We are not allowed to accept this or to keep quiet about it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court considered that the prohibition was proportionate . In this connection , it observed that the first applicant did not enjoy special protection under the LAW as a religious or philosophical community . It further considered that ORG did not have a milder means at their disposition to achieve the pursued aim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant submitted its comments on the court order . It alleged , in particular , that the court \u2019s interpretation of the notion \u201c religious community \u201d had been too restrictive and was not consistent with the case law of ORG . It further requested an oral hearing to be held .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE , which was served on the applicants\u2019 counsel on DATE , ORG , following a hearing , rejected the application as unfounded . At the outset , the court confirmed its ruling that the applicant could not be regarded as a religious community , as its aims were primarily of a political nature , even if they were based on religious foundations .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that , even assuming that the first applicant could be regarded as a religious community or a religious association ( religi\u00f6ser ORG ) , it remained subject to prohibition under LAW . The court was satisfied that the conditions for a ban to be issued were fulfilled because a multitude of public statements attributable to the first applicant against the backdrop of the NORP - Palestinian conflict called for the violent elimination of the ORG of GPE and for people to be killed .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the first applicant \u2019s objections against this ruling were not convincing . The evidence presented in the court order was sufficient to justify the assumption that the cited articles were attributable to the first applicant . Irrespective of this fact , the first applicant \u2019s calls for ORG to be eliminated by force and for people to be killed were not only restricted to the magazine \u201c LOC .", "CARDINAL . The court lastly found that , having regard to the seriousness of the statements attributable to the first applicant , the measure taken had to be regarded as proportionate even if the first applicant did enjoy the right to religious freedom . It would , in particular , not have been sufficient exclusively to ban the second applicant \u2019s activity , as the impugned statements were not only made by the second applicant . Neither would it have been sufficient to ban the first applicant from issuing statements on LOC conflict , as the first applicant regarded it as a primary duty to combat and violently to destroy GPE . As was demonstrated by the multitude of statements examined by the court in its court order , and had been confirmed by the first applicant during the oral hearing , the first applicant considered it as a main duty of the Caliphate to be created to destroy GPE . These statements had such a weight that even the protection , which religious and philosophical associations generally enjoyed under LAW , did not call for renouncing the prohibition for the mere reason that the statements had so far not been followed by actions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged a constitutional complaint , alleging , in particular , that the prohibition was disproportionate and violated its right freely to assemble as a religious community ( religi\u00f6se PERSON ) under LAW . The first applicant complained , in particular , that LAW was not applicable in the instant case . Furthermore , the prohibition order failed sufficiently to take into account its interests as a religious community and was disproportionate . According to the first applicant , it would have been sufficient to order the second applicant or other members of the association to refrain from making political statements on LOC conflict . The first applicant further alleged that the impugned decisions violated its rights under Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit the first applicant \u2019s complaint for adjudication . According to that court , the complaint was inadmissible because the first applicant was not qualified to file a complaint as it did not have a registered address in GPE . Pursuant to the relevant provisions of the PERSON on proceedings before ORG , only those persons who could claim a violation of their constitutional rights were entitled to lodge a constitutional complaint . LAW of LAW provided that the basic rights also applied to domestic legal persons to the extent that the nature of such rights permitted . The applicant , however , was a foreign legal person . While it might be considered that a foreign legal person based in another member ORG of ORG had a right to equal treatment under LAW , this did not apply in the first applicant \u2019s case , as it had not been established that the first applicant had a registered office in another ORG member ORG .", "CARDINAL . This decision was served on the first applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the German Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ) read as follows :", "Article CARDINAL", "[ Personal freedoms ]", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Every person shall have the right to free development of his personality insofar as he does not violate the rights of others or offend against the constitutional order or the moral law . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "[ Freedom of faith and conscience ]", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Freedom of faith and of conscience , and freedom to profess a religious or philosophical creed , shall be inviolable .", "( CARDINAL ) The undisturbed practice of religion shall be guaranteed .", "... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "[ Freedom of association ]", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) NORP shall have the right to form corporations and other associations .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG whose aims or activities contravene the criminal laws , or that are directed against the constitutional order or the concept of international understanding , shall be prohibited .", "... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "[ Restriction of basic rights \u2013 Legal remedies ]", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Insofar as , under LAW , a basic right may be restricted by or pursuant to a law , such law must apply generally and not merely to a single case .
