On DATE the applicant complained about the events of CARDINAL DATE to the prosecutor \u2019s office of GPE - GPE . The latter referred his complaints to the prosecutor \u2019s office of LOC and to the prosecutor \u2019s office of LOC for inquiry , in letters of CARDINAL DATE respectively . The latter prosecutor \u2019s office further transmitted the applicant \u2019s complaint to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the applicant \u2019s allegations . The decision stated that according to the applicant , at TIME on DATE he received a phone call from a former colleague at the police station , PERSON , who told him that another former colleague from the same police station , Officer PERSON , had some problems . PERSON asked the applicant to call Officer PERSON The applicant called Officer PERSON The latter said that he had problems and asked the applicant to join him in Officer PERSON \u2019s car , parked outside the applicant \u2019s house , to go to LOC . Officer PERSON also asked the applicant to take his passport with him . The applicant went outside and joined Officer PERSON and another man in camouflage uniform in a silver grey ORG car . The applicant sat in the back seat and they drove off . As they were driving , Officer PERSON told the applicant that when he started his duty shift he had signed an entry in the register confirming that he had been issued with a sub - machine gun , but this had not actually been the case , as the gun had not been found . Officer PERSON asked the applicant to go with him to GPE until everything had \u201c cleared up \u201d . Then Officer PERSON and the other man began contending that it was the applicant who had taken the sub - machine gun , because on DATE the sub - machine gun had gone missing he had been at the police station ; this was recorded on ORG . The applicant protested against these allegations , and the man in the camouflage uniform started beating him , while Officer PERSON pretended to try to separate them . Then they drove to the town centre , stopped at the police station , and the man in the camouflage uniform left . Soon Officer PERSON , the deputy head of criminal investigations and the applicant \u2019s former colleague , came out of the police station . The applicant expressed indignation about the police ORG allegations and assault . Officer PERSON replied that he did not suspect the applicant , but asked him to help them if he could . The applicant said that he could not help them . Then Officer PERSON left and Officer PERSON came out of the police station and told the applicant that Mr PERSON , the applicant \u2019s cousin , would soon arrive . Mr PERSON arrived shortly afterwards , accompanied by officers of the police special unit ( ORG ) and asked the applicant to help Officer PERSON because he was a close friend . The applicant responded that there were no grounds to suspect him and that he did not wish to continue this conversation . Officer PERSON then said that they had a video recording , and the applicant asked to see it . They went together to the office of the head of criminal investigations on the second floor of the police station , where Officer PERSON showed the applicant a recording of him entering and leaving the police station . The applicant explained that during his entire visit to the police station he had been accompanied by police officers . After they left that office Officer PERSON , Mr PERSON , and another man , X. , whom the applicant did not know , took him to Officer PERSON \u2019s office , where Mr PERSON again urged him to confess to stealing the sub - machine gun . Then they took him to a different office , where Officers PERSON , NORP , ORG . and X. handcuffed him to a chair , taped his mouth , put wires against his ears and passed electric current through them . The applicant fell off the chair several times but they put him back and sent the current through the wires to his ears again . He managed to get rid of the tape and spit out the blood that had collected in his mouth . Officer PERSON started yelling at him , saying that he would receive no pity as the \u201c minister \u201d had personally ordered that he should be \u201c locked up \u201d . The applicant then realised that he would not be able to endure the torture and offered to confess in writing that he had thrown the sub - machine gun into the river . However , they were unhappy with this suggestion . Then they took him to Officer PERSON \u2019s office , where he and Officers NORP and X. remained until TIME on DATE , when they let him go .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision further quoted forensic report no . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and statements by police officers . In particular , Officer PERSON . stated that he knew the applicant , as he had worked at the police station until DATE . On DATE they had realised that a sub - machine gun was missing . Officer M. had seen it last when he was on duty ; he was subsequently dismissed from the police for its loss . When they tried to establish what had happened , they watched the ORG records since DATE , this being the likely date of the sub - machine gun \u2019s disappearance . The recording showed the applicant entering the police station ; in the film of him leaving he seemed to be holding an unidentified object under his jacket . As the applicant often visited the police station and went into its offices , including the office from which the sub - machine gun might have gone missing , it was decided to invite the applicant , show the recording to him , and ask him to return the weapon . Officer PERSON , a relative of the applicant , was instructed to invite him . On the date in question Officer PERSON . saw Officer PERSON and the applicant in the police station . The applicant did not have any visible injuries , seemed to be in a good mood and asked him how he was doing . TIME he saw the applicant leaving the police station . Neither he nor any other police officers applied physical force to the applicant . However , Officer PERSON . still suspected the applicant of stealing the sub - machine gun and believed that his allegations were an attempt to undermine any possible prosecution for the theft of the weapon . Officer PERSON . believed that the applicant had caused the injuries stated in forensic report no . CARDINAL himself , in order to corroborate his submissions .", "CARDINAL . Officer PERSON stated that he was a distant relative of the applicant . He then corroborated Officer PERSON . \u2019s statement concerning the loss of the sub - machine gun , and added that with the help of PERSON he had contacted the applicant and arranged a meeting with him near his home . Officer PERSON went there by car alone and , when the applicant joined him , explained the situation to him and asked him to return the sub - machine gun , as otherwise Officer PERSON and his colleagues would have a lot of problems . The applicant denied being involved in the theft of the weapon , and agreed to go to the police station . On arrival they met Officer PERSON , who also suggested that the applicant return the sub - machine gun . The applicant reiterated that he had nothing to do with its loss . Then Officer PERSON took him to the office of the head of criminal investigations and left him there with Officer PERSON In TIME he saw the applicant leaving the police station ; he was sitting on a bench nearby with Officer PERSON . He had not seen the applicant since . From Officer PERSON he knew that the latter had shown the applicant the video recording and had asked him to return the sub - machine gun , but nobody had used physical force against him .

He did not know where the applicant had gone afterwards but he saw no injuries on him . Officer PERSON did not know how the applicant had sustained the injuries described in forensic report no . CARDINAL , as no one in the police station had either ill - treated or insulted him .

He had not spoken to the applicant and had only seen him from a distance . Officer NORP had then gone home . He did not know how the applicant could have sustained the injuries stated in forensic report no . CARDINAL , as neither Officer NORP nor other police officers had ill - treated him .", "CARDINAL . Officer PERSON corroborated the statements of Officers PERSON . , PERSON , PERSON and NORP concerning the disappearance of the sub - machine gun , and added that on DATE in question , when he left the police station , he had seen the applicant and Officer PERSON nearby . They were talking peaceably and he did not see any injuries on the applicant \u2019s head or body . Officer PERSON approached them and told the applicant that there were grounds to believe that he had stolen the sub - machine gun and that he must return it .

Officer PERSON had not seen the applicant since , and believed that his allegations were an attempt to avoid prosecution for the theft of the weapon .", "CARDINAL . The decision concluded that , as a result of the inquiry conducted , the applicant \u2019s allegations were not corroborated , and it was doubtful whether he had received the injuries described in forensic report no .

Officer PERSON stated that after the official weapon had gone missing from the police station it had appeared possible that the applicant had been involved in its theft , as he had been recorded leaving the police station with his arm pressed against his body . When the applicant was asked why he had held his arm in such a way he responded that that was how he walked . However , it was clear to Officer PERSON that he was lying .
