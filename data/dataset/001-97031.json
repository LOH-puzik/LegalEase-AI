The applicant had doubts as to whether that investment had in fact been made . He also referred to another investment project , the sanitary sewage system , saying :", "\u201c It is unclear how many metres have been built . It is important , because this is public money . Everyone knows how to spend his own money , but where public money is concerned , it is being spent as much as possible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant further compared the GPE municipality with the neighbouring ORG municipality , which had had a small budget but had managed to construct an interceptor sewer at much less expense , which was an example of rational public spending ( gospodarno\u015b\u0107 ) , and said :", "\u201c And this is shocking ; with contractors earning MONEY , is this not money laundering in our municipality ? \u201d", "CARDINAL .
