THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The first applicant is a stateless person of NORP origin . He was born in GPE in DATE . The second applicant is his mother . She is a naturalised NORP national of NORP origin and was born in GPE in DATE . The applicants , who are currently both residing in the GPE , are represented before the ORG by Ms L. GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agents , Mr R.A.A. PERSON and PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "After the death of the first applicant \u2019s father , who was active for ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) in GPE , the second applicant married PERSON , the brother of her husband . DATE , the latter was detained by the NORP authorities because of his ORG activities . After his release , he was accused by the ORG of espionage for GPE . In DATE , PERSON and his family , consisting of the CARDINAL applicants and a baby born in the meantime , left GPE for GPE , where they applied for asylum .", "After having stayed in GPE and subsequently GPE , the family moved to the GPE where , on DATE , the second applicant ( also on behalf of her children ) and her husband applied for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . On DATE , the ORG Secretary of ORG rejected these requests . The objection filed by the couple was rejected by the ORG Secretary on DATE . On DATE , the second applicant and her husband filed an appeal against the decision of DATE with ORG ( Afdeling Rechtspraak ) of ORG .", "During their stay in the GPE , in the course of which CARDINAL more children were born to the couple , serious tensions arose between the first applicant and his stepfather . In the latter \u2019s opinion , the first applicant misbehaved by , inter alia , playing truant and having undesirable friends . He felt that he had no longer any authority over the first applicant . After the first applicant had broken into his school where he committed acts of vandalism , his stepfather decided to send him temporarily back to GPE . The second applicant thought that the first applicant would only go to GPE for a short period in order to become acquainted with his native country and culture . On DATE , without having been granted a re - entry visa ( terugkeervisum ) the first applicant travelled to GPE , where he moved in with his maternal grandmother in a refugee camp in ORG . The first applicant \u2019s school and the GPE immigration authorities were informed of this fact .", "On DATE , pending the appeal proceedings before ORG , and in accordance with NORP policy in asylum cases that have not been dealt with within a certain time span , the ORG Secretary informed the second applicant and her husband that the objections against their residence in the GPE had been withdrawn and that instructions had been issued to provide them and the second applicant \u2019s minor children with a residence permit . The second applicant and her husband subsequently withdrew their appeal pending before ORG .", "On DATE , the second applicant reapplied for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . This permit , also valid for her minor children living with her , was granted on DATE .", "On an unspecified date the second applicant and her husband filed a petition for naturalisation . In this petition , they further requested the conaturalisation ( medenaturalisatie ) of their CARDINAL minor children . This request did not include the first applicant . By LAW ) of DATE , the second applicant , her husband and their CARDINAL children were granted NORP citizenship .", "Wishing to return to the GPE , the first applicant requested the GPE authorities in GPE on DATE for a temporary residence permit ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) on grounds of family reunification .", "On DATE , as his visa application remained undetermined , the first applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) with the Minister of ORG ( Minister PERSON ) against the implied refusal ( fictieve weigering ) to grant him a temporary residence permit .", "On DATE , the first applicant further requested the President of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) to issue an interim measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) ordering the Minister of ORG to issue a temporary residence permit or a laissez - passer allowing him to travel to the GPE together with the second applicant , who at that time was visiting him in GPE .", "On DATE ORG set a deadline of DATE for ORG ( ORG ) of ORG to determine the first applicant \u2019s request for a visa .", "On DATE , in the context of the objection filed on DATE , the second applicant was heard by a commission of ORG ( Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst ) concerning the first applicant \u2019s request to enter the GPE . At that hearing , she declared inter alia that the first applicant had been sent to GPE after family tensions had arisen in the GPE because of the first applicant \u2019s westernisation . It was thought desirable that he learn his language and culture and become acquainted with his family living in GPE .", "In an undated decision taken on or around DATE , the Minister of ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s objection of DATE . On DATE , the first applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG . He further requested the President of ORG to issue an interim measure allowing him to travel to the GPE .", "On DATE , the President of ORG rejected the request for an interim measure . The President did not find it established that the first applicant \u2019s situation was of such gravity that he should be allowed to enter the GPE as a matter of urgency .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG declared the first applicant \u2019s appeal of CARDINAL DATE partly founded . Although ORG agreed with the Minister of ORG that , under the GPE immigration rules , the first applicant did not qualify for a temporary residence permit on grounds of family reunification , it held , as to the first applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW , that the preparation of the decision taken by ORG had been negligent and that this decision lacked sufficient reasoning . It was found that the Minister had failed to examine the question of the Netherlands\u2019 positive obligations under LAW in a satisfactory manner , in that a number of important elements had not , or not sufficiently , been taken into account . Consequently , it quashed the impugned decision and ordered the Minister of ORG to take a new decision .", "As none was taken within the prescribed statutory delay of DATE , the first applicant filed an appeal on DATE with ORG against this failure and requested accelerated proceedings ( versnelde behandeling ) .", "In the course of the hearing held on DATE , the first applicant further requested the President of ORG to issue an interim measure allowing him to travel to the GPE . In its decision of DATE , ORG ordered the Minister of ORG to determine the first applicant \u2019s objection of DATE within DATE . It rejected the applicant \u2019s other claims .", "On DATE , the first applicant again appealed to ORG as no fresh decision had been taken within the set time - limit and requested accelerated proceedings .", "In its decision of DATE , ORG noted that no new decision had been taken by the Minister of ORG . It further noted that , on DATE , the second applicant had been heard by a commission of ORG but apparently this hearing did not result in a determination of the first applicant \u2019s objection . In the absence of a new decision on the merits of the objection , ORG could only find that the Minister of ORG had again failed to determine the objection timely . Consequently , it declared the first applicant \u2019s appeal founded and ordered the Minister to determine the first applicant \u2019s objection within DATE .", "On DATE the Minister of ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s objection of DATE . The Minister recalled that , in its decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG had accepted that the first applicant did not qualify for a residence permit on grounds of family reunification under the relevant domestic immigration rules . Insofar as the first applicant relied on LAW , the Minister accepted that there was family life between the first applicant and his family living in the GPE , but did not find that there were such facts or circumstances which might give rise to a positive obligation on the Government to grant the first applicant a residence permit . On this point the Minister considered that the fact that the first applicant \u2019s family had lived in the GPE since DATE and held the GPE nationality did not in itself create such an obligation .", "Further noting that the choice to return the first applicant to GPE for DATE had apparently been a conscious one , the Minister considered that the applicants should have realised that this choice entailed a risk that the first applicant would not be readmitted to the GPE . Having noted , inter alia , that the second applicant had visited the first applicant several times in GPE , the Minister did not find it established that there were any objective obstacles to the exercise of the applicants\u2019 family life in GPE . As to the fact that the first applicant \u2019s siblings held the GPE nationality and were attending school in the GPE , the Minister held that this was a subjective rather than an objective obstacle for the exercise of family life elsewhere . Finally , noting that the first applicant had attained DATE in the meantime , and that , as from a young age , he had taken independent decisions , including the termination of his schooling and his relocation within GPE , the Minister held that the first applicant could be regarded as being quite capable of maintaining himself , and concluded that the general interests of the GPE in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy outweighed the applicants\u2019 interests .", "The first applicant filed an appeal with ORG , before which a hearing was held on DATE .", "In its decision of DATE , ORG rejected the appeal . It accepted the finding of the Minister that it had not been established that , on the basis of his personal circumstances , the applicant could not be expected to remain in GPE and should be admitted to the GPE on humanitarian grounds . It did not find it established that the first applicant was in fact wanted by ORG and for that reason was continuously forced into hiding , as he had alleged . Noting that the first applicant was housed and financially supported by his uncle , that other members of his family are living in GPE and that the second applicant could continue to provide him with support , ORG concluded that the finding of the Minister could not be regarded as unjust .", "As to the argument raised under LAW , ORG concluded that , in the light of its findings as to the first applicant \u2019s personal situation , the interests of ORG in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy outweighed the applicants\u2019 interests in exercising their family life in the GPE . ORG did not find it established that there were any objective obstacles preventing the applicants from enjoying their family life in GPE . It noted on this point that the asylum request of the first applicant \u2019s stepfather had been rejected but that he had subsequently obtained a residence permit because of a special policy allowing asylum seekers to remain when asylum proceedings had lasted DATE . ORG further rejected the argument that the ORG integration into NORP society should be regarded as an objective obstacle to the whole family \u2019s return to GPE .", "On DATE , the first applicant travelled on a false passport via GPE to GPE intending to continue to the GPE . He was arrested in GPE and placed in GPE detention .", "He subsequently applied for asylum in GPE . On DATE , via his lawyer in the GPE , the first applicant requested the GPE authorities to take over his asylum request from GPE . On DATE , the first applicant \u2019s lawyer further filed a new request for a temporary residence permit for the first applicant .", "After the NORP authorities had rejected the first applicant \u2019s request for asylum , he was expelled to GPE on DATE .", "Upon his arrival in GPE , the first applicant was detained as he held no documents allowing him to stay in GPE . The NORP authorities allowed him to telephone the second applicant . On DATE , the first applicant DATE via his lawyer in the GPE \u2013 informed the GPE authorities of his situation , requesting them to intervene and allow him to travel to the GPE . After the second applicant had sent money to GPE , the first applicant was released on DATE and was told to leave GPE within DATE . On DATE , the first applicant travelled to the GPE , where he has resided since .", "On DATE , the Minister of ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s application of DATE for a temporary residence permit , finding that such a permit can not be granted when the person concerned has already entered the GPE . The first applicant \u2019s objection to this decision , in which he only argued that he should be regarded as exempted from the obligation to have a temporary residence permit and did not raise any arguments concerning the reasons for the rejection of DATE , was dismissed by the Minister of ORG on DATE . Although an appeal against this decision could be filed with ORG , it does not appear that the first applicant availed himself of this possibility .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the first applicant \u2019s lawyer requested ORG to declare that , on the basis of LAW of DATE and at that time being a minor son of the second applicant , the first applicant is a NORP national .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s request . It noted that the first applicant had already left for GPE when his mother , stepfather and their children were granted a NORP residence permit and that , subsequently , the second applicant and her husband were granted NORP nationality , it being stipulated that NORP nationality was withheld from minor children who did not hold a NORP residence permit . On this point ORG also noted that the request for naturalisation , resulting in LAW of DATE , had not included the first applicant . It therefore concluded that no misunderstanding could have arisen about the first applicant \u2019s exclusion from the naturalisation decision . It further rejected as unestablished the first applicant \u2019s argument that , in departing for GPE , he had not intended to alter his principal place of residence ( hoofdverblijf ) in the GPE or to sever his family tie . On this point ORG noted that , at the time of naturalisation , the first applicant had already resided for DATE in GPE with different relatives . In addition , ORG took into account the reasons for his return to GPE given by the second applicant before the commission of ORG , namely family tensions caused by his westernisation , and the need for him to learn the language and the culture , and to become acquainted with his family in GPE .", "The admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated at the material time by LAW DATE ( PERSON ) , the Regulation on Aliens ( ORG ) and LAW ( Vreemdelingencirculaire ; \u201c LAW \u201d ) , being directives drawn up and published by ORG .", "On DATE , LAW entered into force \u2013 replacing LAW \u2013 along with a new Regulation on Aliens and new Guidelines .", "The GPE authorities pursue a restrictive immigration policy in view of the high population density in the GPE and the problems to which this gives rise . In general and under the legal rules in force until DATE , aliens are only granted admission for residence purposes if : ( a ) the GPE are obliged under international law to do so ; ( b ) this serves the \u201c essential interests of the GPE \u201d , e.g. economic or cultural interests ; and ( c ) there are \u201c cogent reasons of a humanitarian nature \u201d ( LAW ACARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL of the Guidelines ) . No right to admission to the GPE can be derived from the fact that a non - NORP national is living there without a residence permit .", "An alien wishing to enter and stay in the GPE for DATE must have a temporary residence permit . An application for such a permit can be made to the GPE authorities in the alien \u2019s country of origin . The resident in the GPE with whom an alien seeking admission is planning to stay , can also apply to the chief of the local police for an official opinion . An application for a temporary residence permit is determined on the basis of the same requirements as a residence permit . These requirements differ depending on the grounds on which an alien seeks admission and residence .", "The policy for admission for family reunification purposes was at the relevant time laid down in LAW of FAC . This provides , insofar as relevant , that a residence permit for the purposes of family reunification may be granted in respect of minor children of a NORP national when , inter alia , the children factually belong to his / her family and the family ties with the parent already existed abroad and have been maintained . Family ties are considered to have been severed by the longterm integration of the child into another family when the parents no longer exercise parental authority and no longer provide for the costs of the upbringing and care of the child .", "Aliens who are allowed to remain in the GPE pending a decision on their residence status may under certain conditions , with the consent of the NORP authorities , return to their countries of origin for short periods . If they meet the requirements , being at least compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature , such as a serious illness or the death of close relatives , they may be granted a re - entry visa , which affirms the right of the holder to return to the GPE . No re - entry visas for a temporary return to their country of origin are granted to asylum seekers ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
