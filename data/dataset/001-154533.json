De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instituted insolvency proceedings against the company S. , at that time the applicant \u2019s employer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the receiver in insolvency issued a decision on the termination of the applicant \u2019s employment contract with the company S.", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date , the applicant lodged his claim for a redundancy payment in the insolvency proceedings . Since the receiver disputed the claim , ORG on DATE referred the applicant to labour proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the same period CARDINAL claims similar to that of the applicant were lodged before the same court .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG issued decisions in CARDINAL cases similar to the applicant \u2019s , dismissing the claims . It held that the workers who had lost their jobs owing to the employer \u2019s insolvency before section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) became effective were not entitled to a redundancy payment . Section DATE explicitly foresaw a right to a redundancy payment for workers who were let go after a company had become insolvent .", "CARDINAL . In DATE several applications for a constitutional review of section DATE Act were lodged with ORG , challenging the constitutionality of non - retroactive application of that provision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the negative decisions issued in the CARDINAL cases ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the trade union which was also representing the applicant requested the court to postpone hearings scheduled in other cases . The union wanted to first check whether the other workers wanted to withdraw their claims in order to avoid the costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . No formal decision on adjourning or staying the proceedings was issued by the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the motions for review of the constitutionality of section CARDINAL of LAW . It held that they were unfounded , since they were based on the false premises that the right to a redundancy payment for workers laid off because of their employer \u2019s insolvency was introduced only by section DATE , and that moreover it did not apply retroactively . Referring to its own decisions issued in DATE , it stressed that this right had already been foreseen by the general labour legislation in force prior to the adoption of the CARDINAL Act . It explained that the purpose of LAW was solely to explicitly clarify that also workers who lost their jobs because of the insolvency of their employers were entitled to redundancy payments . Such clarification was needed because of the conflicting case - law of the lower courts . In this respect the Constitutional Court emphasised that while it could not interfere with the correct interpretation of legal norms by the lower courts , the latter could not apply an interpretation which would be unconstitutional , arbitrary , or clearly wrong .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the parties settled with the company S. , which acknowledged the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a claim for compensation for damage sustained because of the length of the labour proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his claim . It held that LAW of the Right to a Trial without Undue Delay ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) was not applicable , since that provision only applied to cases where an individual had already lodged an application on account of length of proceedings before an international court . Applying the general rules of LAW on pecuniary damages , it further concluded that since the case had been settled the applicant had failed to prove that he had incurred any damage . In any case , there was also no causal link between the conduct of the court and the damage allegedly sustained . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s appeal and remitted the case back to the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in a renewed set of proceedings , again dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It concluded that he had failed to prove either any damage on account of delays in the proceedings or any causal link . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The applicant lodged a constitutional appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal by referring to its decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and remitted the case to the higher court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG remitted the case back to the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , applying by analogy , in accordance with the instructions of ORG , the provisions of LAW , dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . Referring to the case - law of ORG , it held that it had been reasonable to suspend the examination of the applicant \u2019s claim pending the outcome of some similar cases and of the proceedings before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It held that it could not identify any unreasonable delays in these similar cases , which took DATE at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction , of which DATE were before ORG . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The applicant lodged an application for leave to appeal on points of law and a constitutional appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL .
