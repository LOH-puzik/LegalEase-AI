On DATE the PERSON rejected the criminal complaint on the ground that there was no reasonable suspicion that the suspects had committed the alleged crime . The applicant \u2019s husband was notified accordingly and informed that he could pursue a subsidiary criminal prosecution ( preuzeti krivi\u010dno gonjenje ) within DATE of the date that decision had been served on him by filing a request for an investigation ( zahtev za sprovo\u0111enje istrage ) .", "CARDINAL .

In the complaint they expressed their doubt that Mr PERSON had jumped out of the office window of his own volition and their suspicion that the suspects had thrown their son \u2019s corpse out of the window in order to conceal previous ill - treatment .

On DATE the ORG in GPE rejected that criminal complaint for the same reasons relied on in its decision of DATE , and repeated the information it had provided about the possibility of a subsidiary prosecution .

NORP In response to a request of CARDINAL DATE by ORG investigating judge , ORG , as well as a reminder sent on DATE , on DATE CARDINAL forensic pathologists , PERSON and PERSON , from ORG in GPE provided an expert opinion . Relying on the previous medical and autopsy reports , they found that the location , distribution and types of injuries observed on Mr PERSON indicated that they were severe and life - endangering , and that they could undoubtedly have been the result of a fall from the second floor , but only through an open window . In particular , they found that taking into account the circumstances of the incident , including Mr PERSON build , his DATE clothes and his handcuffs , the size of the window pane in question and the position of the furniture and the window in the office , it would have been practically impossible for him to have broken through the window and jumped out . Otherwise , it would mean that he had been able to \u201c fly horizontally \u201d over the armchair and break the window with his head exactly in its centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge held a hearing and interviewed the suspects . They repeated their earlier statements . PERSON added that Mr PERSON had jumped from the floor QUANTITY away from the window and gone through it without touching the armchair , which was under the window ; none of the furniture had fallen over or been moved .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant was instructed that she could appeal against that decision within DATE from the date on which the decision was served on her and she did so on DATE , reiterating her previous arguments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal as unfounded . In reaching that decision , by reference to the expert commission \u2019s forensic findings of DATE , it upheld the lower court \u2019s reasoning as clear , conclusive and convincing . That decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( inicijativa za podizanje zahteva za za\u0161titu zakonitosti ) , urging him to lodge a request with ORG for the protection of legality ( zahtev za za\u0161titu zakonitosti ) against the decision of DATE on her behalf .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief Public Prosecutor informed the applicant that on that same day he had accepted her motion and had lodged a request for the protection of legality against the decision of DATE , submitting , in particular , that : ( a ) the court had based its finding on evidence that had been challenged by the applicant and , which , according to him , had been flawed by inconsistencies ; ( b ) the court had dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeals without addressing her arguments ; and ( c ) the collection and examination of evidence had been superficial , which had resulted in the incorrect and implausible conclusion reached by the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in a different composition from that of DATE , rejected the ORG \u2019s request . Having regard to the case file and a hearing in the presence of the CARDINAL suspects and their lawyer , the court stated the following : ( a ) the forensic experts had not ruled out that the victim might have sustained the injuries while breaking the window and falling on a hard surface ; ( b ) no evidence had shown that the suspects had caused the victim any bodily harm by any other means ; ( c ) according to the relevant evidence , there was no reasonable suspicion that the suspects had committed the alleged crimes which would warrant the opening of criminal proceedings ; and , lastly , ( d ) the impugned decision did not ultimately preclude the opening of criminal proceedings if the victim , as a subsidiary prosecutor , submitted new evidence which had not existed or had been unknown at the time of her previous request for an investigation . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant and her husband brought a joint civil action against the respondent ORG and ORG to obtain redress for the mental anguish suffered as a consequence of Mr PERSON death . They relied on LAW and various international human rights instruments . The defendant contested the claim in general , but did not make any further clarification in that respect .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG clarified that although it could not ascertain a reliable course of the events in question or anyone \u2019s clear fault , this was not its task in any event . Referring to the DATE forensic experts\u2019 report and LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below , respectively ) , the court concluded that the respondent ORG should compensate the plaintiffs on the basis of the ORG \u2019s liability for its officials\u2019 omissions , which had undoubtedly occurred given that Mr PERSON had sustained injuries and died while in police custody under the supervision of ORG officials . Pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , it awarded each plaintiff ORG for non - pecuniary damage , and made an award in respect of costs .", "CARDINAL .
