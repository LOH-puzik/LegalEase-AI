The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Shoumen .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant allegedly took part in a violent incident in a bar in his home town of Shoumen . It seems that the police were alerted about the incident , intervened and questioned some of the participants and the other persons present on the spot , without making arrests .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant allegedly took part in another violent incident in a restaurant in Shoumen . Apparently during this second incident a PERSON was beaten , robbed , abducted and threatened with violence . TIME Mr P.P. complained to the police .", "CARDINAL . NORP In TIME of CARDINAL DATE the applicant went to ORG in Shoumen for questioning in connection with the incidents . At TIME he was questioned as a witness . He submits that during DATE he was kept under arrest in the police department . According to the Government , the applicant was not deprived of his liberty at that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings were opened against the applicant and CARDINAL other persons on suspicion that they had robbed Mr P.P. , had deprived him of his liberty and had coerced him to pay them money .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator ordered the applicant 's preliminary detention for a period of twentyfour TIME , starting to run at TIME on DATE , on suspicion that on DATE he had committed abduction and unlawful deprivation of liberty , contrary to LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The order stated that the applicant had been arrested immediately after having committed the alleged offence , in accordance with LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . Despite the applicant 's insistence to meet the investigator , he was not brought before him at that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor extended the applicant 's preliminary detention for DATE , starting to run from DATE of the extension . The same day the applicant was allowed to meet a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant was brought before an investigator and charged with having instigated others to commit unlawful deprivation of liberty in a manner endangering the health of the victim and also to commit extortion through threats of murder accompanied by light bodily injury . The investigator ordered his pretrial detention . The same day a prosecutor from ORG confirmed the investigator 's decision to detain the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP Immediately after the charging the applicant was questioned in the presence of his counsel . The applicant stated that he understood the charges against him . His counsel asked to be allowed access to the casefile . The investigator allegedly refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted an appeal against his pretrial detention . He claimed that he had not committed the alleged offences and that the accusation against him was not supported by the available evidence .", "CARDINAL . ORG sent the applicant 's appeal to ORG on DATE together with the casefile . It arrived in the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was examined by ORG on DATE in an open hearing in the presence of the applicant and his counsel . Counsel referred to the alleged lack of evidence against the applicant and , in addition , noted that the applicant had a permanent address , a job , and CARDINAL children . Counsel also presented a medical certificate issued by ORG which indicated that the applicant was suffering from myasthenia and post - traumatic encephalopathy , for which he had been hospitalised in DATE , and also from psoriasis . Counsel argued that the latter required better sanitary conditions than those in the cell of ORG where the applicant was being held .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court rejected the appeal . It held that in proceedings against the imposition of detention it could not go into issues relating to the accusation and the evidence against the applicant , as that had to do with the merits of the criminal case against him . The only relevant arguments of the applicant were those pertaining to his health . The court further held that the applicant had failed to prove that he was suffering from psoriasis and that the other diseases indicated by him were neurological and required no particular conditions of treatment . It also briefly noted that the applicant had been detained under LAW CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG and that there were no grounds for releasing him , in view of the impending investigative actions and the ascertaining of the truth .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to release the applicant on bail , reasoning that the applicant 's health had worsened during his stay in custody . In particular , his psoriasis had intensified due to the poor sanitary conditions and the lack of sunlight in his cell . Moreover , the investigation had almost been completed and the applicant had a permanent address and a job , which reduced the chances of him absconding or impeding the investigation .", "The applicant posted bail DATE and was released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant and to drop the charges against him . It reasoned that the accusation against the applicant had not been proven .", "CARDINAL . After he appeared for questioning in TIME of CARDINAL DATE the applicant remained on the LOC of ORG . The following day or DATE after that he was transferred to the detention facility of ORG . He remained there until DATE , when he was released .", "CARDINAL . There the applicant was held in an underground cell with no windows . Its door was made of solid metal , with a small aperture allowing the guards to inspect the cell .

During the time which the applicant spent in the cell it was occupied by CARDINAL detainees .", "CARDINAL . One of the walls of the cell was oozy and covered with mould .", "CARDINAL . The cell was lighted by a single electric bulb situated above the door . Its switch was in the hallway and it allegedly remained on twentyfour TIME a day . According to the applicant , the light coming from the bulb was not sufficient to allow him to read .", "CARDINAL . The detainees were sleeping on a concrete platform which was QUANTITY above the floor level and was covered with wooden planks . The planks were covered only with blankets . There was no bed linen . It seems that the cell contained no other pieces of furniture .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , as well as the other detainees , was allowed to go out of the cell for TIME CARDINAL or CARDINAL times a day \u2013 in the morning and in TIME to wash themselves and to use the toilet . It seems that the detainees could also leave the cell when they wished to write a request to the investigator , the prosecutor or the court . In that case they were allowed to stay in the hallway to write .", "CARDINAL . The size of the toilet room , which was at the other end of the hallway , was QUANTITY and there were CARDINAL ORG toilets in it , with no screens between them and between them and the CARDINAL sinks , with the result that all inmates had to relieve themselves in each other 's presence .", "CARDINAL . The detainees had to use a bucket in the cell to relieve themselves outside the toilet visits . They had to empty the bucket and clean it themselves when leaving the cell to use the sanitary facilities .", "CARDINAL . The toilet was also used as a bathroom . The detainees were allowed to bathe once DATE , for TIME . There was no shower and they had to take hot water from a pail containing QUANTITY , which they mixed with cold water from the tap . The detainees had to pour water over their bodies with the mugs they were using for eating .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the food , which was served in the cell twice a day , was of poor quality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE after his arrest the applicant 's psoriasis aggravated . His skin got covered with massive eczema . He informed the facility 's paramedic about this and asked to have medicines brought from his home . It seems that he had to apply his medication CARDINAL or CARDINAL times a day , but was not allowed to keep it in the cell and could only apply it twice a day , during the toilet visits . The applicant alleges that , as a result , he started to develop psoriatic arthritis : his joints swelled , he started feeling pain in his ankles , and could not move the fingers of his right hand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested to be examined by a dermatologist . His request was granted . During the examination the doctor found that as a result of the bad sanitary conditions in which the applicant was being kept the rashes on his skin had aggravated . The applicant was prescribed injections , which apparently were regularly administered by the detention facility 's paramedic at the door of the applicant 's cell .", "CARDINAL . The ORG visited GPE in DATE and again in DATE and DATE . Although ORG detention facility was not visited on any of these occasions , all reports included general observations about problems in all ORG facilities .", "CARDINAL . In this report ( ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ) the ORG found that most , albeit not all , of the ORG detention facilities were overcrowded . With the exception of CARDINAL detention facility where conditions were better , the conditions were as follows : detainees slept on mattresses on sleeping platforms on the floor ; hygiene was poor and blankets and pillows were dirty ; cells did not have access to natural light , the artificial lighting was too weak to read by and was left on permanently ; ventilation systems were in poor condition ; detainees could use a toilet and washbasin twice a day ( morning and evening ) for TIME and could take a DATE shower ; outside of the CARDINAL daily visits to the toilets , detainees had to satisfy the needs of nature in the cell bucket ; although according to the establishments ' internal regulations detainees were entitled to a \u201c DATE walk \u201d of TIME , it was often reduced to TIME or not allowed at all ; no other form of outofcell activity was provided to persons detained .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further noted that food was of poor quality and in insufficient quantity . In particular , the DATE 's \u201c hot meal \u201d generally consisted of a watery soup ( often lukewarm ) and inadequate quantities of bread . At the other meals , detainees only received bread and a little cheese or khalva . Meat and fruit were rarely included on the menu . Detainees had to eat from bowls without cutlery \u2013 not even a spoon was provided .", "CARDINAL . NORP The ORG also noted that family visits were only possible with permission and that as a result detainees ' contact with the outside world was very limited . There was no radio or television .", "CARDINAL . The ORG concluded that the NORP authorities had failed in their obligation to provide detention conditions which were consistent with the inherent dignity of the human person and that \u201c almost without exception , the conditions in the ORG detention facilities visited could fairly be described as inhuman and degrading . \u201d In reaction , the NORP authorities had agreed that the [ ORG ] delegation 's assessment had been \u201c objective and correctly presented \u201d but had indicated that the options for improvement were limited by the country 's difficult financial circumstances .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the ORG recommended to the NORP authorities , inter alia , that sufficient food and drink and safe eating utensils be provided , that mattresses and blankets be cleaned regularly , that detainees be provided with personal hygiene products ( soap , toothpaste , etc ) , that custodial staff be instructed that detainees should be allowed to leave their cells during DATE for the purpose of using a toilet facility unless overriding security considerations required otherwise , that the regulation providing for TIME exercise per day be fully respected in practice , that cell lighting and ventilation be improved , that the regime of family visits be revised and that pretrial detainees should be more often transferred to prison even before the preliminary investigation was completed . The possibility of offering detainees outdoor exercise was to be examined as a matter of urgency .", "CARDINAL . In this report ( ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) the ORG noted that new rules , providing for better conditions , had been enacted but had not yet resulted in significant improvements .", "CARDINAL . In most places visited in DATE ( with the exception of a newly opened detention facility in GPE ) , the conditions of detention in ORG premises had remained generally the same as those observed during the ORG 's DATE visit , including as regards hygiene , overcrowding and outofcell activities . In some places the situation had even deteriorated .", "CARDINAL . In this report ( ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) the ORG noted that most ORG detention facilities were undergoing renovation but that a lot remained to be done . The cells remained generally overcrowded .", "CARDINAL . Despite the ORG 's recommendations in the report on their DATE visit , no proper regime of activities had been developed for detainees spending long periods in the investigation detention facilities . Those facilities did not have areas for outdoor exercise . At some of the establishments ( e.g. Botevgrad ) , attempts were being made to compensate for the lack of outdoor exercise facilities by allowing detainees to stroll in the corridor several times a day . The ORG stated that \u201c in this respect , the situation remain[ed ] of serious concern \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG provides that the offences of abduction and false imprisonment carry a penalty of DATE ten years ' imprisonment .", "CARDINAL .
