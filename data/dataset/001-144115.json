The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant suffered an incapacitating stroke in DATE which left her with severely limited mobility . In DATE she fell heavily , breaking her hip in several places . She then suffered CARDINAL further falls , both of which resulted in further hospitalisation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has a small and neurogenic bladder . As a result , she usually has to urinate CARDINAL times a night . On account of her mobility problems she is unable safely to access a toilet or commode unaided .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , after the applicant \u2019s third fall , she applied to ORG ( \u201c ILF \u201d ) for DATE and night support . While the application was pending she was provided with a care package by the local authority ( GPE of GPE and ORG ) which included TIME per week of night - time care . The application to the PERSON was ultimately unsuccessful as the applicant ceased to be eligible for funding when she turned CARDINAL in DATE .", "CARDINAL . A local authority care plan dated DATE indicated that the applicant needed \u201c assistance with toileting , when it \u2019s required during the night \u201d . Likewise , the FACE ( Functional Analysis of Care Environments ) Overview assessment which followed on DATE noted that \u201c Miss ORG needs assistance to manage continence at TIME . Substantial need . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the FACE Overview Assessment was subsequently amended to read \u201c Miss PERSON needs assistance at TIME to use the commode . Moderate need . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A further Needs Assessment was started on DATE and signed off on DATE . It noted :", "\u201c PERSON wanted to emphasise that she requires assistance with all transfers and when she mobilises . PERSON requested TIME care in order [ for ] someone to assist her using commode during TIME . This is because PERSON does not wish to use incontinence pads and sheets ...", "Summary of Needs Assessment", "PERSON needs assistance to use the commode at TIME . Substantial need . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A further Needs Assessment signed off on DATE concluded that \u201c Miss PERSON needs assistance to use the commode at TIME . Substantial need . \u201d This assessment was subsequently described by Lord PERSON as \u201c a concession \u201d granted on a \u201c temporary basis \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the opinion of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a formal decision was taken to reduce the amount allocated for the applicant \u2019s DATE care from GBP CARDINAL to GBP CARDINAL . This figure appears to have been assessed on the basis that the applicant would be provided with incontinence pads in lieu of TIME - time care . This decision was taken at a meeting between the local authority and the applicant at the applicant \u2019s home . She was formally notified of the decision by letter dated DATE . It noted that :", "\u201c As stated at the meeting , the rationale behind the planned reduction is that we consider the current provision to be in excess of that required to meet your eligible needs under the council \u2019s ORG criteria . The council has a duty to provide care , but we must do so in a way that shows regard for use of public resources . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought permission to apply for judicial review on the ground that the local authority was unreasonably and unlawfully failing to meet her assessed and eligible needs . She further submitted that the local authorities\u2019 actions would cause her to suffer indignity which would amount to an interference with her right to respect for her private life in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Pending judicial consideration of the applicant \u2019s complaints , a \u201c holding compromise \u201d was reached : from DATE she continued to receive TIME - time care DATE and DATE and DATE she received TIME - time care DATE . During this period the applicant \u2019s partner stayed with her when TIME - time care was n\u2019t provided in order to assist her . In DATE all night - time care was withdrawn .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the application was refused by a Deputy High Court Judge . Although the judge accepted that the local authority was obliged to meet the applicant \u2019s assessed need , she found that the assessed need was not \u201c assistance to use the commode at night \u201d but rather ensuring the applicant \u2019s safety . The judge considered there to be CARDINAL ways to meet that need : the provision of a TIME - time carer or the provision of incontinence pads . The statutory scheme requiring that the applicant \u2019s needs be met allowed the local authority some flexibility about how that was to be done and the local authority was therefore quite entitled to meet the need in the most economic manner . The judge further considered the applicant \u2019s complaints under LAW to be \u201c parasitic \u201d upon the first ground being established and did not , therefore , consider that they raised any issues which needed to be gone into .", "CARDINAL . Following that decision , the local authority carried out a ORG . The review , which was dated DATE , concluded that", "\u201c It remains ORG view that the use of incontinence pads is a practical and appropriate solution to PERSON night - time toileting needs . There does not seem to be any reason why this planned reduction to provide care should not go ahead ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . After a visit to the applicant \u2019s home on DATE , a further ORG was conducted . It was noted that \u201c PERSON did not want to discuss the option of using incontinence pads or PERSON sheets ( absorbent sheets ) as a way of meeting her toileting needs \u201d . The ORG concluded :", "\u201c I remain of the opinion that PERSON need to be kept safe from falling and injuring herself can be met by the provision of equipment ( pads and/or absorbent sheets ) . She has however consistently refused this option . I am aware that she considers pads and/or sheets to be an affront to her dignity . Other service users have held similar views when such measures were initially suggested but once they have tried them , and been provided with support in using them , they have realised that the pads / sheets improve the quality of life by protecting them from harm and allowing a degree of privacy and independence in circumstances which , as the result of health problems , are less than ideal . The practicalities can be managed within the existing care package to accommodate PERSON preferred TIME and to allow her to be bathed in TIME and/or have sheets changed . If PERSON were willing to try this option , she might similarly alter her views .", "... ... ...", "In light of her entrenched position on this , and despite the council \u2019s view that pads and/or sheets are the best way to ensure PERSON safety , consideration has been given to ORG as a means by which PERSON could continue to receive support throughout DATE and night . This would be consistent with her wish to receive personal care and also remain living independently in the community . It is not the recommended option because being assisted to access the toilet at night carries a risk of falls , but has been explored because of the impasse as regards the use of pads . Such accommodation will make support available TIME a day and reduce any longer term need to provide residential care to PERSON should her needs increase in future . PERSON refused this option when it was discussed with her . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG for permission to appeal against the refusal of permission to apply for judicial review on the grounds first , that the reduction in funding was inconsistent with the assessment of her night - time needs ; secondly , that the reduction in funding violated her rights under LAW ; and thirdly , that in reducing her funding the local authority had failed to comply with its obligations under LAW DATE . In particular , she argued that if forced to use incontinence pads she would \u201c lose all sense of dignity \u201d and , as a consequence , she would suffer considerable distress . The local authority submitted that the provision of a night - time carer would cost GBP CARDINAL per year , which would have to be paid out of the adult social care budget from which all other community care services for adults in the applicant \u2019s borough were funded . The local authority also argued that the use of pads would ensure the applicant \u2019s safety and provide her with greater privacy and independence in her own home . Finally , the local authority submitted that the DATE funding of GBP CARDINAL could be used according to the applicant \u2019s preferences . She could therefore pay for a TIME visit for the purpose of fitting the pads , and even a subsequent visit if necessary .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicant \u2019s application for permission to appeal , a single Lord Justice granted permission and directed that the claim for judicial review should be heard by ORG . In a decision dated CARDINAL DATE ORG departed from the judgment of ORG insofar as it did not consider that it was appropriate for the courts to re - categorise the applicant \u2019s needs as assessed by the local authority . It therefore found that DATE ( the date of the disputed decision letter ) and DATE ( the date of its first care plan review ) the applicant \u2019s assessed need had been for assistance to use a commode . In failing to provide such assistance , the local authority had been in breach of its statutory duty . However , it had mitigated the breach by entering into an arrangement with the applicant \u2019s partner . Moreover , the DATE decision had not been put into operation and applicant \u2019s need had been reassessed in ORG of DATE and DATE . As a consequence , the court found that the applicant had no substantive complaint under this head .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the complaint under LAW , ORG found that the conditions for finding a breach had not been established . Even though the local authority had failed in its duty at the time of its DATE decision , the error was not born of any lack of respect for the applicant \u2019s dignity but of a concern to perform the difficult task of balancing its desire to assist the applicant with its responsibilities to all its clients within the limited resources available to it .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court held that there had been no failure to comply with any obligations under LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was granted permission to appeal to ORG . She argued that : ORG had been wrong to hold that the DATE and DATE Care Plan Reviews were to be read as including a reassessment of her needs ; the decision to provide her with incontinence pads instead of a TIME - time carer had unjustifiably interfered with her rights under LAW ; and there had been a failure to comply with LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a majority , ORG agreed with ORG that the applicant \u2019s needs had been reassessed on DATE , as the local authority had been entitled to do ; that , from DATE , there had been no interference with the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW ; and that there had been no failure to comply with LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the complaint under LAW observed that even if a direct link existed between the measures sought by the applicant and her private life , the clear and consistent jurisprudence of ORG established that GPE enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in striking a fair balance between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole . He went on to state that :", "\u201c There is , of course , a positive obligation under LAW a person \u2019s private life . But it can not possibly be argued that such respect was not afforded here . As already indicated , the respondents went to great lengths both to consult the appellant and [ her partner ] about the appellant \u2019s needs and the possible ways of meeting them and to try to reach agreement with her upon them . In doing so they sought to respect as far as possible her personal feelings and desires , at the same time taking account of her safety , her independence and their own responsibilities towards all their other clients . They respected the appellant \u2019s human dignity and autonomy , allowing her to choose the details of her care package within their overall assessment of her needs : for example , TIME of care attendance , whether to receive direct payments in order to employ her own care assistant , and the possibility of other options like extra care sheltered housing . These matters are all fully covered in paras CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of ORG judgment below . Like him , I too have the greatest sympathy for the appellant \u2019s misfortunes and a real understanding of her deepest antipathy towards using incontinence pads . But I also share ORG view that the appellant can not establish an interference here by the respondents with her LAW . I add only that , even if such an interference were established , it would be clearly justified under LAW save , of course , for the period prior to the DATE review when the respondent \u2019s proposed care provision was not \u2018 in accordance with DATE on the grounds that it is necessary for the economic well - being of the respondents and the interests of their other service - users and is a proportionate response to the appellant \u2019s needs because it affords her the maximum protection from injury , greater privacy and independence , and results in a substantial costs saving . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In her dissenting opinion , PERSON considered that the need for help to get to the lavatory or commode was so different from the need for protection from uncontrollable bodily functions that it was irrational to confuse the CARDINAL and to meet the need for CARDINAL in a manner appropriate for the other . She would therefore have allowed the appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
