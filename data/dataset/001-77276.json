The police officers were only ordered to carry out an inspection of her registered address ( kontrola meldunkowa ) .", "It should also be pointed out that it is difficult to agree with the victim \u2019s claims that the police officers by their failure to act approved the removal of her personal effects and by their presence forced her to accept the new situation . The evidence taken from witnesses shows that the police officers on numerous occasions remained at the scene at the request of the victim or M.M. Moreover , the evidence does not confirm the victim \u2019s allegations that her personal effects were taken away .", "In view of the above I conclude that the actions of the police officers complied with legal regulations and were aimed at avoiding breaches of the law by the individuals present at the scene . \u201d", "The applicant appealed against this decision , but her appeal was dismissed on DATE by ORG .
