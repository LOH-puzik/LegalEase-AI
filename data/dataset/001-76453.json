The applicants are PERSON , an NORP citizen born in DATE , and PERSON , a GPE national born in DATE , husband and wife , and their children , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , GPE citizens born in DATE respectively . They were all resident in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants became tenants of a house owned by ORG at CARDINAL FAC . The property had been vacant for DATE and the previous tenant had been PERSON or PERSON GPE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile a series of armed robberies was carried out by a number of armed males : on DATE , DATE , and CARDINAL DATE . On DATE , the police arrested a certain GPE , later convicted for the robbery . They also arrested a man who arrived during the arrest . He gave his name as PERSON but subsequent investigation revealed that he was PERSON , son of PERSON GPE . He was not charged and was released . The police were tasked with investigating , and arresting , any further members of the gang and recovering the money from the robberies . The information which came into their possession indicated that ORG had often given CARDINAL FAC as his address , that saliva taken from a scarf in a car abandoned after a robbery matched that of ORG and that PERSON was still on the voters\u2019 register as residing at that address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Detective Constable PERSON went before a Justice of the Peace and applied on oath for a warrant to search CARDINAL FAC for cash stolen during the robberies . He swore on oath that he had reasonable cause to believe that such stolen cash was in the possession of the occupier of the property . A search warrant was issued permitting a search of the LOC for the cash .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the police officers gathered at police headquarters . It was intended to search CARDINAL properties . ORG and CARDINAL other officers were detailed to go to CARDINAL FAC . They were briefed that PERSON was linked to the robberies and given a photograph of him . They knew that the robberies had involved the use of firearms . They were instructed to obtain forcible entry at TIME to coincide with the other searches .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police team used a metal ram to make a hole in the door . They experienced some difficulty as a previous tenant had reinforced the door .", "CARDINAL . The noise of the battering ram awoke and frightened the applicants . The first applicant came down the stairs and was told by the police who they were and to open the door . The first applicant complied and the sergeant entered and showed his warrant card and explained that he was looking for PERSON . A cursory examination of the house took place to verify that no one save the applicants was present . The sergeant apologised to the first and second applicants and arranged for repairs to be made to the front door . The police left at TIME", "CARDINAL . The applicants brought proceedings against the Chief Constable of Merseyside Police for the tort of maliciously procuring a search warrant , unlawful entry and false imprisonment . They alleged that they had been caused terror , distress and psychiatric harm . Medical reports indicated that the applicants were suffering from varying degrees of post traumatic stress disorder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Judge rejected the ORG claims . He made a number of findings of fact or inferences :", "\u2013 that the police made enquiries prior to the search with utility companies and ORG about CARDINAL FAC and that the rough police notes of these enquiries had been destroyed or mislaid from which he drew the adverse inference that such checks revealed that PERSON was no longer living there but that the applicants were ;", "\u2013 that the police considered covert surveillance of the property but decided that this was not advisable as there were sophisticated criminals living in the area who were skilled at spotting covert police operations ;", "\u2013 that ORG had reasonable grounds , following his briefing , for believing that a person wanted for robbery was to be found on the LOC and that he had not been informed that the applicants were now living there .", "CARDINAL . The judge found on the facts that the police , who were investigating serious and violent offences , had not acted with reckless indifference to the lawfulness of their acts , which element was necessary for the tort of maliciously procuring a search warrant . He held that the entry was made subject to a lawful search warrant and also under the powers of LAW of ORG , which allowed entry without warrant where intending to arrest a person for an arrestable offence . He found that the method of forcible entry was justified as the police had foremost in their minds the potential danger from the use of firearms by the suspect robber and in particular that the sergeant had no cause to suspect that innocent people were the only ones on the LOC . He found that once on the LOC there was no indication that the police had physically detained the applicants or ordered them to remain in CARDINAL place . He noted that the sergeant had speedily realised the mistake , apologised and shown compassion for the applicants\u2019 plight , in particular by not lengthening the ordeal .", "CARDINAL . He concluded :", "\u201c ... It will be difficult for the claimants to accept that their innocent occupation of their property was devastated by the events , albeit of TIME , which occurred on DATE . Any system of justice must balance competing interests and this is a classic case of competing interests being balanced . On the one hand , the need to bring to justice violent criminals , on the other the need to try and preserve the sanctity and integrity of a law - abiding family \u2019s home ... but in every case of competing interests , the scales will have to come down on CARDINAL side or the other . In my judgment the scales come down in favour of the defendants and all claims are dismissed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed , alleging , inter alia , that the judge had failed to consider properly whether the police had reasonable and probable cause to apply for a warrant to search for stolen cash at CARDINAL FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal . While Lord Justice PERSON found that if proper enquiries had been made and the results properly reported there would have been no reasonable or probable cause to apply for a search warrant , he held that the requirement of malice was not made out as there was no evidence of any improper motive ( incompetence or negligence did not suffice ) . He further held that the entry , being made under a warrant which was on the face of it lawful , was itself lawful and that while those responsible for sending PERSON and his team to the address had been mistaken that did not deprive them of legal protection . Lord Justice Ward commented that the shoddy detective work did not justify a finding in the police \u2019s favour and that the case caused him concern . However , notwithstanding his anxious consideration and sympathy for the family , he stated :", "\u201c That an NORP \u2019s home is said to be his castle reveals an important public interest , but there is another public interest in the detection of crime and the bringing to justice of those who commit it . These interests are in conflict in a case like this and on the law as it stood when these events occurred , which is before the coming into force of LAW DATE , which may be said to have elevated the right to respect for one \u2019s home , a finding of malice on the part of the police is the proper balancing safeguard .", "Upon careful reflection , I agree with my ORG that it is inevitable that malice will not be proved in this case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Counsel advised as follows on the prospects of obtaining leave to appeal to ORG :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Essentially , on the issue of malicious procurement of a search warrant and in trespass , the court has thought that prior to the introduction of LAW DATE , proof of malice is a necessary component of such a challenge and that the evidence was not there to prove it . It seems to me that this conclusion will not be displaced by ORG . I also think , on the authorities relating to LAW DATE , that there is no question of ORG suggesting that the courts below should have done anything differently in their approach to the case .", "CARDINAL . In my view , therefore , the prospects of seeking leave to appeal from ORG are poor and I do not advise that such leave be sought . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act DATE provides for entry and search without a search warrant :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Subject to the following provisions of this section ... , a constable may enter and search any LOC for the purpose\u2013", "...", "( b ) of arresting a person for an arrestable offence ;", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Police can also apply to the GPE court for a warrant . The grant of a warrant is subject to the safeguards in LAW . LAW provides , inter alia , that the constable must state the ground on which he makes the application and the enactment under which the warrant would be issued ; specify the premises to be entered and searched ; and identify in so far as practicable the articles or persons sought . Applications are made ex parte and supported by an information in writing . The constable must answer on oath any question put to him by the Justice of the FAC or judge . There is no statutory requirement for the court issuing the warrant to make findings or give reasons for issuing the warrant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
