At TIME on DATE the applicant took his son PERSON to the emergency unit of ORG , accompanied by their family doctor . PERSON was immediately examined by the doctor on duty , Mr C.C.R. , who recorded an initial diagnosis on the observation sheet of \u201c icteric syndrome \u201d ( jaundice ) . Following subsequent tests the diagnosis was changed to \" hepatic cirrhosis with gastrointestinal haemorrhage \u201d and the patient was treated with drugs .", "CARDINAL . Dr C.C.R. filled in forms to admit the patient to the gastroenterology unit , as provided for by the hospital \u2019s code of practice for patients with gastrointestinal haemorrhage . However , owing to the fact that the gastroenterology unit was in a separate building and had no elevator , the patient remained in the emergency unit .", "CARDINAL . Despite the treatment he was given , the patient \u2019s condition worsened and at TIME he was examined by TIME , a doctor who specialised in intensive care . She recommended that the treatment be continued and ordered blood transfusions . Owing to a lack of beds in the intensive care unit , the patient was not immediately transferred there .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , PERSON was transferred to the intensive care unit . Dr A.M. , on duty that night in the unit , came to see FAC times . At some point during TIME the blood transfusions were stopped .", "CARDINAL . After TIME the next morning PERSON \u2019s condition began to worsen and he was given blood transfusions again .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , because the patient \u2019s state continued to deteriorate , PERSON , the head of the gastroenterology unit , decided to perform an endoscopy of the stomach . The procedure did not succeed because of massive gastrointestinal bleeding .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on CARDINAL DATE PERSON was declared dead owing to cardio - respiratory failure . According to the hospital observation sheet , the direct cause of death was upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage , ruptured oesophageal varices , decompensated hepatic cirrhosis and a haemorrhagic duodenal ulcer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his wife lodged a criminal complaint against ORG and TIME , accusing them of manslaughter . The applicant firstly complained that , despite repeated requests , PERSON C.C.R. had refused to allow the patient to be transferred to another , better equipped , hospital . The applicant also complained of the failure to provide blood transfusions , which he said caused the death of his son , and of the generally poor treatment received by his son in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL doctors were questioned by ORG . Dr C.C.R. explained that the patient \u2019s state of health did not allow him to be transferred to another hospital . He also submitted that a particular medicine , Lactulose , had been missing from the hospital \u2019s pharmacy and that he had asked the applicant to buy it . Concerning the lack of blood for transfusions , the doctor said that that was not his fault and that the hospital had run out of blood that night . In conclusion , the doctor stated that the patient , who was suffering from hepatic cirrhosis , had received the necessary treatment . PERSON said that the patient \u2019s condition had had a poor prognosis , that she had provided the correct treatment and that a transfer to another hospital would not have been possible under the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s statement was taken on DATE . He reiterated his previous complaints . In addition , he criticised the delay in the administration of Lactulose to his son .", "CARDINAL . An autopsy report issued on DATE said that PERSON had not died by violent means . The death was caused by upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to the rupture of varices in the oesophagus and a duodenal ulcer in a patient already suffering from hepatic cirrhosis . The report concluded that no issues had been found that could raise questions about the medical treatment received by the patient .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant complained to ORG of excessive delays in the investigation . He also requested a forensic medical expert report to verify whether his son had received the necessary treatment . He included the results of various blood tests made by GPE DATE , intending to prove that his son had not been ill in DATE before his admission to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG sent a request for a forensic report to ORG . On DATE ORG replied that it could not deliver such a report because its chief doctor had already performed the autopsy in the same case . Therefore , on DATE the request was sent to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the forensic report was added to the case file and on DATE it was made available to the applicant . The report noted that hospital practice had not been adhered to as the patient should have been admitted to the gastroenterology section , given the diagnosis . Nevertheless , the conclusion was that the treatment received by PERSON was adequate and correct and there was no indication of medical error .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted objections to the report and requested it to be reanalysed by ORG in GPE . On DATE the applicant \u2019s objections to the forensic report were rejected by the prosecutor , who only allowed it to be referred to ORG for approval .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a CARDINAL - page letter , ORG approved the report drafted by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a briefly - worded decision based on the forensic medical report , ORG of ORG decided not to commence criminal proceedings against the CARDINAL doctors as there had been no finding of medical errors . That decision was upheld on DATE by the chief prosecutor of the same prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . A complaint by the applicant against the CARDINAL decisions was allowed by ORG on DATE . The court decided to send the case back to the prosecutor in order to commence criminal proceedings against the CARDINAL doctors . The court observed that the ORG decisions had been based only on statements by the CARDINAL doctors and on the forensic report and held that the investigators in the case needed to clarify whether the patient \u2019s state of health had required his admission to the gastroenterology unit and whether treatment in that unit could have influenced the course of the victim \u2019s illness . The court ordered that such questions should be answered by way of a more thorough investigation , taking statements from doctors specialising in gastroenterology , as well as from other employees of the hospital . In addition , the court requested the prosecutors to clarify , by way of witness statements and confrontations , what was the practice of the hospital in dealing with cases of gastrointestinal bleeding and whether the CARDINAL doctors had observed that practice . The judgment became final on DATE when an appeal on points of law by the CARDINAL doctors was rejected by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation resumed with the questioning of Dr P.P.J. , a gastroenterologist employed at ORG , and on DATE of PERSON , who had performed the endoscopy on GPE On DATE , ORG and TIME , the CARDINAL doctors under investigation , were questioned for a second time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG again found no fault in the actions of the CARDINAL doctors . That decision was communicated to the applicant on CARDINAL DATE . On DATE a complaint by the applicant against that decision was rejected as ill - founded by the chief prosecutor of the same prosecutor \u2019s office . The applicant took his case against those decisions to court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s complaint and ordered the reopening of criminal proceedings , considering that the questions raised in its judgment of DATE had still not been answered . The court held that , bearing in mind the seriousness of the case , which involved the death of a man , the investigation should have been more detailed and the applicant \u2019s allegations should have been more thoroughly checked . More specifically , the court noted that the applicant had maintained , among other things , that PERSON had been healthy and had never previously been admitted to hospital and that there had been delays in the administration of a particular drug and in giving blood transfusions . However , the medical reports had said that the deceased was suffering from an ulcer and cirrhosis . The court also reasoned that , even if it could be accepted that rapid changes could occur in such conditions , it was hard to believe that the victim had had no previous symptoms and had not been under the supervision of medical professionals prior to CARDINAL DATE . In view of the above , the court further requested that the prosecutors take statements from the family doctor and gather evidence about the victim \u2019s state of health prior to his admission to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation resumed with a letter being sent to ORG in which the prosecutor requested their assistance in obtaining a statement from the victim \u2019s family doctor , as well as copies of any medical documents she might have concerning the victim \u2019s state of health prior to his hospital admission on DATE . In DATE the family doctor , GPE , gave a statement to the police . She recalled that , during an examination in DATE , PERSON had presented with signs of hepatic distress and that she had recommended various tests . The tests had come back showing results that were slightly above the norm , so she had advised him to see a gastroenterologist .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON was again questioned on DATE . CARDINAL doctors who had been on duty when PERSON was admitted were questioned in DATE . They did not remember any relevant details about the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor \u2019s Office of ORG , considering it established that the applicant had been suffering from cirrhosis well before DATE and that nothing could have been done to save his life , decided not to press criminal charges against the CARDINAL suspects on the grounds that they had not committed any criminal act . A complaint by the applicant against that decision was rejected as ill - founded by the chief prosecutor of the same prosecutor \u2019s office on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A complaint by the applicant against the ORG decisions of CARDINAL July and CARDINAL DATE was allowed by ORG on DATE . The court considered that all the facts had still not been clarified by the investigation and again ordered the reopening of criminal proceedings . Specific instructions were again given to the prosecutors . The court noted that , in order to observe the equality of arms and to guarantee a fair trial , the applicant should have been consulted on which witnesses to hear and given the opportunity to call doctors of his own choice as witnesses . The court further reiterated the instructions given in its previous judgments in the case , which it did not consider had been carried out by the prosecutor . Finally , the court ordered the prosecutor to conduct a speedier investigation , bearing in mind that a long time had passed since the lodging of the applicant \u2019s complaint and that the inquiry had been totally ineffective up to that point .", "CARDINAL . The investigation was reopened on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE a statement from the applicant was taken by the prosecutor . He stated that he did not know the names or addresses of the medical staff on duty at the time of the incident . He further requested a confrontation with the CARDINAL doctors under investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor asked ORG for a list of employees on duty on DATE of PERSON \u2019s stay in hospital . On DATE the hospital replied that it no longer had the duty sheets as that type of document was only kept for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL doctors specialising in gastroenterology , called as witnesses by the applicant , testified before the prosecutor that the diagnosis and treatment applied by Drs C.C.R. and A.M. had been correct in the circumstances . They noted that the only drug capable of removing blood from the stomach in order to prepare the patient for an endoscopy under the proper conditions was not available in GPE at that time .", "CARDINAL . A confrontation between ORG , A.M. and the applicant took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE the prosecutor took statements from several employees of ORG . They all declared that they did not remember anything about the patient GPE", "CARDINAL . By a decision issued on DATE ORG of ORG ended its criminal investigation , finding no guilt in the actions of the CARDINAL doctors . The prosecutor noted that according to the hospital \u2019s practice , the patient should have been admitted to the gastroenterology unit but that this had not been possible because the unit did not have an elevator for wheeled beds . However , the prosecutor observed that all the medical reports drafted in the case had concluded that the patient \u2019s diagnosis had been correct and that he had had the appropriate treatment . This conclusion was also confirmed by the CARDINAL specialists called as witnesses by the applicant . The prosecutor stated that the endoscopy performed before the patient \u2019s death had been rendered more difficult owing to the absence in the country of the drug needed to clear blood from the patient \u2019s stomach . With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning the ORG failure to administer blood transfusions , the prosecutor held that the patient \u2019s death had been caused not only by anaemia but also by hepatic insufficiency .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor \u2019s decision was upheld on DATE by the head prosecutor of ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . A complaint by the applicant against those CARDINAL decisions was rejected with final effect on DATE by ORG . The court , quoting widely from the prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE , held that the investigation had correctly led to the conclusion that there was no proof of fault by the CARDINAL doctors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his wife lodged a disciplinary complaint against Drs C.C.R. and A.M.", "CARDINAL . The disciplinary committee of ORG opened an investigation into the patient \u2019s death , collecting documents from the patient \u2019s medical file and taking statements from the doctors who had treated him . It gave its decision on DATE , ruling that no medical errors had been made .", "CARDINAL . The applicant objected to the committee \u2019s conclusions and his appeal was examined by the superior disciplinary committee of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the evidence presented to it , on DATE ORG terminated the disciplinary proceedings against Drs C.C.R. and A.M. Relying on the medical documents in the file and on the opinion of a university professor , the authority considered that it had been established that no medical errors had been made .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his wife brought an action for the quashing of the decision adopted on DATE , pointing to the failure by the CARDINAL doctors to provide appropriate treatment for their son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the action as illfounded and upheld the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . An appeal by the applicant against that judgment was allowed by ORG on DATE . The case was sent to ORG for rehearing because the lower court had not examined any evidence other than the documents in the file , which had been the sole basis for its decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG took note of the fact that the applicant and his wife no longer wished to pursue the proceedings and closed the case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
