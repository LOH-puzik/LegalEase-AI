The relevant passages of the judgments read as follows :", "\u201c a ) Meaning of non - liability and parliamentary immunity", "All democratic countries have granted the members of their legislative assemblies certain privileges and immunities in order to allow them to perform their legislative tasks properly . Quite evidently , the aim of granting the members of legislative assemblies a different status from that enjoyed by other citizens is not to make them a privileged group who are above the law .", "Parliamentary immunity is not an aim ; it is a means of enabling MPs to fulfil the nation 's wishes in full by perfectly reflecting the wishes of the people within the ORG .", "Even though LAW is entitled \u201c Parliamentary Immunity \u201d , it actually establishes CARDINAL institutions : parliamentary non - liability and parliamentary immunity . The first paragraph of the Article explains that the members of ORG of GPE are not liable for their votes and statements in the course of the ORG 's work , for the views they express before the ORG or , unless the ORG decides otherwise on the proposal of the Speaker , for repeating or revealing these outside the ORG .", "The second paragraph of the Article stipulates that a Member who is alleged to have committed an offence before or after election may not be arrested , interrogated , detained or tried unless the ORG decides otherwise .

That does not mean that the legislature has a free hand in the matter . The rationale for immunity and the way in which it has developed over DATE show that ORG 's powers concerning the lifting of immunity are not absolute but limited . Furthermore , the fact that immunity has a place in the LAW means that the rules and aims of immunity must be defined in the light of the rules and aims of LAW . There is no doubt that the intention , when immunity was provided for in LAW , was to allow those responsible for legislative duties to carry them out in the knowledge that they were safely sheltered , and rightly so , from all worry and pressure . In other words , the aim of parliamentary immunity is to ensure that MPs are not prevented from fulfilling their functions , even temporarily , by arbitrary criminal proceedings . So the powers of the legislature in the matter are limited by the purpose for which immunity was institutionalised in LAW .

It should be noted that parliamentary immunity in the form of \u201c inviolability \u201d is substantially debated and challenged by civil society . The scope of parliamentary immunity has been identified as one of the problem areas in the context of corruption .", "CARDINAL . The circle of high ranking officials who enjoy immunity ( inviolability ) stricto sensu under the LAW is limited to the President of the Republic , members of ORG , Prime Minister and ministers who in principle are also members of ORG . ( ... )", "CARDINAL . In the view of the GET , the regulation of the lifting of immunity of the members of ORG ( LAW and Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Regulation of ORG ) does not establish adequate conditions for objective considerations within the relevant parliamentary committees . A request by the prosecutor for the lifting of immunity is submitted to the Minister of ORG . After that , the request is transferred to ORG . ORG Prime Minister finally submits the request to the relevant parliamentary committee , which may delegate to sub - committees further consideration before the parliamentary committee brings the case to the Plenary for decision . No objective criteria have been established as regards the conditions for lifting immunity and the considerations would therefore appear to be political . Moreover , the GET was informed that the procedure may be lengthy , DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , CARDINAL requests to lift the immunity of CARDINAL Members of ORG had been submitted ; CARDINAL of these cases had related to abuse of function . There was no case where the Parliamentary immunity had been lifted . It seems that the established system of Parliamentary immunity and its application in practice constitutes an insuperable obstacle to the investigation , prosecution and adjudication of corruption offences . Therefore , the GET recommends to reconsider the system of immunities of members of ORG in such a way as to establish specific and objective criteria to be applied when deciding on requests for the lifting of immunities and to ensure that decisions concerning immunity are free from political considerations and are based on the merits of the request submitted by the prosecutor . ( ... ) ORG", "CARDINAL . Most NORP states recognise CARDINAL categories of immunity for parliamentarians : firstly , the \" non - liability \" or \" freedom of speech \" of parliamentarians in respect of judicial proceedings over the opinions expressed and votes cast in the discharge of their parliamentary duties ; secondly , their \" inviolability \" or \" immunity in the strict sense \" , shielding them from all arrest , detention or prosecution without the consent of the chamber to which they belong .", "CARDINAL . The precise scope of the immunity varies considerably from CARDINAL country to another . This results in a wide array of legal approaches to its implementation . In some GPE there is no such institution ( The GPE , GPE ) . In others its scope is very limited . For example , in the GPE immunity covers civil matters only and MPs enjoy no particular protection in criminal matters and are treated like any other individual . In GPE and GPE parliamentary immunity serves to prevent MPs from being arrested during sessions or on their way to or from ORG . It therefore affords them minimal protection .", "CARDINAL . That said , most of GPE Parties to the PERSON grant their MPs non - professional immunity from criminal prosecution during their term as MPs ( GPE , GPE , GPE DATE if the act does not clearly fall outside the ambit of their political activities \u2013 and GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ) and/or protection against imprisonment or deprivation of liberty ( arrest or detention in all those countries which provide for immunity from prosecution , as well as GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . In certain cases MPs are protected from bodily searches , house searches and interception of their communications ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ) . Such proceedings or measures may be executed only with the consent of the assembly to which the MP belongs , Except in GPE , where such decisions lie with the courts .", "CARDINAL . In several GPE the scope of immunity has been restricted , as witnessed by some recent constitutional reforms . In GPE , for example , since the constitutional reform of DATE , the ORG 's authorisation is no longer necessary for criminal proceedings to be brought , but only for detention , arrest and other judicial supervision measures . A similar change came about in GPE when LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE did away with the need for the prior authorisation of ORG in order for criminal proceedings to be brought against an MP . In GPE , since the constitutional reform of DATE , senators may be placed under judicial investigation or criminal proceedings may be brought against them for acts not connected with votes cast or political opinions expressed in the course of their duties as senators .", "CARDINAL . In GPE 's GPE the practice is generally for a new parliament to lift immunity from prosecution for all offences ( with the exception of political defamation ) at the start of the session . The aim of this is to protect the reputation of each Member of ORG , by ensuring that they attract less media attention if proceedings are brought against them . In DATE ORG published an opinion concerning a draft decision of ORG on the limitation of parliamentary immunity and the conditions in which authorisation to initiate investigations into corruption offences and abuse of duty may be given . That draft decision is an illustration of the current trend to limit the scope of immunity in NORP parliaments , at least where immunity from prosecution is concerned .", "CARDINAL . The duration of parliamentary immunity also varies from CARDINAL country to another . Some countries extend parliamentary immunity to criminal proceedings brought prior to the ORG 's election ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ) . In other countries , even if parliamentary authorisation is not required in order for proceedings initiated prior to the MP 's election to be continued , ORG may , of its own motion or at the request of the interested party , request the suspension of the proceedings or the waiving of restrictive measures during the MP 's term of office ( GPE , GPE , GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the scope of parliamentary immunity ratione materiae , that is to say the acts it covers , there is a general tendency in the GPE Parties to the LAW for cases of flagrante delicto to be excluded . In certain constitutions flagrante delicto does not suffice to justify the lifting of parliamentary immunity ; the crime must be a particularly serious one ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ) , but even this does not necessarily prevent ORG from examining the matter and subsequently requesting the suspension of the proceedings or the custodial measures . In GPE , for example , even if the MP is caught in the act , subsequent legal action may require the authorisation of the ORG concerned . In some countries the law excludes certain types of act from immunity ( LAW excludes high treason , felony and breach of the peace , for example ) or the criterion may be the severity of the penalty incurred ( LAW excludes , in certain circumstances , deliberate offences punishable with imprisonment for DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Parliamentary immunity may be lifted in most countries , except in those which afford very limited protection to MPs ( GPE , GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The procedure for lifting immunity is generally the same . It is usually provided for in ORG . It is set in motion by a proposal or a request for authorisation by the competent public authority ( in most cases ORG ) , the injured party or the parliamentarian concerned . The request is transmitted to the Speaker of the ORG , either directly or in certain cases through another authority ( Minister of ORG , Prime Minister ) , then examined by a special or ad hoc parliamentary committee , which gives an opinion after hearing the MP concerned . It is then for the full Chamber to decide , with or without a debate , in private or in public , whether or not to lift immunity . The possibility of appealing against a decision of the ORG to lift immunity exists in very few countries ( GPE , GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The possibility for MPs to waive their own parliamentary immunity is not widespread ( GPE , GPE ) and is sometimes limited to minor offences ( summary offences in GPE ) or to specific offences ( defamation , in GPE ) . Under GPE 's LAW MPs have the right to consent to criminal proceedings . In GPE LAW gives MPs the right to consent in writing to be prosecuted or arrested .", "CARDINAL . In most of GPE no provision is made for MPs to forgo their immunity of their own free will because immunity is a privilege granted not to MPs on an individual basis but to ORG , to guarantee its smooth operation . In GPE provisions governing immunity are traditionally a matter of public policy and MPs can not renounce it . Any act that violates parliamentary immunity is considered null and void . The question of immunity must be raised by a judge .
