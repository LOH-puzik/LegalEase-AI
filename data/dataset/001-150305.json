On DATE a senior investigator , PERSON , of the district prosecutor \u2019s office refused to open a criminal investigation into ORG alleged abduction . In his decision the investigator summed up the statements provided by the applicant \u2019s family as regards the events of DATE . He further noted that he had not yet received any materials concerning the operation conducted by law - enforcement officers at the applicant \u2019s residence and concluded that there was no evidence to support her allegations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant provided a statement to the prosecutor \u2019s office of GPE , alleging that law - enforcement agents were implicated in her son \u2019s abduction , torture and unlawful killing .

On DATE the applicant was notified that her application had been added to criminal case no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator closed criminal case no . CARDINAL . Referring to the crime - scene examination report , forensic evidence ( examination of the bullet shell , the machine gun and its ammunition and the fragments of the spent grenade found at the crime scene , and the examination of the deceased \u2019s body ) and the statements made by the applicant and her family , the investigator concluded that sufficient evidence collected in the course of the criminal investigation indicated that ORG had attempted to kill a law - enforcement agent and the case should be closed in view of his death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the ORG district investigative division of the prosecutor \u2019s office of the GPE quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and re - opened the criminal investigation . In particular , he stated that the investigator had failed to verify the circumstances of ORG abduction ( the alleged perpetrators had not been questioned , the cars used by the persons who had abducted the deceased had not been identified , and ORG alleged involvement in a terrorist organisation had not been confirmed ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator refused to institute criminal proceedings into the abduction of the deceased . The investigator concluded that ORG had been released by \u201c the persons who had abducted him \u201d and that he had been a member of an illegal armed group who \u201c had threatened the life of ORG agents \u201d on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . According to her , her son had been kidnapped by ORG agents . He had then been tortured and killed by them . In order to disguise those crimes , the agents had taken her son \u2019s body to the forest and left it there together with a PERSON machine gun , alleging that he had been killed when attempting to assault them . When the applicant had received her son \u2019s body , it had already started to decompose and was covered with numerous injuries such as bruises , burns and cuts . His arm had been almost completely severed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s allegations as unsubstantiated , upholding the investigator \u2019s findings of DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG of GPE upheld the decision of DATE on appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , in the course of the investigation into the activities of an illegal armed group , CARDINAL of the suspects testified that ORG had been a leading member of the group .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal investigation into the circumstance of ORG death was re - opened . The investigator questioned CARDINAL military officers , NORP and PERSON , who had participated in the operation conducted by ORG forces on CARDINAL DATE . They submitted that in the course of the operation ORG had opened gunfire against their military unit and they had had to put an end to his attack and had shot back at him . He had died in the exchange of gunfire . The investigator also noted that he had been unable to determine whether the vehicles used by the alleged abductors had belonged to the ORG in view of the destruction of the relevant documentation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator closed the investigation into the events of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted the digital photographs of ORG body taken by his sister to an independent expert centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE forensic medical experts examined the photographs . They considered that some of them could not be examined in view of their poor quality . From the remainder of the photographs , the experts discerned CARDINAL wounds : a gunshot wound on the right side of the chest ; a deep wound on the left shoulder joint , probably resulting from a blow by a blunt solid object ; a surface wound on the left side of the chest ( the experts ruled out the possibility of its being a gunshot wound ) ; and a wound on the left side of the back , possibly caused by a hollow rectangular box - shaped object . In addition to the bruises documented in the official forensic report , the experts noted abrasions and bruises on the deceased \u2019s chest . Lastly , they concluded that all the injuries visible in the photographs of ORG must have been caused while he was still alive .", "CARDINAL . Referring to her account of the events of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs TIME ) , the applicant maintained that her son ORG had been abducted , detained , tortured and executed by ORG agents . The NORP authorities had falsely accused him of being a member of an illegal armed group in an attempt to cover up ORG agents\u2019 unlawful actions .", "CARDINAL . The Government denied any involvement of its agents in ORG abduction . They argued that ORG had been a member of an illegal armed group and considered that the abduction had been staged by his co - conspirators . In their opinion , the applicant \u2019s allegations concerning her son \u2019s abduction , detention and torture lacked any evidentiary basis .", "CARDINAL . A number of principles have been developed in the ORG \u2019s case - law as regards cases where the ORG is faced with the task of establishing facts on which the parties disagree . As to the facts that are in dispute , the ORG refers to its jurisprudence requiring the standard of proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d in its assessment of evidence ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVII ( extracts ) ) . Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact . In this context , the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account ( see ORG and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL\u2013VIII ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first - instance tribunal of fact , where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case ( see , for example , ORG v. GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . Nonetheless , where allegations are made under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention , the ORG must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny ( see , mutatis mutandis , PERSON v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL ; and ORG , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that it has noted the difficulties for applicants to obtain the necessary evidence in support of allegations in cases where the respondent Government are in possession of the relevant documentation and fail to submit it . Where the applicant makes out a prima facie case and the ORG is prevented from reaching factual conclusions owing to the lack of such documents , it is for the ORG to convince the ORG that the documents in question can not serve to corroborate the allegations made by the applicant , or to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred . The burden of proof is thus shifted to the ORG and if they fail in their arguments , issues will arise under LAW ( see GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ; and Akkum and Others v. GPE , no . TIME , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALII ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has previously found the NORP State authorities responsible for extra - judicial executions or disappearances of civilians in GPE in a number of cases , even in the absence of final conclusions from the domestic investigation ( see GPE and GPE , cited above ; PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . MONEY , ECHR CARDINALXIII ( extracts ) ; Estamirov and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; and GPE v. GPE , no . MONEY , DATE ) . It has done so primarily on the basis of witness statements and other documents attesting to the presence of military or security personnel in the area concerned at the relevant time . It has relied on references to military vehicles and equipment , on witness accounts , on other information on security operations and on the undisputed effective control of the areas in question by the NORP military . On that basis , it has concluded that the areas in question were \u201c within the exclusive control of the authorities of the ORG \u201d in view of military or security operations being conducted there and the presence of servicemen ( see , for example , PERSON v. GPE , no . GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on the basis of the account of the events given by the applicant in the present case , the ORG has little evidence on which to draw such conclusions .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that the documents submitted by the ORG provide no evidence of a security operation having taken place on DATE . As to the applicant \u2019s submissions , she and her relatives witnessed the abduction of ORG . In support of her argument that her son had been abducted by ORG agents , she argued that the men who had taken her son had been armed , spoke LANGUAGE , NORP and PERSON and that some of them had been wearing camouflage uniforms and had arrived in civilian PERSON cars .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is not convinced , however , that those details necessarily prove that the men were ORG servicemen . The applicant did not allege that the camouflage uniform some of the men had been wearing had borne any of the insignia characteristic of the uniform of ORG agents . It can not be ruled out that the uniform , as well as the firearms carried by the men , could have been obtained by them via various , possibly illegal , channels . Furthermore , there are no witness statements confirming that ORG was taken to any ORG agency after his abduction . In this connection , the ORG also takes into account the applicant \u2019s own statement to the prosecutor \u2019s office in which she expressed doubts as to the affiliation of the kidnappers with any ORG agency ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the information in the ORG \u2019s possession does not suffice to establish that ORG was kidnapped and held in detention by ORG agents . In such circumstances , the ORG can not attribute responsibility for the unlawful acts in the present case to the respondent ORG without additional evidence to that effect .", "CARDINAL . It has not , therefore , been established to the required standard of proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d that ORG agents were implicated in the abduction and ensuing detention , if any , of ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
