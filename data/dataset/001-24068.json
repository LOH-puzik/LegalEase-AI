IRELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals , born in DATE and DATE , respectively . They both live in GPE . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are insurance brokers . On DATE they issued a plenary summons beginning a libel action against ORG ( \u201c IBA \u201d ) : they took issue with a letter circulated by the ORG indicating that the ORG membership of the ORG had been terminated due to non - compliance with the requirements of LAW DATE . LAW stipulates that every person who contravenes the LAW shall be guilty of an offence .", "On DATE the applicants filed a statement of claim . Further to a motion of the applicants , on DATE ORG ordered the ORG to deliver its defence .", "On DATE ORG , following the applicants\u2019 motion , accepted that their solicitors had ceased to be on record .", "On DATE another solicitor ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) filed a notice of change of solicitor , thereby coming on record for the applicants . The case was also set down for trial . The hearing of the case was initially fixed for DATE but it could not be heard on DATE . By DATE ORG had come off record although he continued to assist the applicants informally .", "On DATE the case came on for hearing ( \u201c first hearing \u201d ) before PERSON Justice PERSON and a jury . It was submitted by the ORG that the applicants had gone beyond the ambit of the pleadings in the course of their opening speech to the jury and it was deemed necessary by the trial judge to discharge the jury .", "On DATE the hearing re - commenced before a new jury and Mr Justice PERSON ( \u201c second hearing \u201d ) . It ended on DATE when the jury returned a verdict in favour of the applicants and awarded the applicants MONEY ( GPE ) . The trial judge ordered the ORG to discharge the ORG costs when taxed and ascertained .", "In DATE the ORG appealed arguing that the defence of \u201c qualified privilege \u201d should have been admitted and that the damages were excessive . They requested a new trial or that ORG render judgment in the terms of their notice of appeal .", "ORG heard the appeal on DATE and reserved judgment which was delivered on DATE . ORG ( Mr Justice O\u2019Flaherty giving the judgment of the ORG , with which the CARDINAL other judges agreed ) dismissed the appeal as regards the question of qualified privilege . However , it allowed the appeal on the question of damages , finding the award excessive . Accordingly , the action was remitted to ORG for a new trial on the question of damages only . The ORG was ordered to discharge the applicants\u2019 costs of the appeal when taxed and ascertained .", "On DATE the applicants filed a notice in ORG confirming the re - appointment of ORG as their legal representative , but by DATE they were filing their own pleadings in ORG .", "By notice of motion dated DATE the applicants requested , inter alia , that their case be heard as a matter of priority . The ORG also motioned to strike out parts of the ORG submissions as \u201c scandalous \u201d . On DATE ORG granted the priority request ordering that the case be listed first in the list to fix dates for jury actions : that list would be called over on CARDINAL DATE and the judge doing so would also decide on the ORG \u2019s motion .", "On DATE the ORG issued CARDINAL motions in ORG seeking discovery of documents relevant to the quantum of damages including access to the ORG past business records and seeking leave to make a lodgment into ORG in respect of the libel established . On DATE , at a call - over of the case - list , a hearing date was not fixed given the outstanding discovery matter . On DATE the applicants issued a counter - motion seeking maximum priority for the fixing of a hearing date on damages during the following court term .", "On DATE the High Court heard these motions and reserved judgment . On DATE ORG ( Mr Justice PERSON ) delivered a detailed judgment ordering the applicants to deliver particulars of , and disclose documents concerning , turnover for a period of DATE prior to the libel and particulars of their claimed losses . The ORG was given liberty to amend its defence to allow it to lodge a sum of money into court . It was also ordered that the action be accorded priority in the GPE jury lists for the following legal term . The applicants were awarded their costs of the ORG \u2019s motion concerning its lodgment into court and the court \u2019s decision on other ORG matters was reserved .", "On DATE the applicants filed an affidavit of discovery . On DATE the applicants filed a motion to have the hearing specially fixed in accordance with the priority accorded on DATE . On DATE the ORG filed an amended defence and on DATE the ORG replied . On DATE the ORG filed a motion requesting that part of the applicants\u2019 reply be struck out ( as being , inter alia , prolix , in part scandalous , unnecessary , and irrelevant ) and for the applicants to make full discovery in accordance with the court order of DATE . The ORG supported their motion by affidavits dated DATE and DATE and the applicants filed an affidavit on DATE . On DATE the ORG priority listing motion was considered but no order was made pending the outstanding discovery matter .", "By notice dated DATE , the applicants discharged ORG as their solicitor . On DATE also the ORG \u2019s motion ( of DATE ) was heard in ORG ( Mr Justice PERSON ) which ordered a significant portion of the applicants\u2019 reply to be struck out and that they make discovery as already ordered on DATE . The decision on costs of the motion was reserved . The action was listed for mention on DATE .", "The applicants filed CARDINAL more affidavits on DATE , inter alia , objecting to producing certain documents and making some discovery .", "On DATE ORG ( Mr Justice PERSON ) ordered the applicants to respond within DATE to an outstanding matter raised in the ORG \u2019s affidavit of CARDINAL DATE . A decision as to the award to be made on the costs of that hearing and court order was reserved . The action was listed for mention on DATE .", "By affidavit of CARDINAL DATE the applicants responded to the matter raised in the ORG affidavit of DATE . On CARDINAL and DATE the ORG filed affidavits in the High Court concerning certain discovery matters . On DATE also ORG ( Mr Justice PERSON ) heard the parties , noted their agreement that the ORG inspect certain of the applicants\u2019 documents and it was ordered that it be done before DATE . Costs were reserved . On DATE the applicants and the ORG filed affidavits concerning discovery . The applicants submit that on DATE ORG examined these matters refused the ORG \u2019s motion and did not make a ORG order in their favour .", "On DATE the ORG wrote to the applicants indicating that many of the matters they had referred to in their reply were not admissible and that objection would be taken at the opening of the trial on damages if the applicants attempted to introduce them ( mainly concerning the applicants\u2019 new claim for exemplary damages ) .", "The hearing ( \u201c third hearing \u201d ) on the question of damages took place before ORG ( Mr Justice PERSON ) from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE , on which latter date the trial judge made certain preliminary rulings and directions , pursuant to the ORG \u2019s motion , excluding submissions by the applicants on certain matters considered to fall outside of the scope of the damages\u2019 proceedings . Since the applicant who was pleading had fallen ill , the matter was adjourned to CARDINAL DATE . By then , the applicants had considered the rulings of the trial judge and formed the view that the trial judge had thereby taken away their right to a proper trial on the damages\u2019 aspect . The order of CARDINAL DATE records that the applicants had \u201c refused to proceed \u201d . It was ordered that their claim for damages be dismissed and that the ORG recover the costs of the hearing together with their costs of the motions in respect of which costs had been reserved . The money lodged in court by the ORG could be withdrawn by the ORG .", "On DATE the applicants appealed against those orders of ORG and requested a new trial which would include their submissions excluded by ORG in DATE . ORG heard the appeal on DATE . On DATE judgment was delivered ( by Mr Justice O\u2019Flaherty ) : the court found in the ORG favour ( considering , inter alia , that the applicants should have been allowed to make submissions on exemplary and aggravated damages ) and ordered a new trial in ORG and the ORG was to re - lodge the sum of money back into court . No order was made as to the costs of the appeal : the costs of the third hearing and of the new trial were matters for the new trial judge .", "Further to the applicants\u2019 motion dated DATE , ORG ordered ( on CARDINAL DATE ) that the re - trial of the action be specially fixed for DATE of jury hearings the following legal term .", "On CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE ORG hearing on damages ( \u201c fourth hearing \u201d ) took place before Mr Justice PERSON and a jury . On DATE the jury awarded the sums of QUANTITY ( ORG ) ( damages ) and ORG CARDINAL ( aggravated damages ) in compensation . No exemplary award was made . The applicants were also to recover the costs of that hearing together with those costs reserved on DATE ( both motions ) , DATE and on DATE as well as the costs of DATE of the third hearing .", "On DATE the applicants submitted their ORG calculations to the Taxing Master . The ORG responded on DATE and the applicants on DATE . On DATE the Taxing Master delivered rulings on the taxation of costs , disallowing certain of the ORG claims and allowing others . Further hearings on costs took place before the Taxing Master on DATE , DATE and DATE , on DATE and DATE . On DATE the Taxing Master made further rulings and issued a report on the ORG costs on DATE .", "On DATE the applicants issued a motion to review in the High Court the taxation rulings . The applicants took issue , inter alia , with the Taxing Master \u2019s refusal to award them legal costs at ORG TIME as they were not represented and to award them instead an TIME amount for the time they spent in court at the standard rate applicable to the profession of which they were both members ( insurance brokers ) . They also took issue with the decision not to allow all of the costs claimed in respect of the informal assistance of a solicitor after their solicitors had came off record ( ORG CARDINAL was awarded for this ) . On DATE the ORG also lodged a cross - motion to review certain aspects of the Taxing Master \u2019s award submitting , inter alia , that no award at all should have been made in respect of this informal assistance .", "By detailed judgment dated DATE ORG ( Mr Justice Kelly ) dismissed the ORG appeal and allowed the ORG \u2019s appeal . ORG found reasonable the Taxing Master \u2019s refusal to award the applicants the sum of ORG TIME in respect of the time they spent on their own case : the refusal was in line with jurisprudence and the Taxing Master had reasonably made an award for the time spent by the applicants in court at the standard TIME rate charged by insurance brokers . Indeed , it was noted that the applicants had taken the figure of ORG TIME from a newspaper cutting , that the applicants had been unable to present firm evidence to the Taxing Master as to their actual TIME earnings ( evidence from the trial indicated that their rate was between ORG TIME ) and that the purpose of taxation of costs was reimbursement of costs and not profit - making . As to the award of IEP CARDINAL for informal legal assistance , ORG found that the Taxing Master had erred in law and allowed the ORG appeal on this point .", "Otherwise ORG considered and confirmed the Taxing Master \u2019s disallowance of costs claimed by the applicants for procedures in respect of which \u201c no order as to costs \u201d had been made by a court ( not least because the applicants had not appealed those orders at the time ) . ORG also considered and confirmed the Taxing Master \u2019s rulings on miscellaneous items including mileage / travelling / parking ( an allowance made ) , copying ( no allowance made ) , and the costs of purchasing legal text books ( no allowance made ) .", "In addition , ORG judge referred to the voluminous criticisms and allegations against the members of ORG , a professional institution , barristers , solicitors and a number of ORG judges including ORG President which the applicants had attempted to introduce into the appeal . Apart from not being relevant to the current appeal , ORG judge considered those comments to be \u201c serious and scurrilous \u201d and demonstrative of the fact that \u201c obsession has replaced reason and invective has replaced argument \u201d .", "ORG also made an award of the costs of the appeal in favour of the ORG , on the understanding that the ORG would not enforce it if the applicants did not appeal further .", "The applicants claim that they then sought the perfected order of ORG and , when they received it , considered its terms did not reflect what had been ordered . Accordingly , on DATE they applied for an extension of time to appeal to ORG . On DATE the ORG agreed to the extension of time ( until DATE ) . Costs of that application were awarded to the ORG .", "On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG claiming , inter alia , that it was unfair that they had not been awarded costs in respect of the time and effort which went into representing themselves whereas a solicitor representing himself would have been granted costs . On DATE the appeal court heard the appeal and reserved judgment . The applicants prepared CARDINAL typed pages of an opening statement for ORG and state that they were allowed to read aloud CARDINAL pages only ( which CARDINAL pages included their challenge to the accuracy of the High Court judgment of DATE ) .", "On DATE ORG delivered its judgment dismissing the appeal finding , inter alia , that , according to relevant case - law , costs could not be recovered by lay litigants since only legal costs which could be measured by the court could be awarded . The court noted that , in the case of solicitors representing themselves , the costs for their professional skill and labour are capable of being measured and , as pointed out in the case - law , it would be absurd to permit a solicitor to employ another solicitor and recover the costs but not permit him to recover costs if he chose to represent himself . On DATE ORG made an order for the costs of that appeal in favour of the ORG .", "By summons dated DATE and requested by the ORG , the applicants were convoked before the Taxing Master on DATE for the examination of the costs of the ORG in successfully defending their appeals against taxation of costs . The Taxing Master refused the applicants\u2019 application for an adjournment and on DATE he awarded ORG euros ( \u201c EUR \u201d ) to the ORG in respect of the costs of those appeals . The applicants did not appeal against this award .", "On DATE the ORG informed the applicants that they had registered judgment against their property . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicants sent cheques to the ORG in payment of the costs awarded together with interest and asked the ORG to withdraw the judgments against their property . The ORG requested the applicants to forward the appropriate documentation for the vacation of the judgments and it appears that correspondence has continued thereafter on this question ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
