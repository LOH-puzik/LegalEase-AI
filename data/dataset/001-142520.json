In assessing the maximum permitted noise levels this report considered that the applicant \u2019s house fell within zone CARDINAL under section CARDINAL of the by - law pertaining to dwellings and business LOC where the predominant use is as residential property ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

He also submitted that the noise had been measured on the balcony of the applicant \u2019s flat on the first floor and that while the measurements were being taken all sources of the noise in the bar had been switched on . He explained that he had not taken into account the documentation on noise insulation because that was not part of his remit . He also considered that the operation of the air - conditioning fan in the bar could in no way influence the level of noise in the applicant \u2019s flat . Lastly , the expert witness pointed out that the previous noise measurements had not found the level of noise in the applicant \u2019s flat to be excessive .", "CARDINAL .
