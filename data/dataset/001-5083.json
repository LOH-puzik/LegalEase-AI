POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE and living in GPE .", "A.", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against a decision of ORG by which the latter had refused to grant him retirement pension for persons working in difficult conditions . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with ORG , which transmitted it to ORG .", "On DATE ORG , following an order of ORG , requested the applicant to supplement his appeal by indicating what errors of fact and law had allegedly been committed by the court during the examination of the case . This order was served on the applicant on DATE and he was informed that he should comply with it within DATE from its service .", "On DATE the applicant submitted pleadings to the court explaining the grounds of his appeal . The date of submitting the pleadings to the court is clearly certified by a stamp of the court \u2019s registry on a copy of the document .", "By a decision of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal , finding that he had failed to comply with its order of DATE .", "In DATE the applicant requested assistance from his local MP , complaining that ORG had rejected his appeal , having failed to take into consideration his pleadings of DATE . In reply to the ORG \u2019s enquiry as to circumstances in which the applicant \u2019s appeal had been rejected , ORG informed him by a letter of DATE that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE had became final since the applicant had failed to complement his appeal within the time - limit fixed by the court for that purpose .", "In reply , by a letter to the President of ORG DATE , the MP referred to information he had received on DATE in a telephone conversation with ORG registry , according to which the applicant had failed to pick up the court \u2019s decision of DATE at the post office . The MP reiterated his request that the applicant \u2019s complaint be thoroughly investigated .", "By a letter of DATE the President of ORG of ORG informed the MP that on DATE the applicant had complemented his appeal , but , since his appeal so complemented still did not comply with the requirements that the law attached to an appeal against a first - instance judicial decision , the court rejected it on DATE . This decision was later duly served on the applicant , in a manner compatible with the requirements of LAW .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of DATE . He submitted that the court , when rejecting his appeal on DATE , must have been unaware that he had complied with its order to complement it by detailed arguments . Thus , his appeal had been rejected erroneously .", "He further submitted that this decision had been served on him only in DATE . He also stated that he did not pick up the decision of DATE at the post office , as in DATE he had been on DATE for DATE . It had only been in DATE that he had enquired about the further course of the proceedings . He had received a copy of the decision from which it transpired that it had been taken on the erroneous ground of his alleged failure to comply with the court \u2019s order to supplement his appeal .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court found that the decision of DATE had been sent to the applicant by registered letter . It could not be served on him because of his absence . On DATE , the decision was deposited at the post office . As the applicant did not pick it up at the post office within the CARDINAL - days\u2019 time - limit provided for by law , it was not delivered to him . On DATE the decision was returned to the court and deposited in the case - file . Pursuant to LAW , it should therefore be regarded as having been duly served . Thus , the applicant \u2019s appeal had to be rejected , having been lodged out of time .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "LAW , insofar as relevant , provides that if a party to proceedings fails to comply with the prescribed time - limit without its fault , the court shall , on that party \u2019s request , grant leave to appeal out of time .", "Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that the parties to proceedings are under an obligation to inform the court about any changes in their addresses . Under \u00a7 CARDINAL of this provision , if they fail to do so , a decision to be served on the party shall be filed in the case - file and shall be regarded as having been duly served , unless the court knows the new address of that party ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
