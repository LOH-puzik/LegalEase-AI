This statement was quoted in the NORP media .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the company publishing the newspaper \u201c ORG \u201d brought injunction proceedings under section CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG ) against the applicant with ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) .

In the context of private prosecution proceedings instituted by the applicant in respect of the article of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) , as confirmed by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) on DATE , convicted the company publishing the \u201c PERSON - Zeitung \u201d of defamation , pursuant to LAW ( Mediengesetz ) , and ordered it to pay compensation to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the injunction claim . The Court observed that section CARDINAL of LAW envisaged an injunction in respect of any statement of facts which jeopardised someone 's reputation , income or livelihood , the untruth of which was known or must have been known . Considering all circumstances , and in particular the background of the press conference and the impugned statement , the ORG found that the applicant had used the expression \u201c NORP - journalism \u201d as a value - judgment . The ORG based its decision on the statements made by the applicant and various witnesses , as well as on an expert opinion regarding the interpretation of the expression \u201c NORP - journalism \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the plaintiff 's appeal ( GPE ) . ORG confirmed the findings of the first instance court that the impugned statement was a value - judgment . Furthermore , even assuming that the impugned statement was an untrue statement of fact , the plaintiff had failed to show that the applicant had known or should have known that this statement was untrue . In this respect , ORG referred to the expert opinion according to which the defamation of political opponents with an alleged illness was an essential element of the journalism under the NORP regime . Furthermore , even assuming that the impugned statement amounted to an insult , it was justified as a reaction to the plaintiff 's previous publication on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) , upon the plaintiff 's further appeal ( au\u00dferordentliche Revision ) , reversed ORG decision and issued an injunction against the applicant prohibiting him from repeating the statement that the article of CARDINAL DATE amounted to \u201c NORP - journalism \u201d , and similar statements .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , section CARDINAL LAW presupposed facts , i.e. circumstances , the existence of which could be demonstrated . If a value - judgment was based on particular facts it comprised a statement of facts . The question whether or not \u201c facts \u201d had been disseminated had to be examined against the general context of the impugned statement , as understood by the man in the street . In this respect the interpretation least favourable to the offender had to be placed on the statement . Objective criticism presupposed that the value - judgment corresponded to unchallenged or proven facts . ORG further observed that , under section CARDINAL LAW , the plaintiff had to prove that the discrediting statement was untrue , unless the statement also amounted to an insult ; in the latter case , the offender had to prove the truth of the statement concerned . The question whether or not a statement constituted an unlawful interference with a person 's reputation could only be assessed by balancing all relevant circumstances .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant 's reproach of \u201c NORP - journalism \u201d had concerned an article published by the plaintiff , and had arisen on the occasion of a press conference concerning the plaintiff 's defamatory report about the applicant . The impugned statement had been an answer to a question put by CARDINAL of the journalists , and , in the circumstances , the ORG had no doubt that this statement only related to the particular article of CARDINAL DATE . In this context , the applicant 's statement was a value - judgment . In any event , there was no indication as to how the journalist had understood the applicant 's reproach \u201c NORP - journalism \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered further whether this value - judgment fell within the scope of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . The plaintiff could claim an injunction under this provision if , considering all circumstances , the plaintiff 's interests were not less important than the applicant 's . ORG found that the plaintiff had an interest not to be associated with ORG . The reproach \u201c NORP - journalism \u201d was close to a charge of criminal behaviour under LAW ( GPE ) . ORG also noted that the applicant 's statement was a reaction to an article published by the plaintiff which contained the assumption that the applicant was suffering from the immune deficiency syndrome , i.e. a contagious disease , which provokes fear and antipathy amongst the majority of the population . His indignation about the defamatory reporting might appear understandable but could not justify the reproach that the plaintiff 's way of reporting came close to criminal behaviour , in particular as he himself could have brought proceedings under section CARDINAL of LAW against the plaintiff . Balancing all circumstances , ORG concluded that the applicant 's interests did not outweigh the plaintiff 's . The right to freedom of expression could not justify such a serious attack on the plaintiff 's reputation . For the same reasons , the impugned statement could not be regarded as permissible political criticism , which is supposed to provoke or shock . ORG also noted that , having regard to the applicant 's submissions in the course of the proceedings , there was a risk that he would repeat the statement in question .", "CARDINAL . NORP This decision was served on the applicant 's counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the NORP Civil Code ( Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Anybody who , due to defamation , suffers real damage or loss of profit , may claim compensation .", "( CARDINAL ) The same applies if anyone is disseminating facts which jeopardise someone 's reputation , income or livelihood , the untruth of which was known or must have been known to him .
