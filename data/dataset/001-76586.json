The second applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national . Both applicants live in GPE ( GPE ) . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , and by PERSON PERSON , a university professor in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agents , PERSON , ORG , and , subsequently , PERSON , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The case concerns several provisions of the Law of CARDINAL DATE on restrictions on the secrecy of mail , post and telecommunications ( Gesetz PERSON Brief- , Post- PERSON ) , also called \u201c the G CARDINAL Act \u201d , as modified by LAW of DATE ( Verbrechensbek\u00e4mpfungsgesetz ) .", "CARDINAL . It notably concerns the extension of the powers of ORG ( PERSON ) with regard to the recording of telecommunications in the course of so - called strategic monitoring , as well as the use ( PERSON ) of personal data obtained thereby and their transmission to other authorities . Strategic monitoring is aimed at collecting information by intercepting telecommunications in order to identify and avert serious dangers facing GPE , such as an armed attack on its territory or the commission of international terrorist attacks and certain other serious offences ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below , paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . ) . In contrast , so - called individual monitoring , that is , the interception of telecommunications of specific persons , serves to avert or investigate certain grave offences which the persons monitored are suspected of planning or having committed .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is a freelance journalist who works for various NORP and foreign newspapers , radio and television stations on a regular basis . In particular , she investigates matters that are subject to the surveillance of ORG , notably armaments , preparations for war , drug and arms trafficking and money laundering . In order to carry out her investigations , she regularly travels to different countries in LOC and LOC and LOC , where she also meets the persons she wants to interview .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant , an employee of ORG , submitted that he took messages for the first applicant when she was on assignments , both from her telephone and from his own telephone . He then transmitted these messages to wherever she was .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG .", "CARDINAL . They alleged that certain provisions of LAW amending LAW disregarded their fundamental rights , notably the right to secrecy of telecommunications ( LAW , the right to self - determination in the sphere of information ( LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) , freedom of the press ( LAW ) and the right to effective recourse to the courts ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG submission , technological progress had made it possible to intercept telecommunications everywhere in the world and to collect personal data . Numerous telecommunications could be monitored , in the absence of any concrete suspicions , with the aid of catchwords which remained secret . Strategic monitoring could then be used in respect of individuals , preventing the press from carrying out effective investigations into sensitive areas covered by the LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having held a hearing , delivered its judgment on DATE ( running to CARDINAL pages ) . It found that the constitutional complaint lodged by the second applicant was inadmissible . The court noted that a constitutional complaint could be lodged directly against a statute if the person concerned could not know whether there had actually been an implementing measure applying the statute to him or her . The complainant , however , had to substantiate sufficiently his or her argument that his or her fundamental rights were likely to be breached by measures taken on the basis of the impugned statute .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that it was irrelevant that the applicants did not reside in GPE , because the impugned provisions were aimed at monitoring international telecommunications . However , it held that , unlike the first applicant , the second applicant had failed to substantiate sufficiently his claim that his rights under LAW were likely to be interfered with by measures based on the impugned provisions of the amended LAW . In the absence of any further details , the mere fact that he dealt with the first applicant \u2019s telecommunications in her absence was not sufficient to demonstrate this .", "CARDINAL . NORP Partly allowing the first applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , ORG held that certain provisions of LAW were incompatible or only partly compatible with the principles laid down in LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below , paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . ) . In particular , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first and second sentence , point CARDINAL , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) , first sentence , ( CARDINAL ) , first sentence , ( CARDINAL) , second sentence , and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , third sentence , of the LAW were found to be incompatible with LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) . It fixed a deadline of DATE for the legislature to bring the situation into line with the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new version of the G CARDINAL Act came into force ( BGBl . I DATE , pp . CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) and MONEY in its version as amended by LAW of DATE ceased to apply .", "CARDINAL . The Basic PERSON provides for the following fundamental rights , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Everyone shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech , writing and pictures and to obtain freely information from generally accessible sources . Freedom of the press and freedom of reporting on the radio and in films shall be guaranteed . There shall be no censorship .", "( CARDINAL ) These rights shall be subject to the limitations laid down by the provisions of the general laws and by statutory provisions aimed at protecting young people and to the obligation to respect personal honour . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Secrecy of mail , post and telecommunications shall be inviolable .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG may be ordered only pursuant to a statute . Where such restrictions are intended to protect the free democratic constitutional order or the existence or security of the GPE or of a Land , the statute may provide that the person concerned shall not be notified of the restriction and that review by the courts shall be replaced by a system of scrutiny by agencies and auxiliary agencies appointed by the people \u2019s elected representatives . \u201d", "\u201c ...", "( CARDINAL ) If a person \u2019s rights are violated by a public authority , he may have recourse to the courts . If no other jurisdiction has been established , the civil courts shall have jurisdiction . LAW , second sentence , remains unaffected by this paragraph . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The separation of legislative powers between the Federation and the ORG is laid down in Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW . Pursuant to LAW , in principle , have the right to legislate in so far as LAW does not confer legislative power on the Federation . Such legislative power is conferred on the Federation , in particular , in LAW :", "\u201c The Federation shall have exclusive power to legislate [ ausschlie\u00dfliche PERSON ] on :", "CARDINAL . NORP foreign affairs and defence , including the protection of civilians ;", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Being the statute envisaged by LAW , second sentence , of LAW ( cited above , paragraph CARDINAL ) , which provides for exceptions to the general rule of inviolability of telecommunications , the LAW DATE on restrictions on the secrecy of mail , post and telecommunications ( Gesetz PERSON Brief- , Post- PERSON ) , also called \u201c the G CARDINAL Act \u201d , lays down the conditions under which the authorities may introduce the restrictions referred to in that provision of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on DATE ( PERSON and Others v. GPE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , the ORG held that the provisions of the G CARDINAL Act of CARDINAL DATE , in its original version and as regards the monitoring of individuals , did not contravene the Convention . It found that the NORP legislature was justified in considering that the interference resulting from the legislation in question with the rights guaranteed by LAW was necessary in a NORP society within the meaning of paragraph CARDINAL of that Article . The ORG also considered that the remedies provided for in the G CARDINAL Act complied with the requirements of LAW .", "CARDINAL . LAW of DATE on the fight against crime amended the G CARDINAL Act . Among other things , it extended the range of subjects in respect of which \u201c strategic monitoring \u201d ( as opposed to monitoring of individuals ) could be carried out . In the original version of LAW , such monitoring was permitted only in order to detect and avert the danger of an armed attack on GPE and at that time was therefore merely focused on the GPE belonging to ORG . Furthermore , owing to technical progress it had become possible to identify the telephone connections ( ORG ) involved in an intercepted telecommunication .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the provisions of the G CARDINAL Act which either remained unchanged by LAW or were not contested in the present case , ORG the Federation and the L\u00e4nder ( Verfassungsschutzbeh\u00f6rden des Bundes und der L\u00e4nder ) , ORG ( PERSON ) and ORG were entitled to monitor and record telecommunications within their own sphere of activities ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the G CARDINAL Act ) . Monitoring of individuals was limited to serious threats to national security ( for example , high treason or threatening the democratic order ) and was permissible only if less intrusive means of investigation had no prospect of success or were considerably more difficult ( section CARDINAL of the G CARDINAL Act ) . As to strategic monitoring , only the head of ORG or his deputy were entitled to lodge an application for a surveillance order . The application had to be lodged in writing , had to describe and give reasons for the nature , scope and duration of the measure and had to explain that other means of carrying out the investigations either had no prospect of success or were considerably more difficult ( section CARDINAL of the G CARDINAL Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Restrictions on the secrecy of telecommunications were to be ordered by the Federal Minister assigned by the Chancellor or the highest authority of the L\u00e4nder ( in respect of applications by their Offices for ORG ) . The order was made in writing and specified the exact nature , scope and duration of the monitoring measure . The duration of the measure was to be limited to a maximum of DATE ; the execution of the measure could be prolonged for a maximum of DATE at a time as long as the statutory conditions for the order were met ( see section CARDINAL of the G CARDINAL Act ) .", "CARDINAL . The monitoring measures authorised were to be carried out under the responsibility of the requesting authority and under the supervision of a staff member qualified to hold judicial office . Monitoring had to be discontinued immediately if the conditions of the monitoring order were no longer met or the measure was no longer necessary ( section CARDINAL of the G CARDINAL Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provided that ORG was to verify whether the personal data obtained by measures taken under subsection CARDINAL of section CARDINAL were necessary to pursue the aims laid down in that subsection .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that in its present version section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) was incompatible with LAW , second sentence , of LAW . It found that the provision did not contain sufficient safeguards to guarantee that personal data which were not destroyed or deleted as being unnecessary for the purposes of ORG would be used only for the purposes which had justified their collection . Furthermore , the provision also failed to comply with the identification requirements flowing from LAW . In addition , there were insufficient safeguards to guarantee that ORG would only use such data as were relevant for the dangers listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . Such safeguards should also ensure that ORG would take into account the important concerns of nondisclosure of sources and confidentiality of editorial work as protected by the freedom of the press under LAW . The court ruled that , pending the entry into force of legislation in compliance with the LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) was to be applied only if the data were specially marked and were not used for purposes other than those listed in section MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . Monitoring measures were supervised by CARDINAL bodies , ORG and the so - called ORG ( see section CARDINAL of the G CARDINAL Act ) . At the relevant time , ORG consisted of CARDINAL members of parliament , including representatives of the opposition . The Federal Minister authorising monitoring measures had to inform the board DATE about the implementation of the G CARDINAL Act ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the G CARDINAL Act ) .", "CARDINAL . The G CARDINAL Commission consisted of a president who was qualified to hold judicial office and CARDINAL additional members who were appointed by ORG for the duration of CARDINAL legislative term and who were independent in the exercise of their functions ( see section ORG ) of the G CARDINAL Act ) . The Federal Minister authorising surveillance measures had to inform the ORG DATE about planned monitoring measures and had to obtain its consent ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the G CARDINAL Act ; see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . Moreover , the Federal Minister had to inform the Commission whether or not persons concerned by such measures had been notified of them . If the Commission decided that notification was necessary , the Federal Minister had to arrange for it to be given without undue delay ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , points CARDINAL and CARDINAL , in conjunction with section CARDINAL ) , first and second sentence , authorised the monitoring of wireless telecommunications , that is , telecommunications which were not effected via fixed telephone lines , but , for example , via satellite connections ( PERSON nicht leitungsgebundener Fernmeldeverkehrsbeziehungen ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence , provided that restrictions on the secrecy of telecommunications could be ordered by the competent Federal Minister with the approval of ORG , on an application by ORG , for international wireless telecommunications . Under the second sentence of that provision , such restrictions were permitted only in order to collect information about which knowledge was necessary for the timely identification and avoidance of certain dangers , namely :", "( CARDINAL ) an armed attack on GPE ;", "( CARDINAL ) the commission of international terrorist attacks in GPE ;", "( CARDINAL ) international arms trafficking within the meaning of ORG and prohibited external trade in goods , data - processing programmes and technologies in cases of considerable importance ;", "( CARDINAL ) the illegal importation of drugs in substantial quantities into the territory of GPE ;", "( CARDINAL ) the counterfeiting of money ( GPE ) committed abroad ;", "( CARDINAL ) the laundering of money in the context of the acts listed under points CARDINAL to CARDINAL .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , third sentence , restrictions on the secrecy of telecommunications could also be ordered for telecommunications via fixed telephone lines and for mail in order to identify and avert the dangers listed in section PERSON ) , second sentence , point CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that , pursuant to LAW , point CARDINAL , of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the federal legislature had exclusive legislative power to regulate the matters listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the amended LAW , as they concerned foreign affairs .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG took the view that allowing the monitoring of telecommunications in order to prevent the counterfeiting of money abroad , in accordance with point CARDINAL of section CARDINAL ) in its present wording , constituted a disproportionate interference with the secrecy of telecommunications as protected by LAW . It argued that this danger as such could not be considered to be as serious as an armed attack on ORG or any of the other dangers listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . The counterfeiting of money should therefore be included in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) only if it was restricted to cases in which it threatened the monetary stability of GPE . The court ruled that , pending the entry into force of legislation in compliance with the LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , point CARDINAL , was to be applied only if the counterfeiting of money abroad threatened monetary stability in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In practice , wireless telecommunications ( as opposed to telecommunications via fixed telephone lines ) comprised some CARDINAL per cent of the total volume of telecommunications at the relevant time . However , given technical progress , the volume of such telecommunications was expected to rise in the future .", "CARDINAL . Technically , telecommunications via satellite links ( with the satellites being positioned QUANTITY above the equator ) could be intercepted from sites in GPE if the signal reflected by the satellite ( the \u201c downlink \u201d ) covered the area in which the station was located . The area covered by the satellite beam depended on the satellite technology used . Whereas signals downlinked by older satellites often \u201c beamed \u201d across onethird of the LOC \u2019s surface , more modern satellites could concentrate their downlink on smaller areas . Signals could be intercepted everywhere within the area covered by the beam . International radio relay links ( PERSON ) could be intercepted from interception sites on NORP soil only if the radio relay transmission was effected within close proximity of these sites .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , ORG was only authorised to carry out monitoring measures with the aid of catchwords ( ORG ) which served , and were suitable for , the investigation of the dangers described in the monitoring order ( first sentence ) . The second sentence of that provision prohibited the catchwords from containing distinguishing features ( ORG ) allowing the interception of specific telecommunications . However , this rule did not apply to telephone connections situated abroad if it could be ruled out that connections concerning NORP nationals or NORP companies were deliberately being monitored ( third sentence ) . The catchwords had to be listed in the monitoring order ( fourth sentence ) . The execution of the monitoring process as such had to be recorded in TIME by technical means and was subject to supervision by ORG ( fifth sentence ) . The data contained in these minutes could be used only for the purposes of reviewing data protection and had to be deleted at DATE following their recording ( sixth and seventh sentences ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence , provided that personal data ( personenbezogene ORG ) obtained through the interception of telecommunications could only serve the prevention , investigation and prosecution of offences listed in LAW and in certain other provisions , notably of LAW . These offences included , in particular , high treason against the peace or security of the ORG , crimes threatening the democratic order , the external security of the ORG or the security of the allied forces based in GPE , the formation of terrorist associations , murder , manslaughter , robbery , the forgery of payment cards or cheques , fraud relating to economic subsidies , infiltration of foreigners and the production , importation and trafficking of illegal drugs . Personal data thus obtained could be used only if the person concerned was either subject to individual monitoring under LAW or if there were factual indications ( tats\u00e4chliche PERSON ) for suspecting a person of planning , committing or having committed one of the offences mentioned above . This catalogue of offences for the investigation of which knowledge obtained by strategic monitoring could be used was considerably enlarged by the amendment of MONEY in issue .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , the obligation on ORG to inform ORG of its findings obtained by strategic monitoring , including personal data , under section CARDINAL of ORG remained unaffected .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , in its present version , failed to comply with ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of LAW . The provision did not contain sufficient safeguards to guarantee that the duty of ORG to report to ORG , which included the transmission of personal data , would be performed solely for the purposes which had justified the collection of the data ( GPE ) . Furthermore , the provision failed to comply with the identification requirements ( NORP ) flowing from LAW . Ensuring that personal data were not used for illegal purposes was possible only if it remained discernible that the data concerned had been obtained by means of an interference with the secrecy of telecommunications . Likewise , there were no safeguards ensuring that ORG did not keep or use the personal data transmitted to them for purposes other than those listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . The court ruled that , pending the entry into force of legislation in compliance with the LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , was to be applied only if the personal data contained in the report to ORG were marked and remained bound up with the purposes which had justified their collection .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence , provided that the data obtained in the circumstances described in subsection CARDINAL of section CARDINAL had to be transmitted to the Offices for the Protection of the LAW and of the L\u00e4nder , to ORG , to ORG ( GPE ) , to the public ORG offices and to certain police services for the purposes laid down in subsection CARDINAL of section CARDINAL in so far as this was necessary for the recipient authorities to carry out their duties .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , the decision to transmit data was to be taken by a staff member who was qualified to hold judicial office .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the federal legislature \u2019s exclusive legislative power under LAW , point CARDINAL , of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to regulate matters concerning foreign affairs also covered the transmission to other authorities of information obtained by ORG in the performance of its tasks as provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the amended LAW . The federal legislature merely had to provide guarantees that the further use of the data did not disregard the primary function of the monitoring measures .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further found that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) was not fully compatible with ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of LAW . It held that LAW did not prohibit the transmission to the authorities listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence , of information which was relevant for the prevention and investigation of criminal offences . This finding was not called into question by the fact that the initial collection of data by means of the random interception of telecommunications in order to prevent or investigate offences , without any prior suspicion of a specific offence being planned or having been committed , would breach LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in the opinion of ORG , the transmission of data under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence , in its present version , disproportionately interfered with the right to secrecy of telecommunications and freedom of the press . The transmission of data constituted a further serious interference with the secrecy of telecommunications , because criminal investigations could be instituted against persons concerned by the interception of telecommunications which had been carried out without any prior suspicion of an offence . Consequently , such transmission was proportionate only if it served the protection of an important legal interest and if there was a sufficient factual basis for the suspicion that criminal offences were being planned or had been committed .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence , read in conjunction with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , did not fully comply with these requirements .", "CARDINAL . The catalogue of offences in respect of which the transmission of data was permitted also included less serious offences such as fraud relating to economic subsidies . Moreover , the impugned provision authorised the transmission of data in cases in which there were merely factual indications for the suspicion that one of the offences listed in that provision had been committed or was even only being planned . The transmission of data for the investigation of an offence which had already been committed was to be authorised only if the factual basis for the transmission was the same as that required by LAW . Article LAW provided , however , that interferences with the secrecy of telecommunications in order to investigate crimes required the presence of specific facts \u2013 as opposed to mere factual indications \u2013 warranting the suspicion that the person concerned had committed an offence listed in that provision . As regards the transmission of data for the prevention of crime , the combination of the following elements led to a disproportionate interference with the fundamental rights affected : the fact that mere factual indications were sufficient , that the mere planning of an offence could suffice , and that transmission could also be justified in the case of less serious offences .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further found that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , was likewise not compatible with the right to secrecy of telecommunications . It considered it unnecessary to entrust the decision on transmission of data to an independent body . However , there was no requirement to record in TIME the transmission or the destruction or deletion of the data . This rendered effective supervision of the transmission of the data impossible .", "CARDINAL . ORG ruled that , pending the entry into force of legislation in compliance with the LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence , could be applied provided that data were only transmitted if specific facts aroused the suspicion that offences listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) had been committed . Furthermore , the transmission had to be recorded in TIME .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) regulated the procedure for destruction of the data obtained by strategic monitoring .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provided that if the data obtained in the circumstances set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) were no longer necessary to achieve the purposes listed in that provision and if they did not have to be transmitted to other authorities pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , they had to be destroyed and deleted from the files under the supervision of a staff member who was qualified to hold judicial office ( first sentence ) . The destruction and deletion had to be recorded in TIME ( second sentence ) . It was necessary to verify DATE whether the conditions for destruction or deletion were met ( third sentence ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provided that the recipient authorities were likewise to verify whether they needed the data transmitted to them in order to achieve the aims laid down in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( first sentence ) . If this was not the case , they also had to destroy the data immediately ( second sentence ) . The destruction could be dispensed with if separation of the data from other information which was necessary for the fulfilment of the tasks set was impossible or could only be carried out through unjustifiable effort ; the use of such data was prohibited ( third sentence ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence , provided that personal data obtained by means of monitoring measures pursuant to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL about a person involved in the telecommunications monitored had to be destroyed if they were no longer necessary for the purposes listed in the LAW and could no longer be of significance for an examination by the courts of the legality of the measure . The destruction had to be carried out under the supervision of a person qualified to hold judicial office . Pursuant to section DATE ) , second sentence , the destruction had to be recorded in TIME . It was necessary to examine DATE whether personal data obtained could be destroyed ( third sentence ) . Access to data which were merely kept for the purpose of judicial review of the monitoring measure had to be blocked ( fourth sentence ) . They could only be used for that purpose ( fifth sentence ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the provisions on the destruction of data laid down in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , second and third sentences , and section DATE ) complied with LAW . The provisions had , however , to be interpreted so as not to frustrate judicial review of monitoring measures . This meant that data could only be destroyed DATE after the person concerned had been notified that monitoring measures had been taken .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG considered section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) to be incompatible with LAW . It was necessary for the recipient authorities to mark the data as having been obtained by means of the interception of telecommunications . Otherwise , following verification that the information obtained was relevant for the tasks of the authorities concerned , personal data could be saved in a manner which made it impossible to identify them as resulting from the strategic monitoring of telecommunications . The restrictions on the permitted use of these data pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) would thereby be undermined . The court ruled that , pending the entry into force of legislation in compliance with LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) could be applied provided that the data were marked as described .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence , provided that ORG or the recipient authorities had to inform the persons monitored about the restriction imposed on the secrecy of telecommunications as soon as such notification could occur without jeopardising the achievement of the aim pursued by the restriction and the use of the data . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , no notification was given if the data obtained had been destroyed within DATE after their receipt by ORG or the recipient authorities .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered the restriction on the duty of notification as such , as laid down in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence , to be compatible with LAW . By virtue of LAW , first and second sentences , taken in conjunction with LAW , third sentence , of LAW , no notification had to be given if this served to protect ORG or its democratic order or if disclosure of the information obtained or the methods used to this end threatened the fulfilment of the tasks of the authorities concerned .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , violated Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . There were no safeguards precluding the data from being used before their destruction within DATE . The mere destruction of the data within DATE did not , however , justify dispensing with the duty of notification irrespective of the prior use of the data .", "CARDINAL . The court ruled that , pending the entry into force of legislation in compliance with the LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) could be applied provided that the data had not been used before their destruction .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provided for supervision of the monitoring measures by an independent body , the so - called ORG .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence , the competent Federal Minister was to inform ORG on a DATE basis about the measures he had ordered to restrict the secrecy of telecommunications before such measures were implemented .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Minister could , however , order the execution of the measure before informing ORG if there was a risk that a delay might frustrate the purpose of the measure ( second sentence of section MONEY ) ) . The ORG gave a decision of its own motion or further to complaints contesting the legality and necessity of monitoring measures ( third sentence ) . Monitoring orders which the Commission deemed illegal or unnecessary had to be immediately revoked by the Minister ( fourth sentence ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , in its present wording , was incompatible with LAW . It failed to provide in a sufficiently clear manner that supervision by ORG covered the whole process of obtaining and using the data ( including measures taken under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL) ) , and not only the monitoring orders by the competent Minister . The court ruled that , pending the entry into force of legislation in compliance with the LAW , the provision in question was only to be applied if the ORG \u2019s supervisory powers extended to measures taken under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL) .", "CARDINAL .
