On DATE the applicant left his home in GPE ) , where he had been living with his parents , for the GPE . He went to the GPE to visit family but overstayed his tourist visa , which was valid until DATE . During his stay in the GPE he lived with his brother and the latter \u2019s family in GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to an official report ( ambtsbericht ) drawn up by ORG ( Algemene Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) dated DATE , information provided by a generally reliable source indicated that a certain NORP national residing in the GPE , had sworn allegiance to PERSON , PERSON in GPE and ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , and that he was trying to obtain a firearm with which to attack the GPE police . The information also contained CARDINAL telephone numbers used by that person . The official report further stated that it appeared from the ORG \u2019s own investigation that the person was the applicant , that he was not registered in the GPE and that he did not have a valid residence permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed acts in preparation of terrorist offences and placed in police custody . The house where he had been staying was searched by the police , who found and seized notes containing , inter alia , instructions on how to make an improvised explosive device ( IED ) and a written pledge to ORG . Furthermore , the police seized a computer and found on the applicant \u2019s ORG account conversations in which he had made enquiries into how to make IEDs , projecting himself as a supporter of ORG and expressing his wish to join the jihad in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE investigating authorities sent a request for mutual legal assistance ( rechtshulpverzoek ) to the competent NORP authorities in connection with the criminal investigation against the applicant , requesting , inter alia , the examination of a number of bank accounts and bank cards . The request contained the number of the applicant \u2019s national identity card and specified that the criminal investigation concerned suspicion of ( preparation of ) murder with a terrorist motive , participation in a criminal organisation with a terrorist aim , preparation of a terrorist offence , and financing of terrorism . On DATE a supplementary request was sent to the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s remand in custody was extended . Criminal proceedings against him commenced on charges of several preparatory acts of terrorism , including the criminal offence defined in LAW ( PERSON ) , namely the acquisition of information and know - how in preparation of the commission of a terrorist offence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE several articles , written in NORP , LANGUAGE and LANGUAGE , about the dismantling of a terrorist cell and arrest of its members in Selwane were published on Internet news sites . Those articles also mentioned the arrest in the GPE of a NORP living there , who was planning attacks in the GPE and who had links with that terrorist cell . Some of the articles also stated that information provided by the NORP intelligence agency ( ORG of the National Territory \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to the ORG had led to the person \u2019s arrest in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( rechtbank ) acquitted the applicant of all charges . It found that his intent to commit terrorist offences had not been proven in the light of evidence presented by him showing that his chat messages had been meant to impress and show off . His acquittal was reported by various media outlets in the GPE . CARDINAL of those reports stated that , according to his lawyer , the applicant intended to apply for asylum in the GPE , as he feared that , in the event of his removal to GPE , he would be detained in GPE as a terror suspect . The public prosecutor ( officier van justitie ) appealed against the acquittal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE quashed the impugned judgment , convicted the applicant of having committed the offence under LAW , and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant \u2019s intent to acquire information and know - how in order to use it in the commission of a terrorist offence was found proven on the basis of numerous chat messages and written notes . Referring to the systematic and radical nature of those messages and given the relatively long period during which the applicant had been engaged in the internet conversations , ORG dismissed the argument that he had merely been trying to impress and show off .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently lodged an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s appeal inadmissible , providing summary reasoning in application of section CARDINALa of ORG ( Wet op de rechterlijke organisatie ) .", "CARDINAL .

NORP In support of his claim , the applicant referred to various press articles about the criminal proceedings against him in the GPE , as well as to several Internet news articles written in NORP , NORP and LANGUAGE about a terrorist cell in PERSON \u2012 the town where he had been living before going to the GPE \u2012 which had been dismantled by the NORP authorities in DATE . Some articles also mentioned that a member of that terrorist cell who was residing in the GPE had been arrested . According to the applicant , they had been referring to him ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Although the applicant denied that he had any contacts with this cell , he stated that because of these allegations he will be associated with these NORP suspects of terrorism .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submitted that he had learned from his family in GPE that CARDINAL acquaintances from his place of birth , LOC named \u201c QUANTITY and \u201c PERSON \u201d , had been arrested by the NORP security service in DATE or DATE . According to the applicant , this was a strong indication that he too was a target of the NORP security service .", "CARDINAL .

The asylum application was rejected by the Deputy Minister on CARDINAL DATE . In addition , an entry ban ( inreisverbod ) of DATE was imposed on the applicant , the Deputy Minister holding that he posed a threat to public safety on account of his criminal conviction and information from the GPE security service that he posed a danger to national security . Furthermore , and referring to the person - specific official report of DATE , the Deputy Minister held that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that he faced a real and personal risk of treatment contrary to LAW . The applicant was not being searched for by the NORP authorities , nor had he been charged with any criminal offences there . The Deputy Minister found that the applicant \u2019s fear of being arrested , tortured and detained was based on general reports and assumptions . The Deputy Minister referred to earlier experiences with young NORP men who had stood trial in the GPE on charges related to NORP terrorism and who had been removed to GPE . None of them had encountered any problems from the side of the NORP authorities that could be regarded as relevant from an asylum - law perspective . On this point , the Deputy Minister referred to an article published on DATE in the GPE DATE newspaper ORG about the experiences of CARDINAL convicted members of the NORP terrorist \u201c NORP group \u201d ( ORG ) who , after having served their sentence in the GPE , had been removed to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal ( beroep ) with ORG , submitting in addition to his previous submissions , inter alia , a copy of an email from his NORP attorney , ORG , and extracts from a NORP police report dated DATE concerning a criminal investigation in respect of several persons , including CARDINAL \u201c PERSON ( previously referred to by the applicant as \u201c PERSON \u201d ) . The police report stated that PERSON was the person behind the radicalisation of his neighbour ( the applicant ) , who was being detained in the GPE in connection with terrorism . It further stated that , after the applicant \u2019s departure to the GPE , they had remained in contact by telephone and that in their conversations , the applicant had indicated his wish to buy a firearm , and that he intended to learn how to make explosives for use in a terrorist act in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE , sitting in GPE , dismissed the appeal and upheld the impugned decision . As regards the applicant \u2019s reliance on LAW , it held as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . [ The appellant ] argues that on return he will be at a real risk of a violation of LAW . He fears that he will be detained and ill - treated because \u2013 due to media reports \u2013 he is being linked by the NORP authorities to terrorist groups and terrorist activities . On this point [ the appellant ] refers to various documents . In addition , [ the appellant ] argues that [ the Deputy Minister ] was not allowed to base his decision on the person - specific official report of ORG as insufficient due care had been taken in drawing it up and , in addition , as it lacks clarity .", "CARDINAL . The court states at the outset that it is in principle for [ the appellant ] to make out a plausible case that he is running a real risk of a violation of LAW . [ The appellant ] has submitted a number of documents in substantiation of his claim . In addition , [ the Deputy Minister ] has met [ the appellant ] halfway in the discharge of the burden of proof which rests on the latter by having ORG conduct an investigation which has resulted in a person - specific official report . The court will discuss below [ the appellant \u2019s ] documents and the person - specific official report of ORG .", "CARDINAL . [ The appellant ] has submitted media reports about a terrorist cell that intended to commit attacks in the GPE and about a NORP man , [ name of appellant ] , who was arrested in DATE in the GPE on suspicion of terrorism and convicted by ORG . [ The appellant ] also submitted documents about a NORP Dutchman who had been interrogated and tortured in GPE and referred to information from ORG about torture and ill - treatment of detainees and unfair proceedings for terrorist suspects in GPE . In addition , [ the appellant ] has submitted an email message from his NORP lawyer about the negative attention which [ the applicant ] will attract upon return and a copy of ( part of ) an official report of the police in GPE in the terrorism case of PERSON in which [ the appellant \u2019s ] name is mentioned . In addition , [ the appellant ] has submitted part of a judgment of the [ Tribunal Correctionnel de GPE ] concerning PERSON , who is suspected of terrorist activities and [ the appellant ] claims that this person has been convicted again in GPE for the same set of facts .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . In so far as it appears from the documents submitted by [ the appellant ] that he is known as a terror suspect or has been convicted of facts relating to terrorism , the court considers that this has already been found credible by [ the Deputy Minister ] . The circumstance that , because of media reports about this , [ the appellant ] is known in the GPE and GPE does not mean that therefore he runs a real risk of serious harm when he returns to GPE . [ The appellant ] fears that , because of being known [ by those authorities ] , he will upon return be arrested and ill - treated by the NORP authorities , but for substantiation purposes has not submitted documents concerning [ himself ] . [ The appellant ] has pointed to general information about the treatment of detainees in GPE and about the proceedings in respect of terrorist suspects , but this information is only relevant if it is plausible that [ the appellant ] upon return will be arrested or prosecuted for terrorism . In the court \u2019s opinion , [ the Deputy Minister ] has not unjustly adopted the position that [ the appellant ] has not made out a plausible case . In the email message from [ the appellant \u2019s ] NORP lawyer submitted by [ the appellant ] , this lawyer reports that [ the appellant ] will be tried when transferred to GPE , even though he has already been tried in the GPE , and refers to CARDINAL decisions in which the same person was convicted both in GPE and in GPE for the same facts . This means that the email message contains no more than a statement from [ the appellant \u2019s ] lawyer , without specific further substantiation relating to [ the appellant ] from which it follows that [ the appellant ] will be prosecuted in GPE . Reference is only made to a case of another person convicted in GPE , but no documents have been submitted showing that this person has been convicted of the same facts in GPE . Nor have documents been submitted from which it can be deduced that [ the appellant ] finds himself in the same situation . It can further not be concluded from the copy of ( a part of ) a report of the NORP police , submitted by [ the appellant ] , that [ the appellant ] is being searched for in GPE as a suspect of terrorism . As pointed out rightly by [ the Deputy Minister ] , the document only contains information about the activities of the suspect PERSON , including the influencing of [ the appellant ] , but it does not appear from the document that [ the appellant ] is involved in any criminal proceedings . However , triggered by what [ the appellant ] has presented about the terror cell dismantled in DATE , of which PERSON was a member , [ the Deputy Minister ] asked ORG for a person - specific official report , which will be discussed below .", "CARDINAL . According to the constant case - law of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) ( including the ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG : NL : RVS:CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , an official report from the Minister of ORG about the situation in a country is an expert opinion for the Deputy Minister for the exercise of the latter \u2019s powers . If it provides information in an impartial , objective and transparent manner with an indication , in so far as this is responsible , of the sources from which this information is derived , the Deputy Minister may , in making a decision , assume the correctness of this information , unless there are concrete reasons for doubting that accuracy . As regards person - specific official reports , ORG has considered that , if a person - specific official report contradicts the asylum claim which it concerns , it is for the alien concerned to refute the official report .", "CARDINAL . [ The appellant \u2019s ] argument that [ the Deputy Minister ] was not allowed to base his decision on the person - specific official report of ORG because insufficient due care had been taken in drawing it up , fails . On DATE the Deputy Minister carried out a REK - check , which entails [ the Deputy Minister ] assuring himself that the person - specific official report has been drawn up with due care and is comprehensible . The outcome of the REK check was that this could not be concluded . Subsequently , ORG was asked for further clarification , [ in response ] to which ORG supplemented , by letter of CARDINAL DATE , the person - specific official report . On DATE a fresh REK check was carried out and it was concluded that the person - specific official report was comprehensible but that , procedurally , due care had not been exercised in preparing the report , as the investigation in GPE had taken place without using a trusted local advisor ( vertrouwenspersoon ) . Although in the case of an asylum application this falls short of due care , the court finds that in this case [ the Deputy Minister ] did not have to see reason for not taking into account in the decision making the person - specific official report of ORG , as [ the Deputy Minister ] has given sufficient reasons for holding that the interests of [ the appellant ] were not harmed by this failure to exercise due care . [ The Deputy Minister ] has indicated that the use of a trusted local advisor is to ensure that the authorities of the country of origin are not informed of the alien \u2019s stay in the GPE and of his asylum application , whereas in this case it can be assumed that the NORP authorities , due to reports in the media there , are already aware [ of this circumstance ] . On this point [ the Deputy Minister ] has referred to a number of media reports . [ The appellant ] has not argued or further substantiated that that knowledge by the NORP authorities will lead to problems . Also for the remainder , [ the appellant ] has not indicated why his interests would have been harmed by the lack of due care in the preparation of the person - specific official report .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . NORP The person - specific official report of ORG states , inter alia , that the members of the terrorist cell dismantled on DATE , which is mentioned in the coverage referred to by [ the appellant ] , were all arrested on that date . This group does not include TIME or PERSON as mentioned by the applicant , but these names are not necessarily the names of the persons . The group does include an LOC and a B. , but not with the family name PERSON In addition , the person - specific official report states that these persons were still in detention at the time of the investigation and that neither [ the appellant ] nor these persons were mentioned by name in press reports about the dismantled terror cell . It is indeed mentioned in press reports that a NORP staying in the GPE has been arrested in cooperation with the local authorities . Finally , it has been included in the person - specific official report that at the time of the investigation [ the appellant ] was not being searched for by the NORP authorities in connection with the criminal investigation into the dismantled terror cell , that at the time of the investigation no charge had been brought against [ the appellant ] and that at the time of the investigation [ the appellant ] was not being searched for by the NORP authorities in connection with a criminal investigation into other facts .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . [ The appellant \u2019s ] argument that [ the Deputy Minister ] was not allowed to base his decision on the person - specific official report of ORG because it contains unclear points , also fails . In the opinion of the court , [ the appellant ] has not presented any concrete arguments for [ the court ] to doubt the correctness of the person - specific official report . [ The appellant ] has argued that it is unclear to what extent the [ NORP ] investigating judge ( onderzoeksrechter ) is competent to make statements about [ the appellant ] . In the first place , this mere remark does not comprise a concrete argument as mentioned above . Irrespective of this , the court considers that , on the basis of the underlying materials of the person - specific official report which the court has consulted , it can be assumed that the investigating judge in question is competent and able to provide the information given . Also the mere assertion of [ the appellant ] that it is odd that the investigating judge , who apparently holds all information on terrorism cases , is not asked whether [ the appellant ] is being searched for , is not a concrete argument in the above sense . Moreover , it follows from question CARDINAL in the letter from [ the Deputy Minister ] to ORG of DATE that the ORG has been asked both whether [ the appellant ] is being searched for by the NORP authorities in connection with the criminal investigation into the arrested terror cell and whether [ the appellant ] is being searched for by the NORP authorities in connection with a criminal investigation into other facts . Also , the unclear assertions made by [ the appellant ] about the names of the persons arrested , mentioned in the person - specific official report and the notion \u2018 at the time of the investigation\u2019 offer no concrete reasons to doubt the accuracy of the person - specific official report . The term \u2018 at the time of the investigation\u2019 can not be read otherwise than that the question has been answered by the investigating judge on the basis of the state of affairs at the time of the investigation . Incidentally , [ the appellant ] has not argued that the state of affairs would be different at a different ( later ) point in time . As to the names of the arrested persons , the person - specific official report already states that the names may also be different . Also on this point the court sees no reason for doubting the correctness [ of the official report ] . As the document from the criminal case file submitted by [ the appellant ] , which possibly refers to him , is of DATE than the person - specific official report of ORG , it is not plausible that this reference has given the NORP authorities cause to open a criminal investigation against [ the appellant ] . This is [ therefore ] not a concrete reason for doubting the correctness and completeness of the person - specific official report .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the person - specific report of ORG , [ the Deputy Minister ] has also referred to experiences made with young NORP men ( including members of the NORP group ) who had been the subject of a terrorism trial in the GPE and/or constituted a danger to NORP national security in connection with involvement in NORP terrorism and/or jihad and for that reason [ had been ] returned to GPE . According to [ the Deputy Minister ] , no signals to be taken seriously have been received from them that , upon their return , they had encountered problems , relevant from an asylum - law perspective , from the side of the NORP authorities . The court notes that [ the appellant ] has not rebutted this in a substantiated manner and finds that [ the Deputy Minister ] has correctly taken this into account in his assessment . In this respect , the court refers to the ruling of the [ Administrative Jurisdiction ] Division of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG : NL : PERSON ) . [ The appellant ] has not established that the NORP authorities will act differently in his case .", "CARDINAL . The court concludes that it follows from the person - specific official report of ORG that [ the appellant ] is not being searched for by the NORP authorities in connection with the criminal investigation concerning the dismantled terror cell or other facts and that [ the appellant ] has not put forward any concrete arguments for [ the court ] to doubt the correctness of this information . Nor can it be deduced from the documents submitted by [ the appellant ] that he is being searched for by the NORP authorities and/or will be detained and tortured upon return . This can also not be inferred from previous experiences in similar cases . Thus the fear alleged by [ the appellant ] upon return has not been made plausible . In view of this , [ the Deputy Minister ] rightly took the view that [ the appellant ] has not established that , upon return , he will run a real risk of a violation of LAW . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged a further appeal ( hoger beroep ) against ORG decision with ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) . He also requested a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) , namely to stay his removal pending the outcome of the further appeal . Neither a further appeal nor a request for a provisional measure has automatic suspensive effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the ORG to apply an interim measure under LAW , in order to stay his removal to GPE . The determination of that request was adjourned by ORG on DATE and the Government were requested to submit factual information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request for a provisional measure by revoking the order to expel the applicant to GPE scheduled for DATE . In view of that decision , the ORG decided on DATE to suspend until further notice the determination of his Rule CARDINAL request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s further appeal . It held that under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) , no further reasoning was called for , as the arguments submitted did not raise any questions requiring determination in the interest of legal unity , legal development or legal protection in the general sense . No further appeal lay against this ruling . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for a provisional measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer was informed that the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE had been scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG applied Rule CARDINAL for DATE and requested further factual information from the Government . The requested information was received on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government informed the ORG that in the context of the criminal proceedings against the applicant information had been exchanged between the NORP and the NORP authorities through a legal assistance request submitted by the NORP authorities on CARDINAL DATE and a supplementary request on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . They added that ORG ( Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst ) , in establishing that there was no Article CARDINAL risk for the applicant were he to be removed to GPE , had taken into account that the NORP authorities had been apprised of the criminal proceedings and that they were likely to be aware of the outcome thereof . The Government added that the NORP authorities had not sought the applicant \u2019s extradition . The Government had not sought specific guarantees from the NORP authorities as they took the view that the applicant \u2019s removal would not result in a violation of LAW . The authentic and valid ID - card held by the applicant was sufficient for him to be accepted onto a flight to GPE . No special procedure had been put in place for his removal , but during his transfer he would be accompanied by officers of ORG ( ORG ) and after arrival he would be handed over to the authorities at the destination airport . The Government lastly informed the ORG that they had not been able to obtain further information regarding the criminal proceedings against the members of the terrorist cell which had been dismantled in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the ORG that , through his NORP attorney ORG , he had been able to obtain a copy of the judgment by which PERSON and CARDINAL others had been convicted of , inter alia , the establishment of a terrorist group loyal to the NORP ORG intended to commit terrorist activities against the public order of GPE . PERSON had been sentenced to DATE imprisonment . The judgment in LANGUAGE , which runs to CARDINAL pages , contains the following passage :", "\u201c PERSON has several connections with jihadis . In particular , he recruits young men in his area for his terrorist organisation .
