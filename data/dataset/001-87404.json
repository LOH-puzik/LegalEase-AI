In its order for reference , ORG observed that in several member States of ORG , such as GPE , the symbol of left - wing parties is the red star or the hammer and sickle . Therefore , the question arose whether a provision in CARDINAL member ORG of ORG prohibiting the use of the symbols of the international labour movement on pain of criminal prosecution was discriminatory , when such a display in another member ORG did not give rise to any sanction .", "CARDINAL .

GPE concerning the restriction of the political activities and the freedom of political debate of police officers , the ORG passed its judgment on DATE stating that \u2018 the objective that the critical position of the police in society should not be compromised as a result of weakening the political neutrality of its members is an objective that can be accepted in line with democratic principles .

Article CARDINAL orders the punishment of distributing , using in front of a large public gathering and exhibiting in public symbols that were used by political dictatorial regimes ; such regimes committed unlawful acts en masse and violated fundamental human rights . All of these symbols represent the despotism of the ORG , symbolise negative political ideas realised throughout the history of GPE in DATE , and are expressly prohibited by LAW , which imposes upon everyone the obligation to resist such activities ...", "Using the symbols in the way prohibited by LAW can cause a reasonable feeling of menace or fear based on the concrete experience of people \u2013 including their various communities \u2013 who suffered injury in the past , as such symbols represent the risk of having such inhuman acts repeated in connection with the totalitarian ideas concerned .", "In the opinion of ORG , if DATE in addition to the subject thus protected by criminal law \u2013 the protection of other constitutional values can not be achieved by other means , criminal - law protection itself is not considered to be disproportionate , provided that it is necessary to have protection against the use of such symbols . Whether or not it is necessary to have such protection in a NORP society depends on the nature of the restriction , its social and historical context , and its impact on the persons affected .", "Based on the above , in the present case , the statute under review serves the purpose of protecting other constitutional values in addition to the protected subject defined in criminal law . Such values are the democratic nature of the ORG under the rule of law mentioned in LAW , the prohibition defined in LAW , as well as the requirement specified in LAW , stating that all people shall be treated by the law as persons of equal dignity ...", "Allowing an unrestricted , open and public use of the symbols concerned would , in the present historical situation , seriously offend all persons committed to democracy who respect the human dignity of persons and thus condemn the ideologies of hatred and aggression , and would offend in particular those who were persecuted by NORP and communism .

The individuals who suffered severely and their relatives live among us . The use of such symbols recalls the recent past , together with the threats of that time , the inhuman sufferings , the deportations and the deadly ideologies .", "In the opinion of ORG , it is indeed a measure with a view to the protection of democratic society \u2013 and therefore not unconstitutional \u2013 if , in the present historical situation , the ORG prohibits certain conduct contrary to democracy , connected to the use of the particular symbols of totalitarian regimes , their dissemination , their use in front of a large public gathering , and a public exhibition ...", "The constitutional assessment and evaluation of criminally sanctioning separate violations of the values protected by DATE namely , public order and the dignity of communities committed to the values of democracy DATE could possibly result in a different conclusion ; however , since the use of totalitarian symbols violates both values jointly and simultaneously , there is a cumulative and synergic effect reinforced by the present - day impact of recent historical events .", "ORG holds that the historical experience of GPE and the danger to the constitutional values threatening NORP society reflected in the potential publicly to demonstrate activities based on the ideologies of former regimes , convincingly , objectively and reasonably justify the prohibition of such activities and the use of the criminal law to combat them . The restriction on freedom of expression found in LAW , in the light of the historical background , is considered to be a response to a pressing social need .", "According to ORG , in the present historical situation , there is no effective legal tool other than the tools of criminal law and penal sanction ( ultima ratio ) against the use of the symbols specified in LAW ; the subjects committing the crime and , in particular , the CARDINAL specific types of conduct in committing the crime , require restriction for the protection of the aims represented by the constitutional values .
