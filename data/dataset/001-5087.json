The second applicant was until DATE the managing director of the first applicant . The third applicant was at all material times the director of the first applicant . The second and third applicants are NORP citizens , born in DATE and DATE respectively . The second applicant lives in GPE , GPE , and the third applicant lives in GPE , GPE .", "The applicants are all represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "A number of companies and partnerships collectively known as \u201c PERSON \u201d had been engaged in the operation of investment schemes since DATE . However , it was only in DATE that ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , the responsible regulatory authority for the investment and other sectors , issued PERSON with a first licence . The ORG renewed the licence in DATE and in DATE .", "PERSON collapsed in DATE with substantial losses to investors .", "From DATE there was substantial and compelling evidence that PERSON investment schemes were fraudulent . In the applicants ' submission , the ORG had been advised of the dangers to investors posed by PERSON investment activities . The sources included ORG and the ORG . Of particular importance to the applicants is the fact that in DATE and DATE ORG drew the ORG 's attention to the existence of a relationship between PERSON and GPE incorporated company , ORG . The first applicant provided ORG with a professional administration service . None of the applicants was ever contacted by the ORG at that stage about their association with ORG .", "No action was taken by the ORG on receipt of the negative reports on PERSON and , as stated above , the company 's licence was renewed in DATE and in DATE .", "The ORG 's decision to grant and then renew the PERSON licence in the face of the evidence against the company was severely criticised in a report of ORG ( \u201c PCA \u201d ) published on DATE . The ORG found that PERSON would not have continued in business beyond DATE if it had been properly regulated by the ORG . The ORG 's conclusion was that the ORG was guilty of \u201c significant maladministration \u201d .", "The ORG 's handling of PERSON was also criticised in a report submitted in DATE to the Secretary of ORG by ORG appointed under LAW DATE . In the ORG ' conclusion , the ORG \u201c did not demonstrate in relation to PERSON the characteristics of a competent regulatory authority . \u201d Although there was some criticism of the applicants in this report , there was no finding that they had been dishonest as regards knowledge of the origins of investors ' funds .", "DATE and DATE the main associate of PERSON ( GPE ) stood trial on and was convicted of various charges relating to the conduct of the investment scheme .", "Following a recommendation in the ORG 's report to the effect that investors in PERSON be compensated , the ORG set up a scheme under which investors who agreed to assign to the ORG their rights in relation to their investments with PERSON would receive compensation . MONEY of investors accepted this offer with the result that the ORG became the principal beneficiary of any litigation aimed at recovering their investment funds .", "ORG ( \u201c BCI \u201d ) , a company registered in GPE , belonged to the PERSON group and held investors ' monies in funds identified as Portfolios DATE , CARDINAL and DATE . On DATE ORG ordered ORG 's liquidation and appointed PERSON and NORP as joint liquidators . On DATE as joint liquidator and , on the same date , both PERSON and J. were also appointed as joint receivers and managers of the portfolios cited , as well as of any other such funds promoted by ORG .", "The applicants insist that ORG was never placed in receivership and that the powers of PERSON and J. to act as Receivers were limited to the scope stated in the court 's Order , which was restated by ORG as including powers to :", "\u201c ... issue and prosecute ... in the name of [ BCI ] and / or in their own names in their capacity as Receivers ( whether on behalf of all or any of the investors or otherwise ) any proceedings in any jurisdiction which the ORG may think expedient or desirable in relation to the collection , recovery and management of any of the assets comprised in the receivership or otherwise in relation to the receivership ... . \u201d", "The representatives of ORG , the ORG , made enquiries with the second and third applicants about the affairs of ORG soon after their appointment . According to the applicants , they co - operated fully with these enquiries . However , ORG asserted in the press that the money belonging to PERSON had been improperly transferred to LOC and named the applicants in this connection . Subsequent press reporting on the subject had a damaging effect on the applicants ' business , as well as their professional and personal reputations . The first applicant ceased to trade by DATE as a result of persistent adverse publicity .", "On DATE the ORG petitioned ORG of GPE ( \u201c the NORP High Court \u201d ) for an ex parte order against inter alia ORG and the first applicant on the basis that the sum of GBP CARDINAL belonging to BCI investors had been misappropriated . ORG was joined as a party for the purpose of obtaining documents and no substantive relief was sought against it .", "On DATE the ORG made an interim order restraining ORG from removing any of its assets from outside its jurisdiction or otherwise disposing of its assets . The Order applied to the second and third applicants since they were deemed to be agents of ORG on account of the fact that they were joint authorised security signatories on ORG 's bank accounts in LOC . The court also ordered that the first applicant 's solicitors permit the Receivers or their representatives to enter their offices and to search for and remove any documents relating to ORG . Under the terms of the Order the Receivers were authorised to use any such documents for the purposes of their intended action against , inter alia , ORG and the first applicant , and for investigating , tracing or making proprietary claims in other jurisdictions .", "By summons issued on DATE , the ORG commenced an action ( CH ORG ) against ORG , the first applicant and its solicitors and CARDINAL banks . The only claim against ORG was for discovery of documents .", "On DATE the ORG granted the Receiver 's ex parte request for an interim order against a certain C. who had been closely connected with the running of PERSON . It was alleged by the Receivers that C. owned and controlled ORG and must have appreciated that the funds which he received either directly or through ORG were the proceeds of the misapplication of ORG 's investors ' funds . The ORG further alleged that a sum of money belonging to BCI investors had been transferred on DATE from the first applicant 's account to ORG account on the instructions of the second and third applicants .", "Also on DATE a copy of ORG Order of DATE was served on the first applicant 's solicitors . Pursuant to the terms of the LAW the first applicant 's solicitors delivered up documents relating to ORG and the applicants . The applicants maintain that they did not receive copies of any documents either seized or handed over voluntarily until DATE , and that the final copies were not returned until DATE .", "On DATE the ORG made an Order in favour of the Receivers and on an ex parte application by them . The LAW empowered the Receivers to provide ORG with documents obtained from the first applicant 's solicitors . On DATE the court amended its Order of DATE so as to stipulate that any information disclosed under that Order be only used against the first applicant or its solicitors with the leave of the court . According to the applicants the terms of the amended Order indicated that CARDINAL of the purposes for which the Receivers obtained the Order of DATE was to obtain documents for use against the first applicant .", "On DATE the ORG made CARDINAL Orders on the application of the Receivers . Both Orders permitted the Receivers to disclose the documents which they had obtained from the first applicant 's solicitors to ORG officials , provided the latter gave an undertaking as to the purposes for which the documents would be used . The Orders were later replaced by a new Order dated DATE which committed a ORG official to undertake that any information lawfully disclosed by the ORG would not be used in any proceedings against , inter alia , the first applicant without the leave of the court , and that no such information would be communicated to any other ORG official unless the latter gave a similar written undertaking .", "On DATE the first applicant and its solicitors applied for an Order striking out action ORG for want of prosecution . On DATE the ORG , with the consent of the parties , ordered that the proceedings be stayed , subject to respect by the Receivers of the above - mentioned undertaking .", "Between DATE neither the Receivers nor the ORG took any further steps in action ORG or in other proceedings against the applicants .", "On DATE the ORG issued a summons against the first applicant in the Manx High Court in which they claimed damages for breach of constructive trust on the part of the first applicant in relation to the sum of GBP CARDINAL which it had received and transferred on the instructions of the second and third applicants to the account of ORG on CARDINAL DATE . This action was listed as Action CLA CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "On DATE the Receivers commenced another action ( Action CLA CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in the Manx High Court against the first applicant in which they claimed damages for breach of constructive trust in relation to the sum of GBP CARDINAL received by ORG on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the ORG granted the Receiver 's ex parte application to join the second and third applicants to the proceedings against the first applicant .", "Summonses were eventually served without prior notice on the first and second applicants on DATE , DATE after the impugned transactions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL half years after the Receivers first commenced proceedings against the first applicant . The Receivers were granted leave to serve a summons on the third applicant out of the jurisdiction of ORG since the third applicant , on account of the adverse publicity to which he had been subjected as a result of the ORG ' investigation , had taken up residence in GPE . The summons was served on the third applicant in DATE .", "On DATE the ORG served a consolidated statement of case following the decision of the Manx High Court to join Actions CLA CARDINAL/CARDINAL and ORG . The consolidated statement of case contained allegations dating back to events which had occurred in DATE .", "On DATE the first and second applicants applied for the consolidated action to be struck out on grounds of abuse of process and want of prosecution . They also requested that the Order of CARDINAL DATE adding the second and third applicants to the action be set aside since the DATE limitation period contained in section DATE ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE had expired .", "On DATE the ORG heard argument on the applicants ' striking out application . On CARDINAL DATE His Honour PERSON ruled that the application was refused . Nevertheless , the judge stated that he was sympathetic to the plight of the applicants given that the subject matter of the DATE proceedings could well have been initiated against them in DATE . However , he expressed the view that :", "\u201c ... the plain fact is that the DATE proceedings have never been adjudicated upon and the DATE proceedings specify , for the first time , the substantive claims against [ the applicants ] . This court therefore , in its discretion , is not prepared to strike out the DATE proceedings . ... \u201d .", "In the judge 's opinion the period of inaction by the ORG , DATE and DATE , amounted to a period of inordinate and inexcusable delay . However , with reference to the rules of court , the judge concluded that he had no option but to hold that a plaintiff was permitted to wait for DATE after commencing an action before serving a summons or even informing the latter that the summons had been issued . Furthermore , he observed that it was likely that there had been a breach of undertakings as to the use to be made of the documents obtained from the first applicant 's solicitors , since they may well have been used to prepare the consolidated statement of claim . However , the judge did not regard the breaches in a serious light .", "On DATE the ORG heard CARDINAL applications arising out of the fact that the ORG had incorrectly described themselves as ORG in the summonses initiating Actions CLA CARDINAL/CARDINAL and ORG , since ORG had never in fact been placed in receivership . Although resisted by the applicants , His Honour PERSON granted the Receivers leave on DATE to amend the consolidated statement of claim in order to correct the errors in the summonses .", "On DATE His Honour PERSON dismissed the applicants ' application to set aside the Order of DATE , on the grounds that section ORG ) of LAW DATE did not apply to the claims against the second and third applicants .", "On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG against the judge 's ruling on the striking - out application and , on DATE , against the rulings handed down on CARDINAL and DATE .", "Over DATE , DATE and DATE , ORG heard argument on the merits of the applicants ' appeals including a new contention that the consolidated action could not be maintained unless the ORG , the principal beneficiary of the action , was a party to it .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' appeals . It found that His Honour PERSON had jurisdiction to rectify the error in the description of the FAC in the initial summonses and that he had properly exercised his discretion to correct a bona fide misdescription of which the applicants were well aware and which had caused them no prejudice . On the limitation point , ORG reviewed the relevant domestic and ORG authorities , as well as legal literature in this area , including that on constructive trusts and fraud on pre - existing trusts , and concluded that the action against the second and third applicants was not statute - barred as alleged .", "As to the applicants ' argument that the delay in bringing the proceedings justified dismissal of the action for want of prosecution , ORG noted that the applicants conceded that the only period of delay to be considered was that DATE and DATE , that this delay related only to the first applicant and that the second and third applicants did not contend that there was any inordinate or inexcusable delay in serving summonses on them . ORG stated :", "\u201c It seems to us plain that [ the first applicant ] was not served with all convenient speed . Such summonses should have been served promptly and manifestly they were not . We think it beyond any doubt that the delay relied on by the [ applicants ] was both inordinate and inexcusable . PERSON found that the ' the period of inaction by the [ Receivers ] DATE and DATE amounted to a period of inordinate and inexcusable delay ' . We agree with him save only that ( a ) in respect of the second summons against the [ first applicant ] the period could only begin on DATE when it was issued and ( b ) in respect of both summonses the period of such delay should be reduced to reflect a relatively short time during which the summonses could have been served with all convenient speed . \u201d", "ORG next considered whether in the case of the first applicant such delay could prejudice its right to a fair hearing . ORG took note of the applicants ' submissions that the recollection of the second and third applicants as to the events in DATE would be impaired with the result that the value of their oral testimony at the hearing would be diminished . In addition , the person responsible for the affairs of ORG and who was at the centre of CARDINAL of the impugned transactions had died in DATE . In consequence a vital witness had been lost through the delay . ORG rejected these submissions . It considered inter alia that on the facts of the case the issues would largely turn on documentary evidence and that recollections as to whether the transactions , which were substantial , were regarded as proper were most unlikely to be diminished . Accordingly , ORG , agreeing with the conclusion of His Honour PERSON on this issue , was satisfied that a fair hearing was possible .", "ORG also rejected the applicants ' argument that the DATE action should be struck out on the ground that it could have been brought within the DATE action . In ORG view the High Court judge was correct to rule that , with respect to the first applicant , the DATE action only related to the production of documents and that the second and third applicants were never parties to that action .", "ORG further ruled that the delay , even if inexcusable , could not be considered an abuse of process . In addition , the court found that while there had been a breach of the undertakings entered into by the Receivers in that the documents obtained from the first applicant had been used to formulate the statement of case in the proceedings , the breach was not of a serious nature and that no significant prejudice would be caused to the applicants since they would in any event be obliged to disclose all their documents on discovery . Finally , ORG rejected the applicants ' submission that the ORG was the assignee of the litigation and , given their absence from the proceedings , the action was improperly constituted . In the court 's opinion , and with reference to the LAW made by ORG , the ORG had properly brought the proceedings in a representative capacity on behalf of all investors , not just those who had assigned their rights to the ORG , and the ORG operated with the authority to compromise the action , again on behalf of all investors .", "On DATE ORG , without giving reasons , refused the applicants ' application for leave to appeal .", "The second and third applicants renewed their application for leave to appeal to ORG on the strength of an ORG judgment delivered on DATE wherein it was stated that ORG appeared to have misunderstood one of the decided cases on which it relied in interpreting the limitation point under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE .", "On DATE ORG , without giving reasons , refused the second and third applicants ' renewed application ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
