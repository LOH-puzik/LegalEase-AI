THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are , save for certain relatives of PERSON who are NORP citizens , NORP nationals and represented by PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE . They are relatives of persons who were killed , or victims themselves of injuries caused , by bomb explosions in GPE and GPE . The names and details of the applicants are contained in the case - file .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , CARDINAL car bombs exploded without warning in GPE , killing CARDINAL people and injuring over CARDINAL . At TIME , CARDINAL car bombs exploded within TIME of each other at CARDINAL locations in GPE , namely FAC , FAC and FAC . The fourth car bomb exploded TIME in GPE .", "The NORP authorities conducted extensive investigations . It was discovered that the cars used for the bombing were stolen in GPE DATE . ORG ( ORG ) conducted an investigation into the theft of the cars and related offences which did not produce any result . No murder inquiry was begun in GPE . Authorities on both sides of the border held suspicions that the events were carried out by loyalist paramilitaries .", "In DATE , ORG broadcast a documentary \u201c Hidden Hand \u2013 the Forgotten Masssacre \" which raised concerns as to whether elements of the GPE security forces were involved in the bombings . It alleged that the bombers included not CARDINAL suspects ( members of the ORG including PERSON and PERSON ) but named in addition CARDINAL planners , PERSON , PERSON and a loyalist killer known as the PERSON , not named for legal reasons , all of whom were former or serving members of the ORG . It was suggested that despite much early information in the investigation , the trail ran cold at ORG headquarters in GPE . Enquiries into suspects had to be made through the ORG who did not report back . There was no evidence that the ORG had ever bothered to question or arrest the suspects . The programme included interviews inter alia with PERSON , an army officer who had in DATE been working undercover for ORG and MICARDINAL , PERSON , a senior army information officer in DATE and various explosives experts and suggested that the organising of the GPE bombings had been beyond the limited loyalist expertise at the time and that they must have had assistance . It was further suggested that military intelligence had infiltrated the loyalist structures , that certain loyalists were working closely with intelligence in operations including acts of cross - border terrorism and that some of the explosive used in the GPE bombings had been provided from security force sources", "Following the programme , relatives of the victims obtained from the NORP Minister of ORG a commitment that the PERSON investigation into the bombings would be reviewed and any new evidence referred to in the documentary would be examined . In the PERSON investigation which followed , police obtained the co - operation of the ORG and attended interviews of suspects in GPE , including PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . Interviews were also conducted with PERSON and PERSON but they declined to make a statement and did not offer any evidence to support the allegations made during the programme .", "On DATE , ORG issued a press release setting out conclusions reached in the review . It cast doubt on the credibility of the documentary .", "In DATE , the relatives obtained the services of a solicitor and counsel , who reviewed the material and advised that there was insufficient evidence of any allegation of ORG wrongdoing to be advanced in respect of the bombings themselves . They advised that further evidence would have to be obtained and that such evidence could only be obtained by some form of public inquiry . They also advised that there was sufficient basis to lodge a complaint with ORG that the ORG had failed to conduct a murder inquiry into matters connected with the bombings in GPE and GPE . An application , no . CARDINAL , PERSON the GPE brought by CARDINAL of the relatives of the victims was rejected by ORG on DATE for failure to comply with DATE time - limit ( that is , the complaint had not been introduced within DATE of the programme which had made the applicant aware of the alleged failure of the GPE authorities to co - operate with the NORP authorities\u2019 inquiry ) .", "On DATE , ORG appointed a ORG whose terms of reference included considerations of the needs and concerns of victims of major outrages including those of the GPE and GPE bombings . In DATE , ORG recommended a private judicial inquiry .", "In DATE , allegations by PERSON , a former ORG who had served DATE in prison for the murder of PERSON , were made public . He named persons allegedly involved in bombings and shootings , including the GPE and GPE bombings and suggested that collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and certain elements in the security forces was taking place in DATE . NORP police officers interviewed him in DATE and he made a statement .", "In DATE , ORG agreed to establish a non - statutory ORG . Mr Justice PERSON was eventually appointed to head the inquiry and issue a report to the Government , after which a committee of ORG would decide whether any further steps should be taken . The inquiry was informal , did not sit in public and had no legal powers .", "In DATE , the inquiry report ( \" ORG \" ) was made public . The inquiry had heard evidence , inter alia , from PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and NORP police officers involved in the investigations . PERSON named PERSON as the main organiser of the bombings and had claimed that explosives for all CARDINAL bombs had been supplied by a named ORG officer . ORG had also named PERSON , a ORG officer , as assembling the GPE bombs . He did not claim that ORG or intelligence contacts assisted PERSON and PERSON in planning the bombings . Written evidence before the inquiry included materials from the ORG who had carried out a number of interviews at the request of the NORP police , including PERSON , a constable in ORG who owned the farm allegedly central to the activities of the group named by PERSON , ORG and the ORG officer named by ORG as supplying explosives . They had all rejected the allegations .", "In his statement to ORG of ORG , Mr Justice PERSON stated that the inquiry was satisfied that it had received all relevant documentation from sources within the ORG . As regarded elsewhere , he noted that from the early stages the inquiry had received assurances of co - operation from ORG and ORG ( GPE ) . From its dealings with the ORG / ORG , the ORG had received a considerable amount of information , including records of the questioning in DATE of ORG officers suspected of participating in attacks on NORP civilians as well as ballistics evidence . There had been considerable delay in obtaining information from the Secretary of ORG for GPE . The inquiry was told that this was because there were CARDINAL files of possible relevance in ORG alone , while files in ORG could be counted in the CARDINAL . The teams examining these files were stated to have finished at DATE . On DATE , a CARDINAL page letter was sent by the Secretary of ORG containing the promised information . An appendix of CARDINAL pages gave details of the structure and control of intelligence gathering at the relevant time . No copies of original documents had been provided . Further requests for specific information did produce some additional information in a similar form .", "\" Correspondence with ORG undoubtedly produced some useful information ; but its value was reduced by reluctance to make original documents available and the refusal to make other information available on security grounds . While the Inquiry fully understands the position taken by ORG on these matters , it must be said that the scope of this report is limited as a result . \"", "The inquiry summarised its conclusions as follows :", "\" The facts , circumstances , causes and perpetrators of the bombs :", "The GPE and GPE bombings were carried out by CARDINAL groups of loyalist paramilitaries , CARDINAL based in GPE and the other in the area around GPE / GPE . Most , though not all of those involved were members of the ORG ( ORG ) . It is likely that the bombings were conceived and planned in GPE , with the ORG element providing operational assistance .", "The bombings were primarily a reaction to LAW in particular to the prospect of a greater role for ORG in the administration of GPE \u2013 though there were other specific events in DATE and DATE which might have influenced the attacks .", "The loyalist groups who carried out the bombings in GPE were capable of doing so without help from any section of the security forces in GPE , though this does not rule out the involvement of individual ORG , GPE or NORP army members . The GPE bombing in particular bears all the hallmarks of a standard loyalist operation and required no assistance .", "It is likely that PERSON at GPE played a significant part in the preparation for the attacks . It is also likely that members of the FAC and ORG either participated in , or were aware of those preparations .", "The nature , extent and adequacy of the PERSON investigation , including the co - operation with and from the relevant authorities in GPE and the handling of evidence , including the scientific analyses of forensic evidence :", "The PERSON investigation failed to make full use of the information which it obtained . Certain lines of inquiry that could have been pursued in this jurisdiction were not pursued . There were other matters , including the questioning of suspects , in which the assistance of the ORG should have been requested , but was not .", "The ORG was not equipped to conduct an adequate forensic analysis of the explosions . This was because the importance of the preservation , prompt collection and analysis was not appreciated . The effect of this was that potentially vital clues were lost .", "Although the investigation teams had in their opinion no evidence upon which to found a prosecution , there is no evidence that they sought the advice of the Attorney General , in whose name criminal prosecutions were at that time still being brought . Had the Attorney General reviewed the file , it is likely that advice would have been given as to what further direction the investigation might take .", "The reasons why no prosecution took place , including whether and if so , by whom and to what extent the investigations were impeded :", "A number of those suspected for the bombings were reliably said to have had relationships with ORG and/or ORG Special Branch officers . It is reasonable to assume that exchanges of information took place . It is therefore possible that the assistance provided to the PERSON investigation team by the security forces in GPE was affected by a reluctance to compromise those relationships , in the interests of securing further information in the future . But any such conclusion would require very cogent evidence . No such evidence is in the possession of the Inquiry . There remains a deep suspicion that the investigation into the bombings was hampered by such factors , but it can not be put further than that .", "There is evidence which shows that the informal exchange of information between the PERSON on the border and their ORG counterparts was extensive . There is some evidence to suggest that some PERSON officers , unwittingly or otherwise , may have been giving information to the members of ORG . The ORG has found no evidence to support the proposition that such exchanges in some way facilitated the passage of the GPE and GPE bombers across the border . Similarly , no basis has been found for concluding that the PERSON investigation was in any way inhibited because of a fear of exposing such links .", "The Inquiry has examined allegations that the PERSON investigation was wound down as a result of political interference . No evidence was found to support that proposition . However , it can be said that the Government of DATE showed little interest in the bombings . When information was given to them suggesting that the NORP authorities had intelligence naming the bombers , this was not followed up . Any follow - up was limited to complaints by the Minister for ORG that those involved had been released from internment .", "The issues raised by the \u2018 Hidden Hand\u2019 TV . documentary broadcast in DATE :", "There is no evidence that any branch of the security forces knew in advance that the bombings were about to take place . This has been reiterated by the current Secretary of ORG for GPE and is accepted by the Inquiry . If they did know , it is unlikely that there would be any official records . Such knowledge would not have been written down ; or if it was , would not have been in any files made available to the Secretary of ORG . There is evidence that the Secretary of ORG of the day was not fully informed on matters of which he should have been made aware . On that basis , it is equally probable that similarly sensitive information might be withheld from the present holder of that office .", "The Inquiry believes that within a short time of the bombings taking place , the security forces in GPE had good intelligence to suggest who was responsible . An example of this could be the unknown intelligence that led ORG sources to tell their ORG counterparts that CARDINAL of the bombers had been arrested on CARDINAL May and detained . Unfortunately , the Inquiry has been unable to discover the nature of this and other intelligence available to the security forces in GPE at that time .", "As is made clear in the ORG , there are grounds for suspecting that the bombers may have had assistance from members of the security forces . The involvement of individual members in such an activity does not of itself mean the bombings were either officially or unofficially state - sanctioned . If CARDINAL accepts that some people were involved , they may well have been acting on their own initiative . Ultimately , a finding that there was collusion between the perpetrators and the authorities in GPE is a matter of inference . On some occasions an inference is irresistible or can be drawn as a matter of probability . Here , it is the view of the Inquiry that this inference is not sufficiently strong . It does not follow even as a matter of probability . Unless further information comes to hand , such involvement must remain a suspicion . It is not proven . \"", "In DATE , hearings on the report took place before ORG of ORG on ORG , ORG Women \u2019s Rights . ORG issued its final report on DATE , making a number of recommendations , inter alia , that ORG be set up in respect of identified concerns about the PERSON investigation ( the reason it was wound down in DATE and did not pursue certain leads ) and missing documentation from police , intelligence and ORG files . As regarded external issues of collusion , the ORG noted that PERSON Justice PERSON had requested assistance from the GPE and GPE authorities and that he was furnished with a CARDINAL page summary of any relevant information on the GPE and GPE bombings which had resulted from a trawl of their files . ORG had invited former and current ministers and officers from GPE and GPE to make oral or written submissions to elaborate on this document and any other relevant matters but these invitations were declined . It stated :", "\" ORG wishes to express its grave disappointment at the response received to these invitations . An examination of GPE and GPE records from the time in question would be necessary for any examination of this area . However , neither the ORG nor Mr Justice PERSON were afforded the co - operation which the gravity of the atrocity required . \u201d", "It took the view that the information received by it had reinforced suspicion of collusion between security forces and loyalist groups in GPE and that further extensive investigation was required . It noted the self - evident problems that arose since potentially relevant information and witnesses were outside the jurisdiction and access to these sources in GPE and GPE were vital . It concluded that a Public Tribunal of Inquiry in GPE or GPE was required , presided over by a judge of international standing and with powers to summon witnesses and compel disclosure of documents , and that in the event of a lack of co - operation from GPE in that respect ORG should consider instituting proceedings before the ORG in GPE .", "Meanwhile , the lawyers acting for the relatives in \" Justice for the Forgotten \" discovered that the inquests into the death of those who had died in the bombings in DATE had been adjourned . In DATE the GPE agreed that the inquests should proceed once the inquiry report had issued . The inquests took place in DATE and issued findings of unlawful killing ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
