In order to avoid such a risk in given cases , certain GPE have chosen the route of seeking assurances from the country of destination that the person concerned will not be ill - treated . This practice is far from new , but has come under the spotlight in DATE as GPE have increasingly sought to remove from their territory persons deemed to endanger national security . Fears are growing that the use of diplomatic assurances is in fact circumventing the prohibition of torture and ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . The seeking of diplomatic assurances from countries with a poor overall record in relation to torture and ill - treatment is giving rise to particular concern . It does not necessarily follow from such a record that someone whose deportation is envisaged personally runs a real risk of being ill - treated in the country concerned ; the specific circumstances of each case have to be taken into account when making that assessment . However , if in fact there would appear to be a risk of ill - treatment , can diplomatic assurances received from the authorities of a country where torture and illtreatment is widely practised ever offer sufficient protection against that risk ? It has been advanced with some cogency that even assuming those authorities do exercise effective control over the agencies that might take the person concerned into their custody ( which may not always be the case ) , there can be no guarantee that assurances given will be respected in practice . If these countries fail to respect their obligations under international human rights treaties ratified by them , so the argument runs , why should CARDINAL be confident that they will respect assurances given on a bilateral basis in a particular case ?", "CARDINAL . NORP In response , it has been argued that mechanisms can be devised for the postreturn monitoring of the treatment of a person deported , in the event of his / her being detained . While the ORG retains an open mind on this subject , it has yet to see convincing proposals for an effective and workable mechanism . To have any chance of being effective , such a mechanism would certainly need to incorporate some key guarantees , including the right of independent and suitably qualified persons to visit the individual concerned at any time , without prior notice , and to interview him / her in private in a place of their choosing . The mechanism would also have to offer means of ensuring that immediate remedial action is taken , in the event of it coming to light that assurances given were not being respected . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It is the view of the Special Rapporteur that diplomatic assurances are unreliable and ineffective in the protection against torture and ill - treatment : such assurances are sought usually from GPE where the practice of torture is systematic ; post - return monitoring mechanisms have proven to be no guarantee against torture ; diplomatic assurances are not legally binding , therefore they carry no legal effect and no accountability if breached ; and the person whom the assurances aim to protect has no recourse if the assurances are violated . The Special Rapporteur is therefore of the opinion that GPE can not resort to diplomatic assurances as a safeguard against torture and ill - treatment where there are substantial grounds for believing that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture or illtreatment upon return .", "CARDINAL .

Against such significant , serious and credible evidence of systematic torture by law enforcement officials in GPE , I continue to find myself appealing to ORG to refrain from transferring persons to GPE . The prohibition of torture is absolute , and GPE risk violating this prohibition DATE their obligations under international law \u2013 by transferring persons to countries where they may be at risk of torture .

In general , assessing the suitability of diplomatic assurances is relatively straightforward where they are intended to ensure that the individual concerned will not be subjected to capital punishment or certain violations of fair trial rights as a consequence of extradition . In such cases , the wanted person is transferred to a formal process , and the requesting ORG \u2019s compliance with the assurances can be monitored . While there is no effective remedy for the requested ORG or the surrendered person if the assurances are not observed , non - compliance can be readily identified and would need to be taken into account when evaluating the reliability of such assurances in any future cases .", "CARDINAL . The situation is different where the individual concerned risks being subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment in the receiving ORG upon removal . It has been noted that \u2018 unlike assurances on the use of the death penalty or trial by a military court , which are readily verifiable , assurances against torture and other abuse require constant vigilance by competent and independent ORG . ORG addressed the issue in its decision in PERSON GPE ( Minister of ORG ) , contrasting assurances in cases of a risk of torture with those given where the person extradited may face the death penalty , and signalling", "\u2018 ... the difficulty in relying too heavily on assurances by a state that it will refrain from torture in the future when it has engaged in illegal torture or allowed others to do so on its territory in the past . This difficulty becomes acute in cases where torture is inflicted not only with the collusion but through the impotence of the state in controlling the behaviour of its officials .
