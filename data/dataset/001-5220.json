The third applicant is a NORP citizen born in DATE and lives at the same address as the first and second applicant . The first applicant was the stepfather of PERSON , the second applicant was her mother and the third applicant her daughter .", "The applicants are represented before the ORG by Cairns Brown , solicitors practising in GPE , GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "PERSON was born on DATE . She died , aged DATE , on DATE from asphyxia caused by self - suspension whilst on remand at FAC PERSON ( \u201c FAC \u201d ) awaiting sentence for an offence of theft .", "PERSON was a heroin addict by the time she gave birth to her daughter , the third applicant , on DATE . As she was unable to care for the child , the third applicant lived with her grandparents . Until DATE , she lived with the first and second applicant , after which she moved out to live with friends . She was given the tenancy of a local authority house next door to the first and second applicants . She kept in close touch with them and the third applicant .", "PERSON had a number of convictions for shoplifting and breach of the peace , and had passed several spells in drug rehabilitation clinics . She had been held on remand in GPE on CARDINAL occasions prior to her final remand on DATE to CARDINAL DATE , DATE to DATE , and DATE to DATE . In DATE , the deceased went to a drug rehabilitation centre but she left after DATE before completing the programme . In DATE , she was readmitted to the centre and stayed until DATE when she again left early .", "On DATE , PERSON was arrested on charges of theft and vandalism . On appearance at GPE ORG on DATE , she pleaded guilty and was remanded in custody for ORG . She was due back in court on DATE for sentencing . She was remanded in GPE in the block used for remand prisoners .", "On arrival in GPE , PERSON was seen by a nurse . She was seen by a doctor on DATE after admission and assessed again . According to ORG , each prisoner on admission is assessed as to the likelihood of being suicidal . PERSON claimed , as on previous admissions , that she had taken heroin and was vulnerable to withdrawal symptoms . She was prescribed the relevant medicine . She was not found to present any risks of suicide .", "On DATE , PERSON was woken up in the normal way by a prison officer at TIME She was allowed out of her cell for breakfast and to go to the toilet and wash . Afterwards , she was asked to clean a corridor . The prison officer asked her to do it again properly . She complied . She was then locked in her cell again . The mail for the unit was distributed . There was none for PERSON . She did not go that morning to the medical officer to receive her medication , diazepam , a drug substitute .", "From TIME , prisoners who wished were taken under supervision to the canteen to make purchases . PERSON had no money and remained in her cell as was the routine . Generally , when prisoners were brought back from the canteen , they were placed under supervision in the sitting room where they were joined by prisoners brought from their cells for the period immediately preceding lunch .", "At TIME the deceased started kicking her cell door . Prison Officer PERSON asked what was wrong and she said she wanted to know why she could not get out of her cell . Prison Officer PERSON explained she would get out when there was enough staff back from canteen escort duty . As he walked away , she kicked the door a couple of times . He returned and told her she would be kept in the cell for a bit longer for kicking the door again . PERSON replied , \u201c That \u2019s fine \u201d .", "At TIME Prison Officer PERSON met the Residential Officer for PERSON unit and told him about her behaviour . He was concerned as this was not like her usual behaviour but did not consider it a serious situation . He did not think that it amounted to a disciplinary offence and did not tell her that she was being punished . The Residential Officer went up to PERSON cell and found her lying on her bunk . He told her that she would remain in her cell until she calmed down , probably until the TIME meal was ready . He told her that she would not be put on report . PERSON shrugged her shoulders , seemed angry and tense but did not say anything in reply . ORG returned to his office and was then called to another unit soon after TIME . He did not mention PERSON to his supervisor or anyone else . He overlooked her .", "Later , after TIME , Prison Officer PERSON was serving dinners to the inmates and noticed towards the end of lunch that he had not seen PERSON come for lunch . He went to her cell at TIME , unlocked the door and found her hanging from the window . The subsequent attempts at resuscitation failed and PERSON was declared dead at TIME", "PERSON had not previously been involved in disciplinary incidents in the prison .", "In a period of DATE , there had been CARDINAL suicides in GPE and therefore , in DATE , the Procurator Fiscal set up a ORG which was delayed due to a further suicide at the prison . The inquiry lasted DATE and the determination by the Sheriff was dated DATE .", "The ORG found the cause of death of PERSON to be asphyxia due to hanging , and the verdict was suicide . The Sheriff did not make any determination about the reasonable precautions whereby her death might have been avoided , nor about any defects in the prison system which contributed to her death . The Sheriff did however make various general determinations in respect of the systems in place at the prison , including proposals for improving procedures to prevent suicide which were relevant to the other cases under consideration .", "In his determination the ORG stated :", "\u201c The weight of the evidence was clearly that < PERSON > was forward looking , expressed a desire to obtain a house for herself and her child and gave no indication that she had any desire or impulse to kill herself . ...", "... It was ... accepted by < counsel for the applicants > that certainly up until DATE of her life < PERSON > did not present as a likely person to commit suicide ...", "Looking at the evidence as to what < the deceased > did it is clear that it did not amount to a breach of discipline meriting a report to the Governor . If that is correct then < counsel for the applicants > would argue that the Officers were at fault in keeping < the deceased > in her cell at a time when other prisoners were in free association . The CARDINAL officers did not consider they were operating in terms of the Rules ... .What they did say they were doing was giving her a \u201c cooling - off period \u201d . ...", "It was a practice whereby somebody who created a scene or a fuss which of itself did not merit a Governor \u2019s report was left in her cell or put in her cell for a short period to calm down . It was not part of any official code of practice ... It was known to the Governor and Assistant Governor . They accepted it as a necessary part of the discretion in each Officer in carrying out his or her duties of control .", "On CARDINAL view < the deceased > was not locked up for operational reasons , for example in the course of a security alert . On the other hand if cooling - off was used as a tool by Officers to quell situations and calm people down then in my view it was a valid exercise of the Governor \u2019s powers exercised through ORG . The evidence from the Officers was not clear . They changed from a cooling - off period through an alternative to a ORG to a punishment . I fully accept that Officers might in the course of their duties have to put prisoners in cells for disciplinary reasons to keep order and so on . It may be a fine distinction but it is one which in my view has to be made . I am of the view that Prison Officers do not have the power to mete out punishment . They do not in my mind have the right to impose periods behind doors as a punishment for some minor infraction of the Rules . It is CARDINAL thing to say to a prisoner : \u201c Now I \u2019m going to keep you in your cell for a bit to let you calm down . \u201d It is quite another matter to say : \u201c Because you are creating a fuss ... I will punish you by keeping you in your cell for TIME . \u201d It seems to me that FAC does not have the power to behave as in the second example . ...", "... Some time was spent on considering the consequences of < the deceased > missing her medication in the morning . The weight of the evidence was that it would have made little or no difference to her physical condition or her state of mind . ...", "I can not set out any reasonable precautions which might have prevented the death of < the deceased > ... I can not set out any defects in the system which contributed to her death . I do not know why < the deceased > killed herself . ...", "I make a composite determination in terms of LAW ( CARDINAL)(e ) of ORG as follows : - ...", "CARDINAL . In relation to < PERSON > , < the Residential Officer > had no power to inflict punishment upon her ; therefore insofar as he imposed a further period behind the door as a punishment he was acting incorrectly . \u201d", "On DATE , the applicants commenced an action in ORG , claiming on behalf of the third applicant damages for loss of society of her mother and loss of support due to the negligence and breach of statutory duties by ORG employees . It is claimed , inter alia , that the officers had no right to keep PERSON locked in as a punishment and that if she had been reported to the Governor under rule CARDINAL , instead of being left in her cell until lunchtime , she would not have taken her own life .", "The applicants requested an adjournment , agreed by the court , in order to apply for legal aid . An opinion as to causation was obtained from ORG . Legal aid was refused . An application for review of that refusal was rejected .
