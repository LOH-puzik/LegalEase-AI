The pernicious effects of microwaves range from the destruction of cell membranes and cell respiration and cell - division disorders to haemolysis , leukaemia and genetic changes including the blocking of natural cycles .", "Infernal radiation", "The artificial production of microwaves is based on the principle of alternating current . Matter ( atoms , molecules , cells ) which is irradiated by this electromagnetic radiation thus undergoes , according to the radiation frequency , CARDINAL polarity reversals or oscillations per second . Not a single atom , molecule or cell of a living organism would be able to resist destructive forces of such power , even if it was only of the order of QUANTITY .", "Mind the water !", "Of all the matter and substances in nature which are polar , the hydrogen in water reacts with the greatest sensitivity . \u2026", "Mr PERCENT water , beware !", "\u2026 the biological effects of artificially created microwaves will be correlated above all with the generation of heat by friction .

It is not measurable like the thermic effect . But under the influence of these CARDINAL effects , molecules are shattered , their structure deformed and their natural functions perverted . Such effects are probably qualitative . This pernicious effect at the qualitative level and the weakening of organic systems , such as cell membranes , are used in genetic engineering to gain access to genes . In this way the genes can be artificially altered by radiation . The cells are thus broken into and the energy tension between the outside and the inside of the cell is removed . A cell weakened in this way becomes an easy prey for viruses and fungi .", "Danger ! Cell poison", "If the stress were to be maintained , inter alia by microwaves , the repair mechanism would break down and the cell , for want of energy , would be obliged to switch to anaerobic respiration . In place of HCARDINALO and COCARDINAL ( aerobic respiration ) there appears , among other things , the cell poison HCARDINALOCARDINAL and ORG as in a cancer cell . This is why leaked radiation from microwave ovens is so dangerous . Yet safety standards vary from country to country .

Among other blood factors , the erythrocytes have the property of being mobilised ( probably from the spleen ) and rapidly increasing in number in the blood under the influence of short - term stress . If the stress continues , the number falls . Anaemic tendencies thus appear .", "ORG in food transit", "In unpasteurised milk ( variant CARDINAL ) haemoglobin levels tend to fall , in vegetables cooked with microwaves ( variant CARDINAL) they drop significantly . Haemoglobin deficits are to be regarded as stress indicators . The CARDINAL foodstuffs in question cause stress in the human organism . The digestion of unpasteurised milk is radically different from that of heated milk . The transit of unpasteurised milk through the stomach , because of its coagulation and breakdown , is lengthy and is associated with some stress for the organism . This process , however , is natural , normal and not toxic .", "Aggressiveness of milk heated with microwaves", "The transit of heat - treated milk through the stomach and intestines is generally more rapid than that of unpasteurised milk . The proteins are transformed to such an extent that they coagulate into magma more quickly . But in this accelerated transit they are not fully broken down . The heated milk thus has a less stressful effect on the organism but its nutritional value is also less . Milk heated with microwaves , on the other hand , unlike conventionally heated milk , clearly creates a situation of stress which is in no way comparable to that caused by unpasteurised milk .", "Rheumatism , fever and pituitary insufficiency", "Haemoglobin concentration and corpuscular content react like haemoglobin . There is a significant drop in the levels above all in foodstuffs prepared with microwaves ( variants CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL) . These losses also indicate anaemia .

Leucocytes are particularly sensitive to external challenges . They are often a sign of pathogenic action on the organic system by poisoning and non - infectious damage to the ( cell ) tissues . The increase in leucocytes in food prepared with microwaves ( variants CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL) is greater than with the other variants . The consequences of such a challenge can easily be imagined .", "Decreasing lymphocytes", "Lymphocytes in principle react to external challenges ( poisons , for example ) in the opposite way to leucocytes . They tend to decrease . They react similarly to haemoglobin .

On the other hand , with milk ( variants CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) the cholesterol level tends to remain unchanged , and in the case of unpasteurised milk ( variant CARDINAL ) it even drops significantly . This most interesting finding bears out the most recent scientific knowledge , according to which cholesterol , in a situation of acute challenge , can also increase rapidly owing not so much to the cholesterol content of food as to an external challenge .", "Cholesterol out of nothing", "Such challenges , as the present research shows , are also possible through foodstuffs which contain practically no cholesterol . Artificial radiation and poisons ( antigens ) have a cholesterol - forming effect . In an electromagnetic field , cholesterol undergoes changes in its crystal structure and is eliminated from the blood in the form of a deposit . In cancer patients the blood cholesterol level is always very high . This is why a raised blood cholesterol level may be regarded as an obvious sign of a precancerous condition or a developing cancerous condition .", "Loss of iron", "Iron levels tend to increase in vegetables prepared with microwaves ( variants CARDINAL and CARDINAL) , contrary to all the other variants . PERSON might be thought to be the cause of this phenomenon , being itself a consequence of damage to the membranes of blood cells . Research undertaken up to now does not enable any significant conclusions to be drawn .", "Established pathogenic disorders", "In sum , the results obtained from analysing the blood count of the volunteers fed on food prepared with microwaves to the exclusion of the other variants show changes which bear witness to pathogenic disorders .

In an order of DATE the President of ORG dismissed the application . Firstly , he expressed doubts as to the applicability of the ORG , noting , in particular , the following :", "\u201c \u2026 [ the ORG as amended is ] not \u2026 applicable to all forms of unfair behaviour regardless of the sphere in which it occurs . Its purpose is in fact only to ensure fair , undistorted competition ( section CARDINAL ORG ) and it applies only in the context , admittedly understood in a broad sense , of economic competition . The LAW can not , on the other hand , govern fields unconnected with that , such as political , sporting or scientific competition \u2026 or the expression of philosophical , moral or religious convictions . In that sense , the issue [ of the existence ] of detriment to a competitive relationship may remain relevant \u2026", "In the instant case it may be doubted whether such a relationship has really been damaged or threatened by the defendant \u2019s campaign against microwave ovens as that campaign is not in any way directed at any particular manufacturer or distributor of such appliances . \u2026 The situation is in this respect very different from the CARDINAL ruled on in the judgment published in RO CARDINAL IV CARDINAL , in which a journalist had given erroneous information about the merits of CARDINAL rival brands of sewing machine . \u2026 \u201d", "Secondly , he held that , \u201c supposing the ORG to be applicable \u201d , LAW CARDINAL of LAW did not allow the relevant interim orders to be made . In this connection , he noted the following reason in particular :", "\u201c ...", "... the imminent infringement of which the [ ORG ] complains is not , prima facie , apt to cause it any damage affecting it personally . On the other hand , some of its members may suffer damage in the form of loss of turnover . ... there is nothing to show that such damage might be very substantial , and it can not be presumed that it will be .", "Indeed , no information has been provided on the turnover in respect of microwave ovens achieved by the members of the association , the relation which that turnover bears to the turnover in respect of other appliances , whether there has been any reduction in the sale of microwave ovens since the articles appeared in issue no . CARDINAL of the ORG PERSON or any reconversion to purchases of traditional cookers . Prima facie , it seems doubtful that the defendant \u2019s campaign has entailed any largescale disaffection of the general public . Admittedly , his journal has a large circulation , but it must be read above all by people who have already made up their minds and who in all probability did not envisage buying a microwave oven . As to other members of the public , while they might have heard about PERSON statements , which have been echoed in the ordinary press , they will also have been aware of the reassuring statements published in particular by the ORG and the ORG [ ORG ] that have also been referred to in the general press . When one sees how ineffective anti - smoking campaigns are , despite being based on undisputed scientific data and being supported by the authorities , it is by no means certain that the defendant \u2019s statements , even if they were to be repeated , could substantially affect the market in microwave ovens for any length of time .", "... In the light , inter alia , of the private expert \u2019s report by Professor PERSON [ see paragraph DATE below ] , the clarification given by the WHO and the ORG and his own modest knowledge of scientific method , the President takes it as read that the research carried out by Dr PERSON is insufficient to support the categorical conclusions which the defendant thought he could draw from it . The most that can be deduced from that research is that it would be appropriate to carry out a more thorough , rigorously methodical survey on a larger number of people . It is clearly unreasonable to affirm , as was done in issue no . CARDINAL of the ORG PERSON that it has been scientifically proved that microwave ovens are harmful and that they must be immediately destroyed and their use banned . It nonetheless remains the case that some scientists still have doubts about the safety of microwave ovens . The fact that they are in a minority does not of itself enable one to exclude the possibility that they might be partly right , as this is an area in which no certainty exists . Indeed , when the ORG \u2019s report is read in full it can be seen that there remain a number of unresolved problems .", "In these circumstances , and even if it seems highly likely that PERSON statements are wholly unfounded , I can not find that it is absolutely clear that that is the case . ...", "\u2026 Lastly , the interim orders sought would appear disproportionate at all events . They would in fact lead to a kind of judicial censorship of scientific research and the conclusions that may be drawn from it , and this is scarcely compatible with the living traditions in this country , in which it is generally considered that it is for one \u2019s peers and not for the courts to assess the worth and significance of a scientist \u2019s work . \u201d", "The judge nevertheless took formal note of Mr PERSON \u2019s undertaking", "\u201c \u2026 not to use in forthcoming publications of his newspaper or in any other publications or at press conferences , public events or presentations to the media images of a skeleton or a cross or tomb in association with the presentation of a microwave oven \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

In a judgment of DATE ORG allowed the application . It gave the following reasons ( translated from NORP ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . \u2026", "The amended ORG differs from the former enactment in having substantially wider scope . Its key characteristic is its functional approach , based on guaranteeing fair , undistorted competition . That approach is apparent from the new drafting of the Act \u2019s protective aim in section CARDINAL ORG and has led to a new definition of the offence of unfair competition in the general provision of LAW . The requirement of a competitive relationship , for instance , has been removed from the LAW . Its personal scope , as apparent from section CARDINAL , does not cover only the acts of competitors , suppliers and customers ; third parties not involved in such relations may be ( independently ) liable if their conduct affects relations in the context of economic competition and if , through their statements , they adversely affect the competitive position of the person targeted ( see NORP and ORG , ORG , p. CARDINAL ) . Competition is particularly affected by consumer - protection organisations , but also , for example , by reviewers , art critics and media personalities . Also caught by the LAW are the authors of financial analyses , company reports and \u2013 what is of importance here \u2013 scientific studies , provided that the essential elements of the offence of unfair competition are present ( PERSON , SZW CARDINAL/CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . In the event of inaccurate , misleading or unnecessarily derogatory statements concerning the subject of study , these people will be guilty of unfair competition . The new wording of section CARDINAL ORG has thus put an end to the old controversy as to whether the application of the LAW requires the existence of a competitive relationship . Persons unconnected with a sector who interfere in the competition between third parties are likewise caught by LAW ( PERSON , PERSON , p. CARDINAL ; cf . FAC CARDINAL IV CARDINAL : ORG ) . In each case , however , it must be ascertained whether the behaviour of the person concerned affects the relations between competitors or between suppliers and customers . The LAW is directed at all those whose behaviour or commercial management may have an effect on economic competition . The decisive factor is whether the activity complained of has direct or indirect effects on the competitive position of the person making it or of a third party ( GPE , GPE Wettbewerb , GPE DATE , pp . CARDINAL and DATE ) . Both according to legal writers and in practice , economic relevance in the sense of a potential aptitude to affect competition is taken into account ( see PERSON , PERSON i QUANTITY UWG , SMI DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . Capability of affecting competition must be determined objectively ; it is of no importance whether given behaviour is associated with a subjective intention to affect the market ; the decisive factor is whether the action in question is objectively apt to affect competition ( PERSON , ibid . , p. CARDINAL ; cf . ORG , pp . CARDINAL et seq . : ORG ) . This was so in the instant case , as was set out above in relation to the question of the plaintiff \u2019s locus standi . Even if there is no certain proof of a connection between the drop in turnover in respect of microwave ovens and the [ defendant \u2019s ] behaviour , it is clear that the statements and publications complained of in the instant case are apt to diminish sales of microwave ovens and , consequently , to harm the businesses associated with the plaintiff . The objective aptitude to affect competition is therefore established .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ORG defines as unfair and illegal \u2018 any conduct or commercial practice ... if it is deceptive or in any other way offends the principle of good faith and if it affects relations between competitors or between suppliers and ORG . The general provision of LAW is given concrete expression by the provisions of sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL , which describe the special factual ingredients ( NORP ) of the offence . Section CARDINAL(a ) provides that a person acts unfairly if , in particular , he denigrates others or the goods , work , services , prices or business of others by making inaccurate , misleading or unnecessarily wounding statements . Unfair competition does not necessarily presuppose either bad faith or fault , but merely an objective breach of good faith ( BGE CARDINAL PERSON , CARDINAL ) . A statement is \u2018 inaccurate\u2019 if it can objectively be seen to be false ( NORP and Troller , p. CARDINAL ) . A statement is \u2018 ORG if , while not untrue , it creates a false impression through the use of devious means ; as with the risk of confusion in the context of trademark disputes , the yardstick to be used here is that of the usual vigilance and discernment of the customers targeted . A statement may be \u2018 unnecessarily wounding\u2019 in various ways . Firstly , the manner in which a statement is made may be considered improper if it goes far beyond what would appear reasonable in the light of what had caused the statement to be made . Secondly , even where an accurate factual basis exists , the value judgments expressed may be unlawful if they appear unjustified on the facts . Lastly , a statement may also be wounding if it is inaccurate or is mainly and without good cause intended to harm another . Criticism that is impermissible in form , content or aim is therefore unacceptable \u2026 It has already been held in ORG CARDINAL no . CARDINAL \u2026 that the description \u2018 dangerous\u2019 was derogatory in character . Advertising based on fear , using expressions such as \u2018 take X , otherwise it will be too late\u2019 , \u2018 do n\u2019t take any risks\u2019 , \u2018 better too early than too late\u2019 , \u2018 tooth decay is lurking\u2019 , or even simply \u2018 keep your ORG is also unacceptable \u2026", "\u2026", "\u2026 it is certain that it can not be said that it is scientifically proved that food prepared with a microwave oven constitutes a danger to health and is carcinogenic . To date , there has been no scientific evidence that such a danger exists . The defendant \u2019s assertions are not corroborated either by his own research DATE which did not meet generally accepted scientific standards DATE or by that of other , respectable scientists . The opposite would seem to be nearer the truth , as is shown by the observations of ORG and ORG . In that regard , the fact that Professor PERSON clearly dissociated himself from the conclusions drawn by the defendant from their joint research is likewise significant . The defendant \u2019s statements that food prepared in microwave ovens is a danger to health and leads to changes in the blood of those who consume it that indicate a pathological disorder and present a pattern that could be seen as the beginning of a carcinogenic process are manifestly false and untrue and consequently inaccurate within the meaning of section CARDINAL(a ) ORG . The application must therefore be allowed . The applicant remains of course free to base his propositions on new scientific findings .", "\u2026", "There would nonetheless have been a breach of the ORG even if the defendant \u2019s belief had been objectively accurate since , as has already been said , section CARDINAL(a ) ORG also prohibits misleading or unnecessarily wounding statements . Such statements were made in the present case as will be explained in greater detail under point CARDINAL below .", "CARDINAL . The ORG can not share the opinion of Professor PERSON , published in ORG DATE , p. CARDINAL and cited by the defendant , that for an unfair act to affect competition within the meaning of section CARDINAL ORG there must be a corresponding intention , that is to say a subjective wish to have an impact on competition . That view is inconsistent with the aim pursued by the ORG , which is to guarantee , in the interests of all the parties concerned , fair , undistorted competition ( see section CARDINAL ORG ) ; those concerned are thus competitors , customers and the general public ( \u2018 tripartite nature\u2019 of competition law and \u2018 equivalence\u2019 of the CARDINAL interested groups , PERSON , pp . CARDINAL and DATE ) . There is consequently nothing in the LAW to support that opinion . An amendment to the LAW would be necessary for that ( cf . PERSON , ZSR CARDINAL I , DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , with reference to ORG reply to the motion of a national councillor , PERSON , concerning a revision of the ORG , ORG of DATE ) . \u2026 The principle of good faith mentioned in the general provision of section CARDINAL ORG , which is decisive of the issue of fairness and therefore of legality , must be construed in the light of the Act \u2019s purpose and the special factual ingredients of section CARDINAL(a ) ORG . These define in greater detail the unlawful conduct , for which no fault is required , constituting the tort of \u2018 unfair competition\u2019 . No competitive relationship between the \u2018 ORG and the \u2018 victim\u2019 is required under LAW ( see above ) . All that is needed is behaviour apt to affect competition ; a very weak link with an economic activity will thus suffice ( GPE , Unlauterer Wettbewerb , p. CARDINAL ; cf . also BGE CARDINAL IV , pp . CARDINAL et seq . : ORG ) ; that is a consequence of the functional conception that governed the revision of the LAW . The new ORG was intended to enlarge the sphere of protection afforded by the LAW . Thus , in the light of the provision setting out the aim pursued by the LAW and of the general provision of the LAW , the requirement of an intention to affect competition is incompatible with the definition of the tort of unfair competition within the meaning of the general provision of section CARDINAL ORG , as it is not contained in that definition ( cf . PERSON , loc . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) . Anyone who in his media work seeks to cause a scandal or a sensation is also caught by LAW Freedom of the press does not relieve those concerned from the obligation to comply with professional ethical standards \u2013 on the contrary , it takes such an obligation for granted ( GPE , loc . cit . p. CARDINAL , cf . PERSON , loc . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) .", "Even if the ORG were to accept Nobel \u2019s opinion , it would not in the instant case be led to a different conclusion . Intention ( PERSON ) is a particular form of knowledge that one is acting wrongly ( PERSON ) . For such intention to exist , it suffices that the person concerned is aware of the possibility that the act will be carried out and that he accepts that possibility ( recklessness ; cf . Stark , PERSON , ORG , notes CARDINAL et seq . , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . As a subscriber to the ORG PERSON the defendant knew to whom he was sending the research paper for publication . He thus accepted the simplistic and exaggerated interpretation of the published article , and he also endorsed the publication in its entirety since at no stage did he dissociate himself from even part of it in writing but , while not considering it to be PERCENT accurate , nevertheless approved it with the representation of the Reaper .", "CARDINAL . Since the scope of the ORG is determined by the mere potential aptitude to affect competition , acts performed in the exercise of fundamental rights in the field of ideas are covered by it , even when they have only a remote link with economic activity ; only acts that are no more than ideas fall outside the scope of the statute , provided that they are confined to a strictly personal sphere of activity ( GPE , loc . cit . , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , PERSON , ORG , p. CARDINAL ) . In that respect , whether or not the activity concerned is remunerated is irrelevant . However , an act will not be caught by the ORG merely because it is performed outside the private sphere . It is necessary that there be a link , however weak , with an economic activity . Acts that are performed for purely disinterested ends are not covered by the ORG . Such would be the case , for example , with associations whose activity is wholly disinterested . An association will be disinterested if it pursues altruistic aims and does not deal in the ( economic ) market . If it does so deal , even without seeking to make a profit , it will lose the exemption ( GPE , loc . cit . p. CARDINAL ) .", "The freedom to carry out scientific research , which can be considered a fundamental right ( see PERSON , PERSON , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) has not been infringed in the instant case . The defendant was and remains entitled to pursue his research . The majority of legal writers consider that scientific freedom includes the freedom to carry out research , to teach and to use the result of research done by others ( see PERSON , loc . cit . ) . In that regard , it is necessary to distinguish scientific freedom from the freedom to communicate to others the knowledge gained . Like practically all fundamental rights , this freedom of expression ( as an unwritten fundamental right ) is not , however , without limits in its application . It is subject to restrictions , especially in the sphere of the mass media , by the legal order , which provides for the protection of reputation in LAW and for protection of all aspects of the personality , including economic ones , in LAW and the ORG ( see PERSON , loc . cit . , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ; ORG CARDINAL : ORG ) . Scientific freedom does not therefore justify publication \u2013 especially in non - specialist periodicals ( publication in specialist reviews would have to be considered differently ) \u2013 of provisional results of research that are misleading or devoid of sound scientific basis and do not enable conclusions to be reached with certainty . Scientific researchers must be aware of their responsibilities and give consideration to the issue of what status laymen will give to the expression of their opinion . These constraints apply to the defendant likewise . The mere fact that the application of a statute affects the exercise of a fundamental right by no means signifies that the restriction of that right is unlawful . When it enacted the ORG , the legislature knew perfectly well that there was a risk that the statute would come into conflict with the protected area of intellectual freedoms . That is why section CARDINAL ORG provides , by way of a cross - reference to LAW and CARDINAL f of LAW , that preventive measures against periodicals may be ordered only in the strictly limited circumstances set out in LAW . In the absence of more detailed provision , the assumption must be that no privilege should attach to facts such as those in the instant case . Independently of that issue , it must also be observed that , on the basis of the principle that there is no hierarchy of fundamental rights ( see ORG untereinander , thesis , GPE DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) , it is necessary to weigh against the fundamental rights relied on by the defendant the right to freedom of trade and industry .", "An essential feature is how language is used to communicate a scientific opinion when knowledge is still uncertain and , for example , is based solely on sample surveys or experiments involving small numbers of people ( CARDINAL in this instance ) who do not represent a cross - section of the population . The more clear - cut the reports of opinions , the stricter are the requirements to be made of the linguistically correct representation of the opinions concerned . It is also significant that , even after the event , the defendant did not distance himself from gross simplifications and exaggerations in the article or from the image of the Reaper with a microwave oven , which appears on every page of the research paper .", "Since the defendant has identified himself with the article in its entirety , the plaintiff \u2019s application must , in terms of competition law , be allowed . Through his assertions , which have been mentioned in detail above , and the use of the image of the Reaper , for which he is liable as he knew the style of the review and accepted and approved that exaggerated representation , the defendant has , irrespective of whether the substance was true , overstepped the acceptable limits and has thus acted \u2018 unnecessarily woundingly\u2019 within the meaning of section CARDINAL(a ) ORG . By combining a tabloid - style report with scientific comment he has also misled the intended readership . In particular , the image of the Reaper and statements such as \u2018 microwave ovens are more harmful than the GPE gas ORG , \u2018 \u2026 you are exposing yourself to a slow death \u2026 \u2019 , or \u2018 \u2026 it is certain that you will die from cancer \u2026 \u2019 \u2026 amount to unacceptable playing on the fear of death . The defendant himself had to admit that the journalist from the ORG PERSON had gone a bit too far and that his article was a little tendentious . He said that he had not liked that very much as a scientist , but the reporter had nonetheless been right . It was sometimes necessary to use a journalistic style to wake people up ...", "\u2026", "CARDINAL . Among other forms of protection , the civil law affords the possibility of applying for an injunction ( PERSON ) . The purpose of such an application is to obtain from the court an order prohibiting the defendant from interfering in the plaintiff \u2019s sphere of interest . Such an order may concern existing or continuing interference and threatened interference . The court may allow such an application irrespective of whether damage has been caused ( NORP and ORG , p. CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL ) . Applications may be lodged and injunctions issued only in respect of precisely defined acts which the defendant has committed and is likely to continue to commit or is about to commit ( BGE CARDINAL II CARDINAL ) . That is clearly true in the instant case , especially as the defendant has expressly stated that he will continue to follow that route scientifically \u2026 and has not distanced himself from the publications in issue . To the application for an injunction there may be joined an application for an order that , if he breaches the injunction , the defendant shall be punished with imprisonment under LAW or a fine ( BGE CARDINAL II CARDINAL ) . That penalty must be supplemented by the one provided for in LAW .", "\u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an application by the applicant , ORG ( ORG ) delivered the following judgment on DATE ( translation from NORP ) :", "\u201c \u2026", "CARDINAL . The appellant submitted that the ORG was not applicable in the instant case since the statements complained of were made disinterestedly with a view to protecting public health and not in a context of competition .", "( a ) The ORG is intended to guarantee , in the interests of all the parties concerned , fair , undistorted competition ( section CARDINAL ) . Consequently , any conduct or commercial practice is unfair if it offends the principle of good faith and affects relations between competitors or between suppliers and customers ( section CARDINAL ORG ) or is apt to affect them ( Cherpillod , \u2018 L\u2019application de la loi contre la concurrence d\u00e9loyale aux journalistes\u2019 , r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of a lecture of DATE , given to ORG , p. CARDINAL ) . When the ORG is applied with a view to preventing distortions in competition in the private sector , however , the conduct of persons who are not in competition with the supplier or customer affected may also be classified as unfair . That is indisputably the position according to current legal theory and the case - law ( BGE CARDINAL IV CARDINAL E. CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . and references , QUANTITY , p. CARDINAL ; Nobel , PERSON GPE f\u00fcr die GPE , in GPE DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ; ORG , PERSON , in ORG droit europ\u00e9en de la concurrence d\u00e9loyale en formation , pp . CARDINAL et seq . and p. CARDINAL ) . Notwithstanding that no competitive relationship is required , only conduct that can be described as an act of competition is prohibited , that is to say acts which are objectively aimed at affecting competitive relationships and not those which take place in a wholly different context . For the purposes of the ORG the conduct of the tortfeasor must therefore be related to the market or competition ( \u2018 marktrelevant , marktgeneigt oder wettbewerbsgerichtet\u2019 \u2013 Schluep , loc.cit . ) . Competition can only exist where the action of the person concerned has , or is apt to have , an effect outside the private sphere ( GPE , Unlauterer Wettbewerb , p. CARDINAL ) . Consequently , the only acts that are competition - related are those which increase or reduce the market share or the rate of success in finding customers of businesses formed with a view to profit or which objectively pursue those aims ( see PERSON , PERSON , CARDINALnd ed . , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . The decisive factor , as the court below rightly pointed out , is economic relevance in the sense of a potential aptitude to affect competition ; for that purpose , an objective aptitude is sufficient and it is of no importance whether there was a subjective intention of intervening in the economic sphere . That being so , it is of no help to the appellant to rely on the academic legal theory that , although the need for a competitive relationship has been dispensed with , an act committed with the intention of affecting competition is required in all cases for there to be an infringement of the ORG ( Nobel , loc . cit . , passim ) . Quite apart from the fact that that theory entails the risk of confusion between the concept of illegality and elements of the notion of fault , the appellant is confusing motive and intention . He does not deny that he is seeking to protect consumers by influencing their behaviour in the market and thereby affecting the sales market for the product he criticises . That clearly shows a competitive intention , even if it is prompted by idealistic motives and not by the pursuit of gain .", "( b ) Scientific research and publications are not in themselves directed at competition if they remain within the academic context ( PERSON , loc . cit . ) . They so become , however , if the target readership may objectively construe the scientific opinions as being designed to influence the behaviour of market players and , in particular , of customers . It is unnecessary to explain this in greater detail where science is used as a disguised means of advertising and where scientific knowledge may serve to boost a product \u2019s sales ( GPE and GPE , GPE , CARDINALth ed . , DATE ... ) . The same must apply , however , where allegedly scientific statements are used in a competitive context to influence negatively the sales of a particular product through denigration of it . Such statements likewise amount to acts of competition covered by the ORG and are subject to its requirement of fairness ( Baumbach and GPE , loc . cit . ) .", "The statements held against the applicant are , in both content and presentation , regard being had in particular to the readership of the periodical concerned , clearly intended to influence the market since , at least objectively , they are unmistakably aimed at deterring consumers from buying and using microwave ovens . They are thus apt to affect competition . That is why ORG rightly considered that they came within the scope of the ORG and therefore examined whether they should be described as unfair within the meaning of that Act .", "CARDINAL . ( a ) The appellant considers that the order prohibiting his using symbols evoking death is contrary to federal law as it was not he who was responsible for the use of the image of the Reaper in the Journal PERSON in respect of which the injunction was imposed and so no recurrence is likely . The ORG emphasised that it remained unproved that the appellant had taken part in the design and editing of the periodical or that his approval had been sought before the article in question appeared . The appellant had , however , become aware of the tenor of the article because he was a subscriber to the review but had not distanced himself from it in any way and had even said , at the trial , that he liked the image of the Reaper . The court concluded that the appellant had knowingly accepted his research paper being used in a simplified and exaggerated manner and had approved the publication in its entirety .", "\u2026", "CARDINAL . ORG prohibited the appellant \u2018 from stating that food prepared in microwave ovens is a danger to health and leads to changes in the blood of those who consume it that indicate a pathological disorder and present a pattern that could be seen as the beginning of a carcinogenic PERSON . The appellant says that that prohibition is contrary to federal law since the prohibited statement is not unfair within the meaning of the ORG and enjoyed the protection afforded to fundamental rights .", "\u2026", "( b ) As already indicated , given the readership to which his statements were addressed and the scientifically unsophisticated content of those statements , the appellant has left the purely academic sphere and entered the realm of competition . He is therefore subject to the fairness requirement laid down by the ORG .", "Section CARDINAL(a ) ORG provides that a person acts unfairly if he denigrates others or the goods , work , services , prices or business of others by making inaccurate , misleading or unnecessarily wounding statements . In the appellant \u2019s defence , it must admittedly be acknowledged that it is not always easy to establish the degree of scientific truth of an assertion , since in this sphere of knowledge , what is held to be true DATE will often be superseded DATE and true again the day after ( GPE and GPE , loc . cit . , ... ) . That does not , however , mean to say that ostensibly scientific views on one \u2019s own work or the work of others in the competition field must always unconditionally be considered fair . When an opinion relating to the market refers to a question that is professionally controversial and is presented as being objectively accurate or scientifically confirmed , that means that the party concerned has opted in favour of a particular opinion and is ready to answer for its accuracy also in the context of competition ( ORG , CARDINAL , in GPE DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) . Positive or negative advertising containing scientific data must , accordingly , in the public interest and in order to ensure effective competition , only be accepted if the data reflect established scientific knowledge or at least if the advertising clearly states that there are differing opinions . If there is no absolute guarantee that the scientific data are correct , the uncritical publication of them is at least deceptive and is accordingly misleading within the meaning of section CARDINAL(a ) ORG ( Baumbach and PERSON , loc . cit . , ... ) . That was so in the instant case . According to ORG there is absolutely no scientific confirmation of the applicant \u2019s argument ; on the contrary , it has been mostly rejected . To hold it out as accurate in the context of competition is unacceptable under section CARDINAL(a ) ORG , and accordingly the injunction issued by ORG does not infringe any provision of federal law .", "( c ) There can be no question of the ORG \u2019s having been applied in breach of LAW or LAW Statutes must , in particular , define fundamental rights and other , conflicting duties of the ORG so that these CARDINAL concerns of constitutional law may be taken into consideration to the greatest possible extent ( PERSON , PERSON schweizerischen ORG , p. CARDINAL ) . This notion of regulation and the values underlying it must also be taken into account in the drafting of statutes . The smooth operation of competition and economic freedom , freedom of expression , scientific freedom and freedom of the press must be guaranteed as well as possible , but at the same time limited so that the various constitutional objectives may be reconciled in practice . In that regard , it should be noted that the ORG provides a remedy only in respect of unfair statements , and the meaning and purpose of freedom of expression or freedom of the press can not be to legitimise unlawful public assertions of that kind . ( PERSON , PERSON des Bundesgesetzes gegen den unlauteren GPE ( GPE ) f\u00fcr die GPE , in ORG CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . Anyone claiming scientific freedom is therefore wholly free to expound his knowledge in the academic sphere but , where competition is concerned , he may not claim to have the truth on his side where the opinion he is putting forward is disputed . An opinion which has not been confirmed scientifically must in particular not be misused as a disguised form of positive or negative advertising of CARDINAL \u2019s own work or the work of others . In the present case , that is all the more true as ORG expressly left the applicant free to base his proposition on new scientific findings .", "CARDINAL . The appeal must therefore be dismissed \u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
