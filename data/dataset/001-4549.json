AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The first applicant is an NORP national , born in DATE . The second applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE . They are living in GPE .", "They are represented before the ORG by Mr. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the second applicant filed a request for a residence permit , indicating that the first applicant and herself intended to get married .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed this request . It noted that under PERSON of the DATE LAW ( Aufenthaltsgesetz ) a quota for issuing new residence permits was fixed DATE . In administering the quota , priority had to be given , inter alia , to cases of family reunion under PERSON of LAW , in which marriage with an NORP citizen had already existed for DATE at the time of the request . However , the second applicant did not fulfil this requirement .", "On DATE the applicants got married . It appears that they were already living together before their marriage .", "On DATE the second applicant , represented by counsel , filed an appeal . She referred in particular to the marriage which she and the first applicant had meanwhile concluded . She further submitted that the first applicant had been living in GPE since DATE . He was employed as a worker and was able to maintain his family .", "On DATE ORG for ORG ) dismissed the appeal . It noted that the quota fixed under PERSON of the DATE LAW was already filled . According to S. CARDINAL of the said LAW , any requests which could not be based on a right to family reunion under LAW had to be dismissed .", "On DATE the second applicant filed a complaint with ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) . She submitted in particular that she had a right to a residence permit under LAW of the DATE LAW in view of her marriage to an NORP national .", "On DATE the second applicant filed a complaint with ORG ) . She submitted that the decision refusing her a residence permit violated her right to respect for her private and family life . She argued in particular that LAW of the DATE LAW granted non - national spouses of NORP nationals the right to a residence permit . However , according to PERSON the right was subject to the condition that the marriage had already lasted for DATE at the time of lodging the request . Such a restriction of the right to a residence permit was contrary to LAW and was , therefore , unconstitutional . The impugned provision obliged an NORP national and his foreign spouse to live separately for DATE . It therefore interfered with their right to private and family life . It was not apparent that this interference served any of the legitimate aims set out in the second paragraph of LAW . LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE LAW might serve to prevent fictitious marriages , the interference was disproportionate as it equally affected spouses truly wishing to lead a marital life . In her case , a separation from the first applicant would be particularly difficult as she was expecting a baby which would be born with a defect of the abdominal wall necessitating an operation immediately after its birth .", "Also on DATE the ORG daughter was born in GPE .", "On DATE the first applicant requested ORG to review the constitutionality of S. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE LAW . He argued that the impugned provision had direct consequences for him . GPE the same arguments as the first applicant he pleaded that the impugned provision was contrary to LAW . Further he argued that it also violated the principle of nondiscrimination as real marriages were treated in the same way as fictitious marriages .", "On DATE ORG refused to deal with the second applicant \u2019s complaint for lack of prospects of success .", "Also on DATE ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s request . It found that PERSON of the DATE LAW was not addressed to or directed against the first applicant . That the impugned provision , being addressed to the second applicant as an alien , produced certain factual consequences for him did not suffice to entitle him to request the review of its constitutionality .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s complaint . It noted that it was uncontested that she had filed her request for a residence permit on DATE while her marriage with the first applicant had only been concluded on DATE . As PERSON of the DATE LAW only conferred a right to a residence permit on the foreign spouse if the marriage with an NORP national had already existed for DATE at the time of filing the request , the second applicant could not rely on this provision .", "This decision was served on the second applicant on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
