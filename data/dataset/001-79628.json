GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and has been placed in a psychiatric clinic ( PERSON ) in Straubing .", "The applicant has been convicted CARDINAL times in DATE , inter alia of fraud in CARDINAL cases ( judgment of the Bad Kissingen ORG of CARDINAL DATE ) and in CARDINAL cases ( judgment of ORG of DATE ) . On the latter occasion , he had been sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "On DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of fraud in CARDINAL cases and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . ORG stressed that the damage which the applicant had caused with his offences amounted to CARDINAL DEM . After having considered an expert opinion by a psychiatrist , ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital because of his diminished culpability ( eingeschr\u00e4nkte GPE ) . According to the expert opinion , the applicant suffered from a severe personality disorder in combination with diminished intelligence . The numerous cases of fraud committed by the applicant were a direct consequence of that personality disorder . The disorder had also been noted in other examinations of the applicant in connection with previous criminal proceedings . The expert opinion stressed that the applicant had built his own dreamworld in which he saw himself as a very wealthy and smart businessman and which was carefully protected from outside social contacts . Because of his diminished intellectual capacity , the applicant lacked the capacity to estimate the consequences of his behaviour . The expert opinion concluded that there was a high danger of recidivism . ORG agreed with this conclusion , given that the lengthy period of imprisonment had not deterred the applicant from committing the above frauds . On DATE , ORG ordered the continuation of the placement .", "I. The decisions during the period DATE", "On DATE , ORG again ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s placement in the hospital and scheduled the next review date for DATE . The court found that it could not be expected that the applicant would not commit any further offences and concluded that the remainder of the sentence could not be suspended on probation . ORG heard the applicant in the presence of his therapist and obtained a statement by the treating doctors of the psychiatric clinic . That statement was explained and discussed during the court hearing . According to the statement , collaboration with the applicant was markedly difficult . There was no sign of understanding of his disorder or a motivation for improvement on the part of the applicant . On the other hand , the applicant sought to live out his need for recognition through numerous legal proceedings , denunciations of clinic staff and disciplinary complaints . For DATE , the therapist had tried to increase trust in order to enable the applicant to settle his disputes without recourse to legal means . As the applicant increasingly adopted realistic views , the treatment showed first signs of success . An essential change in the applicant \u2019s personality could however not be noted . ORG , after having heard the applicant , agreed with the clinic \u2019s statement and found that the applicant \u2019s situation , in particular his need for recognition , had not changed . As the impression which the court obtained from hearing the applicant matched exactly the clinic \u2019s statement , the court saw no need to order an expert opinion by an outside expert .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of ORG of DATE . It found that it had not been necessary to obtain the opinion of an independent expert as the convincing expert opinion of the clinic doctors clearly indicated that a suspension could not be accounted for . The court agreed with the reasoning of ORG that a positive change in the applicant \u2019s personality could not be observed . On the contrary , there existed the risk that the applicant , left at large , would commit further offences in the future which demanded the execution of the placement and continuing treatment . ORG noted that the applicant had announced the submission of an expert opinion ( ORG ) which had not been introduced in time .", "On DATE , ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . It reasoned that the ordinary courts had sufficiently taken into account the applicant \u2019s right to liberty . The courts had considered an expert opinion which at the time had not been DATE together with a statement by the hospital . The latter document had not indicated that the applicant had responded to the treatment . Hence the courts had not been required to order a new expert opinion by an independent expert . It could not be objected to from a constitutional point of view that the courts had made a prognosis which was unfavourable to the applicant and that they did not consider the suspension of the applicant \u2019s placement . On the contrary , the decisions were reasonable given the number of frauds committed by the applicant who had caused considerable damage and the lack of success in treating the applicant \u2019s personality disorder which had abetted those offences .", "The applicant was represented by legal counsel in the above proceedings .", "II .
