On DATE the applicant , who campaigns against abortion , distributed leaflets in the immediate vicinity of the medical practices of anesthetists Dr M. and PERSON , who run a DATE clinic . Furthermore , the applicant deposited leaflets in all letterboxes in the vicinity of the DATE clinic .", "CARDINAL . The front page of the leaflets contained the following text in bold letters :", "\u201c In DATE clinic Dr M./Dr R. [ full names and address ] unlawful abortions are performed \u201d ( \u201c In PERSON . M./Dr . NORP [ ... ] werden rechtswidrige Abtreibungen durchgef\u00fchrt \u201d )", "CARDINAL . Followed by an explanation set in smaller letters :", "\u201c which are , however , allowed by the NORP legislator and are not subject to criminal liability . The attestation of counselling protects the \u201c doctor \u201d and the mother from criminal responsibility , but not from their responsibility before God . \u201d ( \u201c die aber der deutsche ORG erlaubt und nicht unter Strafe stellt . PERSON sch\u00fctzt PERSON \u201c und ORG , aber nicht vor der ORG . \u201c )", "CARDINAL . A box below contained the following text :", "\u201c According to international criminal law : murder is the intentional \u201c bringing - to - death \u201d of an innocent human being ! \u201d ( \u201c PERSON den internationalen GPE : PERSON \u201d eines unschuldigen GPE ! \u201d )", "CARDINAL . On the back of the folded leaflet , the applicant quoted ORG leading judgment with regard to abortion ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as well as a statement by PERSON , the personal physician of PERSON and PERSON , dealing with the role of doctors in relation to voluntary euthanasia and abortion . He also cited section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Law on Conflicts in Pregnancy ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and asked readers to make use of their influence on those performing and assisting in abortions .", "Furthermore , the following text appeared on the back of the folded leaflet :", "\u201c The murder of human beings in FAC was unlawful , but the morally degraded ORG allowed the murder of innocent people and did not make it subject to criminal liability . \u201d ( \u201c PERSON in GPE war rechtswidrig , aber der moralisch verkommene NS - Staat hatte den GPE an den unschuldigen GPE erlaubt und nicht unter Strafe gestellt . \u201d )", "CARDINAL . Below this sentence the leaflet referred to the website \u201c www.babycaust.de \u201d . This website , which was operated by the applicant , contained , inter alia , an address list of so - called \u201c abortion doctors \u201d , in which the DATE clinic and the full names of PERSON and PERSON were mentioned . This list was accessible on the website under the link \u201c death or life\u201d/\u201crequest for prayers for GPE \u201d ( PERSON f\u00fcr GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . Dr M. and PERSON filed a request for a civil injunction against the applicant . They submitted that only legal abortions were performed at DATE clinic . The applicant \u2019s leaflet created the erroneous impression that the abortions performed were contrary to the relevant legal provisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the requested injunction and ordered the applicant to desist from further disseminating in the immediate vicinity of the DATE clinic leaflets containing the GPE names and the assertion that unlawful abortions were performed in the plaintiffs\u2019 medical practice . ORG further ordered the applicant to desist from mentioning the plaintiffs\u2019 names and address in the list of \u201c abortion doctors \u201d on the website \u201c www.babycaust.de \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the statements in the applicant \u2019s leaflet made the incorrect allegation that abortions were performed outside the legal conditions . This was not called into question by the further explanation that the abortions were not subject to criminal liability , as the whole layout of the leaflet was intended to draw the reader \u2019s attention to the first sentence set in bold letters , while the further additions were set in smaller letters with the intent of dissimulating their content . ORG further considered that by singling out the plaintiffs , who had not given him any reasons to do so , the applicant had created a socalled \u201c pillory effect \u201d . The allegations raised by the applicant seriously interfered with the plaintiffs\u2019 personality rights . It followed that the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression had to cede .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the same principles applied to the mentioning of the plaintiffs\u2019 names on the website entitled \u201c babycaust.de \u201d . This implied a connection between the plaintiffs and crimes which were , according to the applicant , comparable to the crimes committed by the NORP during the Holocaust , and was not covered by the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression and had thus not to be tolerated by the plaintiffs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It did not find it necessary to examine whether the text of the leaflets had to be qualified as a statement of facts or as an expression of opinion as , in any event , the applicant \u2019s freedom of opinion had to cede . ORG confirmed ORG assessment that the text in the leaflet implied that the plaintiffs performed unlawful actions . This was not called into question by the further explanations , as the average reader could not be expected to draw the distinction between the act of abortion which was justified under LAW and the act of abortion which was merely exempt from prosecution under LAW CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Seen from a layman \u2019s point of view , the text of the leaflet created the impression that the act of abortion , as permitted by the NORP legislator , amounted to unlawful homicide , or even to murder . The statement was at the very least ambiguous and had not to be tolerated by the plaintiffs .", "CARDINAL . Even if CARDINAL were to assume that the leaflet did not contain a wrong statement of facts , the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression had to cede . ORG reiterated that freedom of expression conveyed the right to express an opinion even in an offending , shocking or disturbing way . If the expression of opinion was part of a debate on matters of public interest , there was an assumption militating in favour of freedom of expression . However , in the instant case the applicant had created a massive \u201c pillory effect \u201d by singling out the plaintiffs , who had not given the applicant any reason to do so . The performance of abortions was criticised with harsh and rigid words . This was further aggravated by the Holocaust reference . ORG further noted that the applicant was not under any specific pressure to express his general criticism of the facilitation of abortions with such a massive violation of the plaintiffs\u2019 personality rights .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further considered that it had not been necessary for the plaintiffs to submit the exact content of the website , as this website was generally accessible and its content was thus known . It then went on to state :", "\u201c The content of the webpage is likewise characterised by the fact that the defendant labels individuals , including the plaintiffs , \u201c abortion doctors \u201d and puts their actions on a level with the national - socialist Holocaust and with mass murder . Therefore , the plaintiffs\u2019 claim to compel the defendant to refrain from performing the impugned action must be granted . In that connection , the court refers to its above reasoning . Furthermore , the defendant himself admitted that he had , on the webpage , labelled the plaintiffs \u201c abortion doctors \u201d who are directly or indirectly involved in the performance of abortions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG did not grant leave to appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request for legal aid , on the ground that the applicant \u2019s intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the judgments of ORG , of ORG and against the decision of ORG . He complained , in particular , that the impugned decisions violated his right to freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a ORG of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s complaint for adjudication for being inadmissible , without providing reasons ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a ORG of CARDINAL judges , granted a further constitutional complaint of the applicant dealing with another set of proceedings before ORG and ORG ( no . DATE ) . In this set of proceedings the courts had granted a civil injunction against the applicant , as ORG and ORG had done in the present case . They had ordered him , inter alia , to desist from disseminating leaflets similar to the ones now in dispute in the immediate vicinity of another gynaecological practice and to desist from publishing on his webpage the information that the doctor in question had performed or assisted in \u201c unlawful \u201d abortions .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the civil injunction had violated the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression as provided in LAW ) because the civil courts had not sufficiently taken into account that the doctor , who had himself publicly announced on the Internet that he performed abortions in his gynaecological practice , had not been confronted with an extensive loss of social reputation as a result of the applicant \u2019s activities . Furthermore , it underlined that the applicant had only blamed the doctor for having carried out allegedly immoral acts , but had not reproached him for having committed acts which were subject to criminal liability or forbidden by law in a wider sense . ORG moreover insisted on the fact that the applicant had contributed to a highly controversial debate of public interest and pointed out that , against the factual background of that case , the courts had not sufficiently clarified why and to what extent the special relationship between the doctor and women searching for counselling and medical treatment in the practice might have been jeopardised ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
