The applicant , PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant and her husband separated and in DATE they were divorced . At about that time , the applicant \u2019s elderly mother went to live with her in the former matrimonial home , which ORG had bought with her ex - husband in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the couple \u2019s separation , proceedings were instigated before ORG concerning the former matrimonial home and its contents . These proceedings were described by Mr Justice PERSON in ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE as substantial and acrimonious ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the former matrimonial home be transferred to the applicant on payment of MONEY ( GBP ) . Although this amount was paid by the applicant on or DATE , the house was not transferred into her sole ownership until after the events in question . Nevertheless , in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found that on payment of the GBP CARDINAL \u201c the beneficial ownership of the property vested in her as sole owner \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the division of the furniture and other moveable property to be found in the former matrimonial home in accordance with a list identified in the order . However , delivery was not effected and on DATE ORG ordered PERSON to make arrangements for the delivery of her ex - husband \u2019s property within DATE . The order was backed by a penal notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant delivered property to her ex - husband which , save for CARDINAL or CARDINAL items , was not that described in the order . As a result , on DATE ORG made an order committing her to prison for DATE . However , this order was suspended for DATE to allow her to deliver the property identified on the list to PERSON on or before DATE . Immediately after the hearing the latter , through his counsel , offered to collect the property to save the applicant the trouble of delivering it . He suggested TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Believing that the applicant had agreed to his suggestion , at TIME on DATE PERSON , accompanied by his brother and sister and a solicitor \u2019s clerk , went to the former matrimonial home to collect his property . Fearing that there would be a breach of the peace ( see paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL below ) because of PERSON previous unwillingness to comply with orders of the court , PERSON solicitors made arrangements for QUANTITY police officers to be present while the property was being removed . When the police officers arrived , they were informed that PERSON was there to collect his property pursuant to an agreement concluded between him and the applicant , and were given a copy of the list but not of the court order . According to CARDINAL of the police officers , the solicitor \u2019s clerk offered to return to his office to get a copy of the order , but the police officer did not require that this be done .", "CARDINAL . One of the police officers knocked at the door of the house . It was answered by the applicant \u2019s mother who told him that her daughter was not at home , and that she was unaware of any arrangement concluded between the latter and PERSON . In an affidavit sworn on DATE , the applicant \u2019s mother claimed that the police officer had told her to open the door because they were from the court and had a court order to execute . The applicant \u2019s mother opened the door and stepped aside , allowing PERSON and his party access to the property . Subsequent court proceedings held that the entry of PERSON , his siblings , and the solicitor \u2019s clerk amounted to a trespass ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Upon entering the house , PERSON and his siblings began removing his property . Although the police officers accompanied them into the house , according to the applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s affidavit the officers spent most of the time on the front driveway . They did not participate in the removal or disturbance of the property , although one of them checked that only the items on the list were removed .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant returned home at TIME , she became angry and objected to the removal of the property . At that stage , one load had been driven away and a second load was in the van , which had been rented by her ex - husband . CARDINAL of the police officers intervened and insisted that she allow PERSON to leave with the property . She was permitted to inspect the contents of the van but the officer insisted that she should not unload items from it because he feared that , if she did so , there was likely to be a breach of the peace . He explained to PERSON that any continuing dispute concerning the property should be resolved later by her and her ex - husband \u2019s respective solicitors . TIME the applicant \u2019s mother , who had recently suffered a stroke , was taken to hospital suffering from high blood pressure .", "CARDINAL . The applicant instituted criminal proceedings against those involved in the incident , which were unsuccessful . Together with her mother , she then instituted CARDINAL sets of civil proceedings for trespass , one against her ex - husband and his siblings , one against the solicitor \u2019s clerk and a third against the QUANTITY police officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother died .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Justice PERSON in ORG dismissed the action against the police officers on the grounds that they had not trespassed on the applicant \u2019s land or goods . Although the judge considered that the applicant had not agreed to her ex - husband removing his property from the former matrimonial home on DATE , he found that the latter genuinely believed that an agreement had been concluded . Furthermore , he considered that the officers had had reasonable grounds for apprehending that a breach of the peace might take place and were therefore entitled , pursuant to the common law as preserved by statute , to enter on and remain at the property without the consent of the owner :", "\u201c The [ applicant ] contends that the police did not have reasonable grounds for apprehending that there might be a breach of the peace and therefore they were trespassers on the property . I reject this contention . They had been told to go to the house on the information of a solicitor that there might be trouble . The history of the matter makes it clear in my judgment that the solicitor \u2019s fears were well - founded . If [ the applicant ] had been there when her ex - husband \u2019s party arrived , I have no doubt that the police constables\u2019 role as peace - keepers would have been required . \u201d", "Regarding the applicant \u2019s claims for trespass to goods , the judge found that the police officers had not actively participated in the removal or the disturbance of the applicant \u2019s property . Although CARDINAL of the police officers had checked that only the items on the list figuring in the court \u2019s order were removed , \u201c he did not encourage or participate in the removal of those things that apparently were on the list or in the way in which things in or on those items were to be dealt with \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG pronounced on the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL remaining civil actions against her ex - husband , his brother and sister and his solicitors . It considered that there had not been any agreement between Ms and PERSON for him to collect his property on DATE and that the applicant \u2019s mother had not given permission to PERSON and his party to enter the house . The court concluded that , as a result , they had trespassed on PERSON land and property . She and her mother \u2019s estate were awarded GBP CARDINAL with interest by way of compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision of Mr Justice PERSON on the ground that the police officers should have made enquiries before entering her house , that there had been no breach of the peace or threat of a breach of the peace and that the police had been negligent in failing to give adequate protection to her mother .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE ( PERSON v. Commissioner of Police of the LOC [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . In his judgment Lord Justice PERSON held :", "\u201c The real issue in the case , as I see it , is whether the officers had any excuse in law for entering [ the former matrimonial home ] . It is common ground that some excuse is required because it does not appear that there was any consent to the entry by [ the applicant ] or her mother . The judge found that they took no active part in removing any property and , as I have said , all [ one of the police officers ] did was to check a list of what was being taken . But it is clear that they both entered the property and it may be that CARDINAL of them knocked on the door .", "There are CARDINAL questions which need to be decided . First , in what circumstances , if any , can police officers enter into a private house to prevent a breach of the peace ? Secondly , if a right to enter a private house does exist in certain circumstances , did those circumstances exist here ? \u201d", "Noting that the common - law powers of the police to enter private premises were preserved by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , the judge considered that the principal authority under common law was the decision of ORG in PERSON ( [ DATE ] ORG Bench Reports CARDINAL ) . Lord Justice PERSON continued :", "\u201c That was a case where police officers went to a hall where a public meeting which had been extensively advertised was about to take place ; the police sergeant in charge of the party was refused admission to the hall but insisted on entering and remaining there during the meeting . The question arose as to whether the police were entitled to take that course .", "Lord PERSON , who delivered the first judgment in the case , said this at page CARDINAL :", "\u2018 I think that there is quite sufficient ground for the proposition that it is part of the preventive power , and , therefore , part of the preventive duty , of the police , in cases where there are such reasonable grounds of apprehension as the justices have found here , to enter and remain on private premises.\u2019", "At page CARDINAL PERSON said , in relation to entering LOC in connection with an affray :", "\u2018 ... I can not doubt that he has a right to break in to prevent an affray which he has reasonable cause to suspect may take place on private premises.\u2019", "He considered , therefore , that the police officers were justified in what they were doing . PERSON at page CARDINAL put the matter as follows :", "\u2018 If a constable in the execution of his duty to preserve the peace is entitled to commit an assault , it appears to me that he is equally entitled to commit a trespass.\u2019 \u201d", "Lord Justice PERSON further considered that another precedent of relevance for the applicant \u2019s case was PERSON v. Chief Police Constable of ORG reported in The ORG on DATE ) :", "\u201c In that case police officers had gone into a house where a child was being held in a man \u2019s arms . The police officers said that they had reason to think that a breach of the peace might occur between the man and his mistress . But a question arose as to whether the mistress had authority to give an invitation to the police officers to come in . The Lord Chief Justice when giving his judgment said :", "\u2018 Regardless of the invitation , there was sufficient [ ground ] to justify the police entering the house on the basis that they genuinely suspected a danger of breach of the peace occurring.\u2019 \u201d", "Lord Justice PERSON then recalled that the judgment in PERSON v. PERSON had been subjected to criticism in that it had appeared to infringe the basic principle that the law would not intervene until an offence had actually been committed . He also noted that it had been suggested that the precedent established in PERSON v. PERSON should be limited to public meetings , and continued :", "\u201c Having the benefit of argument , I am satisfied that ORG in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) [ of LAW ] has now recognised that there is a power to enter LOC to prevent a breach of the peace as a form of preventive justice . I can see no satisfactory basis for restricting that power to particular classes of LOC such as those where public meetings are held . If the police reasonably believe that a breach of the peace is likely to take place on private LOC , they have power to enter those LOC to prevent it . The apprehension must of course be genuine and it must relate to the near future . \u201d", "Mindful of the practical difficulties of using the power correctly and sensibly in domestic situations , Lord Justice PERSON commented that :", "\u201c \u2026 when exercising his power to prevent a breach of the peace a police officer should act with great care and discretion ; this will be particularly important where the exercise of his power involves entering on private property contrary to the wishes of the owners or occupiers . The officer must satisfy himself that there is a real and imminent risk of a breach of the peace , because if the matter has to be tested in court thereafter there may be scrutiny not only of his belief at the time but also of the grounds for his belief . \u201d", "Relying on the facts as established by ORG , Lord Justice PERSON considered that the police officers entered the applicant \u2019s house to prevent a breach of the peace and were reasonable in concluding that there was a danger of such a breach . The other judges , Lords Justices PERSON and PERSON agreed . Leave to appeal to ORG was refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for leave to appeal against ORG decision of DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG refused the application .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act sets out the primary circumstances in which a police constable may enter and search premises . According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) , a police officer may enter any premises for the purposes of saving life or limb or preventing serious damage to property . Whilst section CARDINAL ) abolishes all common - law rules under which a police officer previously had power to enter premises without warrant , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides :", "\u201c Nothing in subsection ( CARDINAL ) affects any power of entry to deal with or prevent a breach of the peace . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Breach of the peace DATE which does not constitute a criminal offence ( NORP v. County ORG , ex parte ORG Commissioner [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Bench Reports CARDINAL ) \u2013 is a common - law concept dating back to DATE . However , as Lord PERSON , giving judgment in ORG in the case of NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Queen \u2019s Bench Reports CARDINAL ) remarked in DATE :", "\u201c A comprehensive definition of the term \u2018 breach of the peace\u2019 has very rarely been formulated \u2026 \u201d ( p. CARDINAL )", "He continued :", "\u201c We are emboldened to say that there is likely to be a breach of the peace whenever harm is actually done or is likely to be done to a person or in his presence to his property or a person is in fear of being so harmed through an assault , an affray , a riot , unlawful assembly or other disturbance . \u201d ( p. CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , in a differently constituted ORG giving judgment in NORP v. Chief Constable of GPE and GPE , ex parte ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG Reports CARDINAL ) , which concerned a protest against the construction of a nuclear power station , Lord PERSON , Master of the Rolls , defined \u201c breach of the peace \u201d more broadly , as follows :", "\u201c There is a breach of the peace whenever a person who is lawfully carrying out his work is unlawfully and physically prevented by another from doing it . He is entitled by law peacefully to go on with his work on his lawful occasions . If anyone unlawfully and physically obstructs the worker DATE by lying down or chaining himself to a rig or the like \u2013 he is guilty of a breach of the peace . \u201d ( p. CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . In a subsequent case before ORG ( PERSON v. Director of Public Prosecutions [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) , Mr Justice PERSON followed ORG , rather than ex parte ORG , in holding that there must be a risk of violence before there could be a breach of the peace . However , it was not essential that the violence be perpetrated by the defendant , as long as it was established that the natural consequence of his behaviour would be to provoke violence in others :", "\u201c The conduct in question does not itself have to be disorderly or a breach of the criminal law . It is sufficient if its natural consequence would , if persisted in , be to provoke others to violence , and so some actual danger to the peace is established . \u201d ( p. DATE )", "CARDINAL . In another case before ORG , PERSON and PERSON v. Director of Public Prosecutions ( [ DATE ] Justice of the Peace Reports CARDINAL ) Lord Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c \u2026 the court would surely not find a [ breach of the peace ] proved if any violence likely to have been provoked on the part of others would be not merely unlawful but wholly unreasonable \u2013 as of course , it would be if the defendant \u2019s conduct was not merely lawful but such as in no material way interfered with the other \u2019s rights . A fortiori , if the defendant was properly exercising his own basic rights , whether of assembly , demonstration or free speech . \u201d ( p. CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . The common - law power of the police to enter private property to prevent a breach of the peace , as preserved by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , was defined by Lord Chief Justice PERSON in PERSON cited above :", "\u201c I think that there is quite sufficient ground for the proposition that it is part of the preventive power , and , therefore , part of the preventive duty , of the police , in cases where there are such reasonable grounds of apprehension as the justices have found here , to enter and remain on private LOC . It goes without saying that the powers and duties of the police are directed , not to the interests of the police , but to the protection and welfare of the public . ( p. CARDINAL )", "\u2026 I am not at all prepared to accept the doctrine that it is only where [ a breach of the peace ] has been , or is being , committed , that the police are entitled to enter and remain on private LOC . On the contrary , it seems to me that a police officer has ex virtute officii full right so to act when he has reasonable ground for believing that [ a breach of the peace ] is imminent or is likely to be committed . \u201d ( p.
