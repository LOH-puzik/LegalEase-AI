IRELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . She is represented before the ORG by PERSON and ORG , a firm of solicitors practising in GPE .", "A.", "The applicant is the natural mother of CARDINAL children born on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and on DATE . At the time of the birth of her third child ( \u201c D \u201d ) , the applicant had a history of substance abuse and of depression . Her relationship ( often violent ) with the father of D had ended , he having commenced a long prison sentence . D was placed in an incubator when he was born until his discharge from hospital on DATE . On DATE , the applicant signed the Admission to Care form to have D placed in pre - adoptive foster care under the supervision of ORG and D was immediately handed over to foster parents . On DATE D was placed with the prospective adoptive parents . On DATE the applicant signed the final consent form for the adoption .", "Having recovered from her drug addiction , the applicant wished to obtain the return of D and to challenge the consent to adoption she had signed . Having received notification dated DATE that the final adoption order would be made , on DATE she requested PERSON ( ORG ) not to proceed with the adoption and on DATE notified ORG orally that she wanted her child back . By letter dated DATE the Registrar of ORG confirmed to the applicant that her consent for the adoption would be regarded as withdrawn .", "In DATE the applicant went to ORG where she was informed that she would have to wait DATE for an appointment to discuss a legal aid application and that there was a DATE delay before ORG could act . She did not , therefore , fill out the necessary legal aid application forms . She returned twice to that office and failed to obtain legal aid or advice . Given that time was of the essence for the applicant , as D was living still with the prospective adoptive parents , she consulted a voluntary agency and a social worker who put her in touch with a firm of solicitors ( her current legal representatives ) . She contacted that firm of solicitors in DATE . The latter took instructions , instructed Counsel and on DATE issued proceedings on behalf of the applicant seeking sole guardianship of the child pursuant to LAW DATE . Since it was clear to her representatives that the applicant , a single impecunious mother , could not discharge their fees , they contacted ORG by telephone in DATE . The latter confirmed that , while the applicant would qualify for legal aid in relation to her means , there remained the issue relating to that ORG \u2019s view of the merits of her case . No legal aid application forms were filled out at that stage .", "On DATE the prospective adoptive parents also issued proceedings to dispense with the applicant \u2019s consent to adoption and seeking sole custody of D for the period required to make the adoption order . The prospective adoptive parents were legally aided . ORG hearing in both proceedings took place DATE in DATE and DATE . ORG heard substantial evidence from social workers , a medical doctor , a psychiatrist , a psychologist , the applicant and from the prospective adoptive parents . It took DATE to deliver the judgment orally ( CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ) . ORG found , on the facts , that the applicant \u2019s consent for adoption had been freely and properly given . As to the best interests of D , it was noted that D had been with the prospective adoptive parents for CARDINAL years and that it was considered that the evidence was that a move at that stage would be traumatic for D and could damage his future capacity to make sound and trusting relationships . It was considered that D had been placed in a household where he would receive great love , care and attention . ORG ordered that the applicant \u2019s consent to adoption be dispensed with pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , that ORG be authorised to make an adoption order and that the prospective adoptive parents have custody of D for DATE , a period calculated to allow the adoption to be completed . ORG made a \u201c strong recommendation that ORG look favourably \u201d on the applicant \u2019s representatives\u2019 request that her costs of the CARDINAL proceedings be discharged by that ORG .", "The applicant \u2019s representatives and ORG subsequently failed to resolve the matter , ORG taking the view that since no application forms had been filled out , no legal aid certificate had issued and that it did not therefore have the power to make the payment , even under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representatives brought the issue of legal costs before ORG .", "On DATE the ORG gave judgment on the costs issue . It commented that the hallmark of the applicant \u2019s case was \u201c meticulous preparation and careful presentation \u201d . It referred to the \u201c modest \u201d sums claimed by the applicant \u2019s representatives and , in that context , noted that the applicant herself had made it clear that she regarded her case as having been fully put before the ORG . It also took note of the applicant \u2019s inability to obtain legal aid or assistance urgently in DATE and that , accordingly , the required forms for applying for legal aid were not filled out at the time . In that court \u2019s view it would have been a grave injustice if the natural mother \u2019s costs were not met because her legal representatives , who presented her case \u201c diligently and ably \u201d , would in practical terms not be remunerated . ORG considered that the applicant would have qualified for legal aid had she applied on time , given the nature of the case and her financial circumstances . It was found that , if an order for costs was made against the prospective adoptive parents , the applicant \u2019s case would fall within the terms of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG . The court therefore made an order for costs against the prospective adoptive parents but put a permanent stay on the order and obtained an undertaking from the applicant not to enforce those costs .", "On DATE ORG gave judgment on the prospective adoptive GPE appeal from this costs order against them . ORG accepted that neither the applicant nor the prospective adoptive parents were in a position to discharge the former \u2019s legal costs . ORG considered that , while the High Court \u2019s order was intended to allow payment to the applicant under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG , ORG had acted without jurisdiction . ORG allowed the prospective adoptive GPE appeal and set aside the order of ORG . The Chief Justice ( with whom CARDINAL of the other judges concurred ) stated , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c I < allow the appeal > with regret because I fully appreciate the efforts made by the solicitor who undertook the case on behalf of the natural mother in accordance with the highest traditions of both branches of the profession , that they were not going to let a person who had the constitutional right of access to the courts be deprived of that by reason of the apparent and alleged delays in the administration of the civil legal aid scheme . It is unfortunate that there should have been such delays if they existed which deprived the natural mother of the possibility of getting a certificate of legal aid in time in order to deal with a matter which was of extreme urgency . The ORG has from time to time been faced with problems caused by delay in the bringing and prosecution of appeals against decisions of ORG in respect of these proceedings and to a very considerable extent , these delays have been substantially contributed to by the costs of the proceedings , the difficulty which existed in obtaining a certificate for the civil legal aid in time in order to bring these proceedings to a fairly rapid conclusion . In many cases because of the delays , the ORG has often found it obliged not to alter the status quo with regard to children involved because they had grown up and were DATE and irrespective of the rights and wrongs , obviously the paramount interest of the child required that they be left where they were irrespective of the merits of the application of the natural mother .", "I have , as I said , felt obliged to allow the appeal \u2026 but do so with regret because it would be much more desirable if access to the courts were made easier for people in the position of the natural mother . She would not have been entitled to or able to avail of that access were it not for the action of her solicitor in undertaking the case and it is in my opinion regrettable that there is not in existence or was not at the time a system whereby a solicitor in the position of the solicitor in this case could obtain reasonable remuneration for his efforts . The problem about making a recommendation to ORG even at this stage is compounded by the fact that they say that they had no power to accede to the recommendation , so no useful purpose would appear to be served in making any further recommendations in this regard . \u201d", "B. Relevant domestic law", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Legal Aid Scheme provides that a certificate which is granted after the commencement of the proceedings in respect of which it is sought will not be extended to cover any action taken or costs incurred prior to the issue of the certificate .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that scheme provides that ORG may make ex gratia payments towards the costs of an unaided person but only in cases where the costs have been awarded against a legally aided person and provided that , inter alia , the proceedings in the court of first instance were instituted by the unsuccessful legally aided person ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
