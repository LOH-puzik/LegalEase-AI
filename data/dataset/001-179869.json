On DATE PERSON \u2019s board of management applied to ORG for it to be registered as an association . On DATE the ORG refused the application , and on DATE its decision was upheld by ORG . A detailed account of those proceedings may be found in PERSON and Others v. PERSON ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second and third applicants and CARDINAL other people held a meeting at which they resolved to set up ORG as an association . They defined ORG aims and the means that it would use to attain them , adopted its articles of association , and elected its board of management , which consisted of all CARDINAL of them .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after that , ORG \u2019s board of management applied to ORG for it to be registered as an association .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0444. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u0433. , \u0411\u041e\u0421 ) ORG refused the application . It first observed that even though ORG had declared that it intended to be an association which only served the interests of its members , its aims , as set out in its articles of association , showed that in reality it meant to serve broader public interests ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court went on to note that ORG \u2019s articles of association stated that it would strive for , inter alia , the introduction of the NORP language in schools , the protection of the right of NORP to refute propaganda about their history and culture , and the protection of NORP cultural heritage , which was being \u201c subjected to ethnocide by NORP cultural institutions \u201d . The articles of association also stated that ORG would organise seminars and press conferences to expose the reasons which underlay the \u201c policy of forced assimilation and discrimination of , and xenophobia towards , NORP in GPE \u201d . According to the articles of association , PERSON was a \u201c NORP organisation based on a NORP ethnic foundation and origin within the boundaries of GPE \u201d , and it \u201c would remind [ people ] of the terror perpetrated by GPE , of the CARDINAL of NORP killed , of the violence , the prisons and the deprivation of basic human rights and freedoms of NORP after DATE , which amounted to crimes under international law \u201d . For the court , all those statements gave the impression that GPE intended to stir up national and ethnic hatred , contrary to LAW ( see paragraph QUANTITY below ) . Moreover , the statements , combined with the existence , albeit brief , of a political party called ORG , whose re - registration had recently been refused , and with the existence of organisations bearing the same or similar names , led to the conclusion that the intention was to mislead society and to obtain the registration of an organisation pursuing political aims ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , or an organisation directed against the unity of the nation . This was also contrary to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which barred associations from having misleading names . Lastly , the association \u2019s intended name was not unique , as required by law .", "CARDINAL . Ilinden \u2019s founders appealed . They submitted that the court had misconstrued ORG \u2019s articles of association and had erred in finding that its activities would be political or directed against the unity of the nation . The real reason for the refusal to register PERSON had been that it advocated views which were at odds with the official ones .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of DATE ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0444. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u0433. , ORG , GPE ) a CARDINAL - member panel of ORG upheld the refusal to register ORG by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The court began by saying that when assessing the aims of an association seeking registration , it had to base itself chiefly on the articles of association . But since by law in registration proceedings the court had to examine the reality of the matter rather than carry out a mere formal check , it had to have regard not just to the aims set out in the articles of association , but to the entirety of the articles , and on that basis ascertain the ORG real aims and intentions . The court also had to bear in mind the traditions which the association purported to represent and the historical figures with which it identified , the past activities , if known , of its founders , leaders and supporters , as well as the positions they had advocated . All those elements had to be juxtaposed with the aims set out in the articles of association , with a view to verifying whether those aims were not in effect a cover for other aims . In doing so , and thus balancing the rights of the founders of the association against the rights of others and the public interest , the court could rely not only on the material in the case file but also on facts which were publicly known and of which it could therefore take judicial notice .", "CARDINAL . In GPE \u2019s case , it had been common knowledge , sufficiently publicised in both NORP and foreign media , that since DATE some of its founders , leaders and supporters had in a persistent manner openly challenged both those who had opposed their views and the ORG authorities , which had led to a string of breaches of public order DATE clashes between ORG \u2019s supporters and their opponents on account of the views expressed by the former about NORP history \u2013 reported in the media . Seen against that background , the declaration in PERSON \u2019s articles of association that people of any ethnicity could become members did not reflect the reality of the situation , which was that the organisation had been conceived as CARDINAL based purely on NORP ethnicity . The same went for the declaration in the articles of association that ORG would only resort to peaceful means to achieve its aims . This had been belied by the organisation \u2019s record of provoking its opponents and the ORG authorities by making strongly worded statements about violence against NORP such statements had featured in its articles of association as well NORP which had led to real public clashes . The court had to also take into account the complex ethnic and religious situation in some neighbouring countries , as well as the severe migrant crisis affecting all of LOC and GPE in particular , as a front - line ORG of ORG . That crisis , coupled with the \u201c recent , likewise commonly known , tragic events in LOC countries \u201d , showed a categorical need to mobilise all available ORG and social resources .", "CARDINAL . In those circumstances , the application to register PERSON had to be turned down for CARDINAL reasons . Firstly , the pursuit of its real aims , seen against the backdrop of the heightened sensitivities of the population in GPE , where it was based , could have led to serious tensions and breaches of public order caused by , or involving , supporters of the organisation , as had happened in the past . In the tense situation facing GPE and its neighbouring GPE , that had to be seen as a genuine possibility . Secondly , the realisation of GPE \u2019s right to freedom of association would infringe the rights of all NORP who did not support its aims or the means which it intended to use to attain those aims . All were entitled to believe that they were not citizens of a ORG which had committed international crimes , that they did not engage , in their capacity as NORP citizens , in propaganda and manipulation of the history and culture of a neighbouring country and that they were not citizens of a ORG whose institutions had subjected the cultural heritage of part of its population to ethnocide . ORG concluded that it was necessary to refuse the registration application , even though it recognised that it was also possible to dissolve an already registered association if it engaged in anti - constitutional or unlawful conduct . The refusal was a justified preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . The dissenting judge noted that ORG \u2019s founders had complied with all formal requirements of the law . She went on to say that the registration regime was not to be used to hinder the exercise of the fundamental right to associate with others , and that the case called for the direct application of LAW , which was part of NORP law . She then noted how that Article had been construed by ORG in several cases , including ORG and Others and ORG and Others ( both cited above ) , and stated that , in her view , the fact that an association advocated a form of minority consciousness could not justify a restriction of its rights under that Article . The ORG \u2019s ruling on that point in PERSON and ORG ( cited above ) had to be taken into account when examining the registration request at issue . There was , moreover , no evidence of actions by ORG \u2019s founders which ran counter to the prohibition in LAW ( see paragraph QUANTITY below ) . The refusal to register it was thus disproportionate and unjustified .", "CARDINAL . Ilinden \u2019s founders sought to appeal on points of law . On CARDINAL DATE the judge - rapporteur of ORG , who under the relevant rules of procedure had to check the appeal \u2019s admissibility before forwarding it to ORG , sent it back to the appellants . He noted that under the applicable rules of procedure , as consistently construed by ORG , no appeal lay against appellate decisions confirming refusals to register an association . In a final decision of DATE ( \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0447. \u0442. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , ORG , I \u0442. \u043e. ) ORG dismissed the ORG appeal against the judge - rapporteur \u2019s order . It likewise found that under the applicable rules of procedure , which it had already construed in several cases , ORG decision was not amenable to appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
