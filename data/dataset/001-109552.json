The applicant was born in GPE in DATE to NORP parents . Her father was arrested DATE . In DATE the family learned of his death . In DATE the applicant \u2019s mother was arrested . In DATE the applicant and her mother were deported to the concentration camp in GPE . They were transferred to the concentration camp in ORG in DATE and were liberated DATE . After having spent DATE in camps for displaced persons , the applicant and her mother emigrated to GPE in DATE . The applicant is still living in GPE , where she resides in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant married in DATE . She has CARDINAL children born in DATE , DATE and DATE . She worked as a practising lawyer and notary public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an amendment to ORG ( Allgemeines Sozialversicherungsgesetz ) entered into force , creating additional possibilities of obtaining pension entitlements for persons who had been prevented from accumulating insurance periods by their arrest , punishment , detention , unemployment , denaturalisation or emigration as a result of ORG persecution .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant requested ORG ( Pensionsversicherungsanstalt ) to apply these provisions to her case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a declaratory decision stating that the applicant was entitled to pay insurance contributions in respect of periods of emigration DATE and DATE a total of CARDINAL insurance DATE pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) taken in conjunction with section PERSON ) of ORG . Moreover , certain periods of secondary and university education were accepted as substitute periods ( PERSON ) provided that contributions were paid in respect of periods of emigration .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE ORG informed the applicant that she would have to pay MONEY ( ORG ) per month , making a total amount of ORG for DATE . By making this payment by CARDINAL DATE at the latest she would be entitled to a DATE pension of ORG CARDINAL plus CARDINAL additional payments in the same amount per year , with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision of DATE , arguing , inter alia , that periods of child - raising should be counted for the purpose of calculating her pension . Not doing so would discriminate against her in relation to women who had not been forced to emigrate and had thus raised their children in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Amt der Landesregierung ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that ORG had correctly applied sections CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of ORG by declaring that the applicant was entitled to a maximum of DATE between DATE , when she had reached DATE , and DATE . Periods of secondary and university education abroad in DATE were accepted as substitute periods pursuant to LAW taken in conjunction with sections PERSON ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) . However , section CARDINAL and the subsequent sections of ORG did not provide for periods of child - raising within the meaning of section CARDINALa to be counted as substitute periods .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ) , alleging that LAW breached the principle of equality as guaranteed by LAW . She argued in particular that excluding periods of child - raising on the ground that they were spent abroad ran counter to the underlying intention of the rules concerning preferential treatment of persons who had suffered disadvantages in their social security status during the ORG era . These rules were aimed at eliminating the financial disadvantages suffered by victims of ORG under social security law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to deal with the applicant \u2019s complaint for lack of prospects of success . It observed that in an area such as the present one , concerning special provisions giving preferential treatment to a particular group of persons under social security law , the legislature had a wide margin of appreciation in assessing whether events which occurred abroad were to be treated on an equal footing with events that occurred in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Following a request by the applicant ORG referred the case to ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) . Before that court the applicant repeated in essence the arguments she had raised before ORG . She asserted in particular that , having regard to the aim pursued by LAW and the fact that periods of secondary and university education abroad were accepted as substitute periods , the lack of a provision including periods of child - raising abroad as substitute periods could only be regarded as an omission . The authorities should have closed this unintended gap in the law by accepting periods of child - raising abroad as substitute periods .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint as being unfounded . It noted that LAW and its subsequent sections were aimed at eliminating disadvantages in accumulating insurance periods which victims of ORG had suffered on account of their persecution or emigration . The law did not require there to be an actual causal link between persecution and the loss of insurance periods . It proceeded from the assumption that without the persecution , insurance periods would have been accumulated , and provided for overall crediting ( pauschalierte PERSON ) of contribution periods or substitute periods to compensate for periods of persecution or emigration .", "ORG went on to hold :", "\u201c In such a system , a teleological gap can not in principle result from the fact that the legislature has not extended the crediting of periods of child - raising in GPE under section CARDINALa of ORG to persons who , for reasons linked to persecution within the meaning of section CARDINAL , live abroad during periods of child - raising . Section CARDINALa has a similar ( substitute ) function in that it likewise provides for the crediting for insurance purposes of periods during which the person concerned was prevented from accumulating insurance periods ( in this instance , on account of child - raising ) . In so far as the legislature already compensates for the loss of insurance periods as a result of persecution , no further compensation is needed . In so far as it does not make such provision , there is no difference in relation to other persons who are resident abroad : on account of the territoriality principle applicable under the social security scheme , the crediting of insurance periods in accordance with section CARDINALa of ORG would in any event require an equalisation arrangement through an international agreement and , moreover , decisions in such matters would be taken not in administrative proceedings but in proceedings concerning benefit entitlements .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG does not alter this finding in any way . This provision has CARDINAL aims : it ensures that periods of schooling that were interrupted as a result of persecution are regarded as completed ( thus constituting a situation giving rise to preferential treatment under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) , and it places school and university attendance abroad and in GPE on an equal footing . This equal treatment is admittedly of significance for benefit entitlement ( and not only for the application of preferential treatment on the basis of emigration ) . However , as such it falls within the discretion enjoyed by the legislature in matters of legal policy . No further inferences are to be drawn from this in terms of the principle of equality , especially not in the manner argued by the complainant . \u201d", "Finally , ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s complaint failed to give more detailed reasons as to why accepting periods of child - raising abroad as substitute periods was objectively required .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The General Social Security Act ( Allgemeines Sozialversicherungs - gesetz ) regulates health and accident insurance and old - age pension insurance for persons employed in GPE , based on the contributory principle .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the General Social Security Act regulates compulsory affiliation to the social security system . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) , employees are affiliated to the health and accident insurance scheme and to the old - age pension scheme . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) defines an employee as any person working in consideration of remuneration in a relationship of personal and economic dependency . For an employee affiliated to the social security system , compulsory contributions have to be paid in part by the employer and in part by the employee .", "CARDINAL . Entitlement to an old - age pension arises when a person who has reached pensionable age has accumulated a sufficient number of insurance DATE , the required minimum being DATE .", "CARDINAL . When calculating the number of insurance DATE , certain periods during which no gainful activity has been pursued , and thus no contributions have been made , are nevertheless taken into account as substitute periods , for instance periods of secondary or university education , child - raising , unemployment , or military or alternative service .", "CARDINAL . The relevant rules on substitute periods are laid down in sections CARDINAL , CARDINALa and CARDINAL of ORG . The following provisions are relevant in the context of the present case .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) regulate in detail which periods of secondary education and university education in GPE are to be credited as substitute periods .", "Section CARDINALa of ORG provides that periods which the insured person has spent exclusively or mainly raising his or her child are to be counted as substitute periods up to a maximum of DATE , starting with the birth of each child , if the period of child - raising was spent in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of ORG provides that persons who , DATE and DATE , suffered a disadvantage in their social security status for political reasons \u2013 except in connection with ORG activities DATE or on account of their religion or race are to receive preferential treatment .", "CARDINAL . The details regarding this preferential treatment are regulated in the subsequent sections and differ according to whether the person emigrated or not . The relevant provisions were enacted in DATE and have subsequently been amended several times .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that persons who emigrated during the above - mentioned period and had accumulated insurance periods or substitute periods prior to that time are entitled to pay retroactive contributions ( of approximately ORG DATE ) for periods of emigration up to DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section PERSON ) , in the version in force since DATE , persons who emigrated but had , for reasons beyond their control , not accumulated any insurance periods or substitute periods before their emigration are also entitled to pay retroactive contributions if they were born on or before CARDINAL DATE and were resident in GPE on that date . Retroactive contributions can be made with effect from the person \u2019s fifteenth birthday at the earliest . A further provision ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) limits the possibility of making retroactive contributions to CARDINAL insurance months .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , periods of secondary education or university education abroad DATE and DATE are to be dealt with in the same way as periods falling under sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) . In essence , that means that such periods are to be counted as substitute periods , in the same way as periods of secondary education or university education spent in GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
