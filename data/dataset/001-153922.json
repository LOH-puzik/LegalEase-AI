The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested in the GPE on DATE . On DATE , following transfer to GPE , he was charged with the attempted importation of QUANTITY ( compressed weight ) of cocaine with a potential street value of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Prior to trial , in order to seize and preserve the applicant \u2019s assets for future confiscation in the event of a conviction , the prosecution applied for and obtained a restraint order and the appointment of a receiver under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The receiver sought to sell the applicant \u2019s horses immediately and this was successfully challenged by the applicant . In its judgment dated DATE ORG confirmed that the purpose of the DATE Act was to preserve the value of assets for the purpose of future confiscation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Also prior to trial , the applicant sought to challenge the admissibility of telephone interception evidence obtained in the GPE . He ultimately pursued an appeal to ORG , which delivered its judgment against the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The trial subsequently commenced in ORG in DATE . However , after the jury had already retired to consider their verdict a prejudicial document was discovered within the jury bundle . The fault for this lay with the prosecution , a matter admitted at the time . Consequently , on DATE the jury were discharged .", "CARDINAL . A retrial commenced on DATE . At the start of the retrial the applicant \u2019s counsel pursued an unsuccessful application to stay the proceedings on grounds of hardship suffered as a result of the prosecution \u2019s negligence in causing the first trial to be abandoned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was found guilty of the offences charged . On DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . He lodged an appeal against sentence , which was unsuccessful . In DATE he lodged an out - of - time appeal against conviction . He was released from prison in DATE and , on DATE , he abandoned his appeal ( see further paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE LAW provides for the making of a confiscation order in the event of a conviction for drug trafficking offences . Accordingly , prior to the sentencing hearing , the prosecution served notice under LAW of its intention to seek a confiscation order and a statement under section CARDINAL of the LAW containing the prosecution \u2019s assessment of whether the applicant had benefited from drug trafficking and the value of his proceeds of drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . At the sentencing hearing on DATE , the judge ordered the defence to serve a written response to the prosecution \u2019s statement within DATE . The defence failed to serve its response within the DATE period . At the prosecution \u2019s request , a further procedural hearing took place on DATE . At this hearing , the judge was informed that the delay in serving the defence response had been caused by the applicant moving prisons and wishing to instruct new solicitors . The prosecution drew the judge \u2019s attention to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , which provided a DATE deadline in respect of the confiscation proceedings . Prosecution counsel indicated that an extension of the deadline might be required . Defence counsel confirmed that the applicant wished to apply for a transfer to new solicitors and agreed that an extension would probably be required as it was unlikely that a fresh legal team would be ready by DATE when the current deadline was due to expire . The judge granted a short adjournment of DATE to resolve the matter of transferring representation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court granted a defence application for the transfer of legal aid . The new defence representative sought an adjournment of DATE to allow new counsel to receive the papers and take instructions from the applicant . The prosecution did not oppose the application but reminded the judge that under LAW , the judge needed to find \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d before the timetable could be extended beyond the DATE deadline . Defence counsel was unable to address the judge on the point of \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d owing to his lack of familiarity with the case . Accordingly , the matter was adjourned to DATE to review progress .", "CARDINAL . On DATE defence counsel indicated to the judge that , owing to the complexities of the case , he would not have a defence response prepared before DATE . He also indicated that a contested hearing , which the parties now appeared to consider necessary , would require a DATE time estimate . The judge was again referred to section CARDINAL of the DATE Act and it was decided with the agreement of all parties to postpone the confiscation timetable to DATE pursuant to the court \u2019s powers under that section . The judge suggested DATE of DATE for the substantive confiscation hearing .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE , the defence gave notice that it wished to challenge the validity of the postponement of the confiscation hearing on the basis that ORG had no jurisdiction because procedural requirements had not been properly followed by the judge at the hearing on DATE . The judge set a timetable for the service of skeleton arguments on the jurisdiction point and fixed DATE for legal argument on the matter .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , as a result of informal discussions between junior counsel for both sides regarding a case pending before ORG on the jurisdiction point , DATE was vacated . In the event , the pending appeal case was subsequently conceded by the prosecution so no oral argument took place in that case . A review hearing in the applicant \u2019s case was scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the hearing on DATE it became apparent that the parties had misunderstood each other in agreeing to vacate DATE . Counsel for the defence had understood that if the appeal in the other case was decided in the appellant \u2019s favour , the prosecution in the applicant \u2019s case would terminate the confiscation proceedings against him . Counsel for the prosecution denied that such an undertaking was ever made . Counsel for the defence indicated his intention to argue abuse of process on the basis that an undertaking had been given and was then reneged upon .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the prosecution indicated its intention to proceed with the confiscation hearing on DATE , as planned . The defence requested that legal argument on jurisdiction and abuse of process be postponed to suit the diary of leading counsel . The judge noted that it was \u201c a supreme irony frankly ... that this case was adjourned solely for Mr ORG benefit and he now has the temerity to say that there is no jurisdiction to try him . \u201d He also commented that since the prosecution had produced its statement under LAW of LAW before the sentencing hearing on DATE , Mr PERSON had done absolutely nothing . The judge indicated his preference for retention of the DATE for the substantive hearing with any legal argument to take place beforehand , suggesting that alternative leading counsel could be found . Defence counsel proposed instead that the DATE be set down for legal argument and after that , unless the confiscation proceedings had fallen away , the defence would serve their response by DATE The judge reluctantly put back the substantive confiscation proceedings until DATE , noting that he was \u201c very loath to have further slippage than is absolutely necessary \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL defence applications submitted by newly instructed leading counsel were heard . The first was to stay the confiscation proceedings on grounds of abuse of process ; the second was for an order declaring that there was no jurisdiction to continue the confiscation proceedings on account of the judge having failed to observe the proper procedural requirements when he postponed the confiscation hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his ruling of CARDINAL DATE the judge found , in relation to the jurisdiction point that the original adjournment was to afford the defence more time , that no defence response had been forthcoming to the prosecution statement and that further delay had been caused by the applicant wishing to instruct new solicitors . He indicated that he had listed the case on DATE , DATE before the DATE time - limit expired , and that on that date he had postponed the listing to CARDINAL DATE in compliance with section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . He further found that no prejudice had been caused to the applicant as a result of the postponement . Accordingly , he concluded that the court had jurisdiction to deal with the confiscation proceedings . On the issue of abuse of process , the judge ruled that there had been a misunderstanding between counsel as to whether any undertaking had been given and that no abuse therefore arose . Following the ruling , the confiscation proceedings were adjourned and fixed for DATE to allow the defence to prepare their case .", "CARDINAL . Further argument then took place in relation to the jurisdiction point following a ORG judgment on DATE in which a confiscation order was quashed following a finding that a ORG judge had not complied with the requirements of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . The applicant asked the judge to reconsider his ruling of CARDINAL DATE . The judge considered the applicant \u2019s case to be distinguishable on the facts . However , on the request of the defence and following advice from both parties that an interlocutory appeal could be completed quickly and that the DATE confiscation hearing would not need to be vacated , he certified the point as fit for appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant duly lodged an appeal on the jurisdiction point . For unknown reasons , matters proceeded more slowly than the parties had expected and the DATE confiscation hearing did not go ahead . A further judgment in a similar appeal was handed down by ORG on DATE ( NORP v ORG ( PERSON ) and others [ DATE ] PERSON ) . An appeal against that judgment was lodged with ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s case was adjourned further in DATE and DATE on application by him under section CARDINAL of LAW , the \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d being the pending ORG appeals . The parties were requested to keep the court updated . The applicant was subsequently informed by letter from ORG dated DATE that a question had been certified for ORG in the case of ORG and others and that all similar appeals , including his own , would be held in abeyance until that appeal had been decided by ORG .", "CARDINAL . As a result of this , and disclosure issues in relation to the receiver , the matter was further postponed in DATE until DATE by which time ORG had not issued a judgment in ORG and others . The judge allowed a DATE adjournment to obtain an update from the judicial office of ORG . He was reminded by the applicant that he would again need to formally postpone the confiscation hearing . The judge proposed a further DATE postponement , on the proviso that he be provided with more up to date information in a DATE \u2019s time and that if the proceedings could be listed and dealt with before the DATE period had expired , the parties should arrange this . Both counsel agreed .", "CARDINAL . Further hearings took place in DATE and DATE . However , ORG had still not issued a judgment . Further postponements were ordered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge was informed that the applicant had lodged an out - of - time appeal with ORG against his conviction . Accordingly , there was little point in fixing a date for a substantive hearing in the confiscation proceedings . The applicant suggested a postponement to DATE . The judge agreed to the postponement on condition that the parties kept him informed of any progress in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG handed down their judgments in CARDINAL jurisdiction appeals ( R v ORG and others [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ; and R v ORG and another [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) . It upheld the confiscation orders , stating that any prejudice caused to the defendants by delay was outweighed by the public interest in not allowing convicted offenders to escape confiscation for bona fide errors in the judicial process .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a procedural hearing was held in ORG in the applicant \u2019s case . The applicant \u2019s counsel acknowledged that ORG judgment effectively ruled out the prospect of a successful appeal on jurisdiction . The applicant requested a further adjournment to allow the parties to discuss matters further and agree amongst themselves a convenient date in DATE for the next hearing . The judge agreed to an adjournment . It is unclear whether a hearing took place in DATE or whether further adjournments were agreed in light of the applicant \u2019s pending appeal against conviction .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , from DATE , separate hearings were held in ORG relating to the applicant \u2019s appeal against conviction . On DATE , the applicant was released from prison , having served CARDINAL of his sentence . On DATE , apparently following adverse outcomes on various issues relating to his appeal , the applicant abandoned his appeal against conviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at a review hearing in the confiscation proceedings , the applicant informed the court that he had a large number of witnesses and a great deal of work was yet to be done . The applicant \u2019s counsel gave notice of a potential abuse argument arising from the deaths of CARDINAL of his witnesses . The judge fixed a timetable for further proceedings , including the lodging of an amended \u201c section CARDINAL statement \u201d by the prosecution and reply by the applicant . The matter was listed for a hearing in DATE . The prosecution served the amended statement in DATE . At the hearing on DATE it was agreed to seek suitable dates in DATE .", "CARDINAL . At a directions hearing on DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel again raised issues relating to the volume of work and requested until DATE to respond to the prosecution \u2019s \u201c section CARDINAL statement \u201d . The judge extended the deadline to DATE and ordered that the prosecution serve any further response within DATE . A procedural hearing was agreed for DATE . The judge further extended the deadline for the confiscation hearing on the grounds of \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d , stating that this was \u201c a wholly exceptional case \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At the procedural hearing on DATE the applicant proposed DATE for the substantive confiscation hearing and assured the judge that the hearing would not last longer than DATE . The judge was scheduled to start a complex trial on DATE to last until DATE . He therefore listed the applicant \u2019s case for DATE . On DATE the parties appeared before the judge . The applicant \u2019s counsel informed the judge that , contrary to previous advice to the court , DATE would be insufficient for the substantive hearing as he now wished to call more witnesses than had originally been indicated . The judge \u2019s other commitments precluded a rescheduled hearing taking place before DATE and counsel could not agree on dates after DATE . The judge decided to keep the hearing fixed for DATE to clarify the situation as to dates . The matter was further adjourned at hearings that took place in DATE and DATE . The substantive hearing was listed for DATE , with a time estimate of DATE , but in fact lasted DATE from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The judge delivered his ruling on the confiscation on DATE . He identified the total amount of the applicant \u2019s benefit from criminal conduct as ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . He found the principal realisable asset to be a farm , which was valued at GBP MONEY . A confiscation order was made , with a DATE term of imprisonment to be served consecutive to the main sentence in default of payment . In his judgment , the judge also addressed the question of delay , noting that the delay incurred resulted partly from the applicant \u2019s desire to challenge the jurisdiction of the court , partly from his appeal to ORG and partly from his decision to change his legal representatives .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the judge to vary the confiscation order and reopen his findings on the delay issue on the basis of the judgment of this Court in GPE and PERSON v. GPE , no . PERSON , DATE . The judge declined , noting that it was now for the applicant to seek other remedies .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied , out of time , to ORG for leave to appeal the confiscation order . He argued , first , that the judge had erred in including the current value of the farm within the benefit figure of the proceeds of drug trafficking ; and , secondly , that the delay in the disposal of the confiscation proceedings had breached his right to a fair trial and to a trial within a reasonable time under LAW .", "CARDINAL . An oral hearing took place before the full court to decide upon both leave to appeal and the merits on DATE . ORG granted leave to appeal but dismissed the appeal itself , upholding the confiscation order and finding no violation of LAW . As regards the delay complaint , the court considered the whole period from the applicant \u2019s arrest in DATE to the making of the confiscation order in DATE . It indicated that the delay :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... raises a prima facie case of a significant breach of LAW . Unless there is a satisfactory explanation for it , it is a chronology which is way , way below the standards which are expected and achieved in the courts of this country . ...", "CARDINAL . ... We start with the proposition that the passage of such a length of time as we have described calls for the most careful investigation and detailed justification . It is simply on the face of it well beyond acceptable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court found that the period from the applicant \u2019s arrest in DATE to the conclusion of his first trial on DATE was wholly unexceptional and reasonable . As to the period between the discharge of the jury in the first trial to the conclusion of the second trial in DATE , a period of DATE , the court accepted that the abandonment of the first trial was the fault of the prosecution , noting :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The trial had to start all over again . It was not concluded by conviction at DATE second trial until DATE . There is thus a period of DATE from DATE until CARDINALth DATE which was an unnecessary delay attributable to the error , although in good faith , made on behalf of the prosecution by some junior clerk . That period is therefore potentially available to be considered as the responsibility of the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court then examined the delay from DATE second trial in DATE until DATE , when the ORG of Lords\u2019 judgment in the jurisdiction appeals was handed down . It observed that at the outset of this period , the confiscation proceedings were moving in good time . The court considered that there would have been a hearing of the confiscation question in about DATE or DATE , if that probable timetable had not been overtaken by the applicant \u2019s challenge to the court \u2019s jurisdiction , of which the court noted;.", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... He was entitled to do so . The issue was raised before the trial judge in the early part of DATE ... The controversy as to the correct construction of the confiscation legislation was not resolved until the decision of ORG in R v PERSON and GPE ... In fact the question raised and decided went further than simply the confiscation legislation . It bore on a broader question of when technical failure to abide exactly by prescribed procedure has the effect of nullifying the subsequent actions of courts which is , of course , a very large general question . \u201d", "ORG considered that it was in the applicant \u2019s interests to await the eventual authoritative ruling of ORG . It therefore concluded that the delay that arose in this respect could not be criticised .", "CARDINAL . In the period from DATE until the applicant abandoned his appeal against conviction in DATE , the court considered that the delay was the result of the appeal lodged \u201c long out of time \u201d , noting :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Whilst an appeal against conviction was outstanding there could not of course sensibly be a confiscation hearing because if the defendant \u2019s conviction disappeared so would any prospect of confiscation . \u201d", "The court observed that the applicant had engaged a third counsel for the appeal , and pursued it on grounds that had never been supported by those who had conducted his trial . It further noted that the various grounds advanced by the applicant fell away CARDINAL by CARDINAL over that period , but CARDINAL of them remained and was not finally laid to rest until DATE . The court concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The simple fact is that the appeal on this ground , as on the others , had always been without any proper basis or merit . It is this additional period to which we referred prospectively earlier on as an example of the defendant taking the course that he is quite entitled to do \u2013 leaving no legal stone unturned \u2013 but adding to the passage of time as a result . We are satisfied that nothing in that period can be called unreasonable delay attributable to the act or omission of the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the period DATE , when the confiscation order was eventually made , ORG noted that the parties had returned promptly to ORG for the resumption of the confiscation issue within TIME of the abandonment of the appeal against conviction . It was apparent at the hearing of DATE that the prosecution was pressing for a short timetable . The applicant \u2019s representatives , on the other hand , wanted a longer timetable and were seeking additional time on the grounds that they had an enormous volume of work and would be calling a large number of witnesses , and might even be mounting an abuse argument on the grounds that some potential witnesses had died . Hearings were adjourned owing to the applicant \u2019s applications . Although ORG did not blame the applicant for his conduct , the court made it clear that any additional passage of time as a result of that conduct was not attributable to any act of the ORG . It observed in particular that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... At CARDINAL such hearing , in DATE , the defendant through his lawyers indicated that there would be CARDINAL witnesses necessary to be examined at the confiscation hearing ... [ that ] was eventually set down for DATE , taking into account the potentially large number of witnesses and time that would be needed . At that stage the estimate , which according to LANGUAGE practice will have been an estimate contributed to by both parties , was DATE . That is a very long time for a confiscation hearing but if the time has to be found it has to be found . However , that date had to be broken on the application of the defendant because they assured the judge that they had so many witnesses to call that in fact DATE would be needed , that is DATE , to hear the confiscation question . In the end , the defendant called CARDINAL ( not DATE ) witnesses and CARDINAL of those was himself . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court commented on the time taken by ORG judge to deliver his ruling ( CARDINAL after the conclusion of the confiscation hearing ) as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... We do not doubt that that will be attributable to the demands made on the judges at ORG , but it is too long and that period , or at least part of it , is no doubt the responsibility of the State . Judgments of this kind ought to be delivered within , at the very least , DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Looking at the passage of time as a whole , the court concluded that there had not been in the applicant \u2019s case unreasonable delay attributable to the acts of the ORG . The court also considered the impact of the passage of time upon the applicant , and acknowledged that he and his wife lived throughout this time with the uncertainty of whether they would lose his family home . However , given that his assets remained the same throughout the whole period and that he continued to enjoy his home which might have otherwise been taken from him earlier , the court had very little doubt about where the balance of advantage lay . It concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The reality of this case is that this was a defendant of resourceful approach who deployed every possible legal stratagem to delay the confiscation process . He can not now be heard to say that as a result of his having succeeded in delaying it , it has become unfair for the confiscation order to proceed . If there had been unreasonable delay attributable to the ORG , in the absence of any possible damage to the defendant beyond the very limited uncertainty that we have mentioned we are quite satisfied that this could not possibly have been a case in which the appropriate remedy would have been a stay of the confiscation process for abuse of process . There would simply have been nothing remotely unfair about the defendant eventually having to disgorge the confiscation which was the consequence of his offending . The appropriate remedy would , hypothetically , as it seems to us , have been a declaration . But that does not in the end arise . It follows that the substantive ground ... in relation to LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Since the lodging of his application to this ORG , a further judgment has been handed down by ORG on DATE , substantially reducing the amount of assets payable under the confiscation order ( ORG v ORG [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
