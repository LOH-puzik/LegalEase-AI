The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of wounding ( the deliberate shooting of a police officer ) with intent to resist arrest , for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment . He was also sentenced to concurrent terms of DATE for attempted robbery and firearms offences . His tariff was set at DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon the expiry of his tariff , the applicant \u2019s detention was reviewed by a \u201c Discretionary Lifer Panel \u201d ( \u201c DLP \u201d ) of ORG . At the time of his review , the applicant was a \u201c category B \u201d prisoner ( prisoners being given a security classification ranging from category A ( most serious ) to category D ) . Life prisoners are normally expected to pass through each of the categories prior to release . While he would therefore ordinarily have been expected to progress to a category C prison before being considered suitable for transfer to a category D ( \u201c open \u201d ) prison , the applicant applied to be transferred directly to an open prison . His legal representative at the review hearing made it clear that he was seeking a transfer only , not release on licence .", "CARDINAL . Among the material which the ORG had before it were CARDINAL reports ( from ORG , the prison probation officer , and PERSON , a psychiatrist commissioned on behalf of the applicant ) which recommended a transfer of the applicant to a category D prison . Those reports stated that the applicant needed to be tested with a view to preparing him and considering him for release on licence , and that such testing could not take place in a category C prison and needed to take place in category D conditions . They were of the view that the risk to the safety of the public of a transfer to category D was acceptable . The third report in front of the ORG from PERSON , a visiting consultant psychiatrist , was unfavourable to the applicant and neither recommended transferring him to category D nor directing his release . Mr PERSON and PERSON gave oral evidence to the ORG . Dr ORG did not . The conclusions of the latter were criticised by Dr PERSON as being unsupported by evidence or reasoning .", "CARDINAL . The ORG did not recommend that the applicant should be released . However , it recommended that he should be transferred from a category B to a category D prison . Were that recommendation not to be accepted by the Secretary of ORG , the ORG recommended an early review after DATE ( i.e. in DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The decision letter of the ORG to the applicant of DATE stated , in relevant part :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Crime ( Sentences ) Act DATE requires ORG to direct your release only if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that you be confined . The panel of ORG who considered your case on DATE were not so satisfied and therefore have not directed your release at this stage . This decision is binding upon the Secretary of ORG .", "...", "CARDINAL . NORP In reaching their decision that you are not yet suitable for release on licence , the panel took particular account of the contents of the reports which were before them , most of which did not recommend release and concluded that you remain a risk , at least until further work has been done on social skills and enhanced thinking . The panel noted the fact that your representative expressly stated that she did not ask for a recommendation for release at this stage .", "CARDINAL . NORP The panel recommended to the Secretary of ORG that you should be transferred to a category D prison . They made this recommendation on the basis of the opinions expressed by PERSON and Dr PERSON that while recognising the progress which you have made , and improved behaviour and attitude , further work remains to be done , but that this could more appropriately be carried out in open conditions , which would give an opportunity to test out your commitment in less structured conditions which are closer to the community . The panel concluded , on the basis of the opinions of these witnesses , that the risk of a transfer to category D conditions would be acceptable .", "CARDINAL . NORP The panel preferred the evidence and report of Dr PERSON to the report of PERSON . The panel felt that PERSON conclusions ( upon which the Secretary of ORG relied ) were not supported by evidence or by any reasoning which preceded them .", "CARDINAL . NORP The panel made no recommendation to the Secretary of State with regard to an early review . However , in the event of the Secretary of ORG not accepting the panel \u2019s recommendation for transfer to category D conditions , the panel would recommend an early review in DATE time , and would hope that consideration would be given to a transfer to less secure conditions meanwhile .", "CARDINAL . The decision not [ to ] release you is binding upon the Secretary of ORG but it is for him to decide whether to accept the recommendation to transfer to category D conditions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG rejected ORG recommendation that the applicant should be transferred to a category D prison . He directed that the applicant should be moved to a category C prison . The reasons for his decision were set out as follows in a memorandum of CARDINAL DATE :", "\u201c The Secretary of ORG has carefully considered all the papers which were prepared for your recent ORG review , including the reports from staff at both Full GPE and GPE , your own and your solicitor \u2019s representations and the recommendation of ORG . He is not prepared to accept ORG recommendation for your transfer to open conditions for the reasons set out below .", "The Secretary of ORG notes the recommendations made by ORG and by report writers , the majority of whom support a progressive move . He notes in particular , your willingness to co - operate with offence - related treatment work and the progress you have made as a result , your improved behaviour and the remorse you have shown . However , he is concerned by references to your tendency , on occasions , to be aggressive , unwilling or unable to consider fully the likely consequences of your actions or behaviour or see how others perceive your behaviour .", "In considering ORG recommendation for your transfer to open conditions , which is generally a time of final testing in more normal conditions as a prelude to release , the Secretary of ORG needs to be satisfied that you have made sufficient progress towards tackling your behavioural problems so as to minimise the risk of your reoffending , or risk to the public while in open conditions or when release takes place .", "The Secretary of ORG notes that you have not been tested in category C conditions . Life sentenced prisoners are normally required to spend a period in the lower security conditions of a category C prison to enable them to adjust to , and experience , a less secure environment before eventually progressing to open conditions . He considers this to be all the more important in your case in view of the very long period you have spent in maximum security conditions , much of which has been spent in segregation units , and notes that you are still held in category B conditions .", "He also considers that , although you have attended offending behaviour courses , and appear to have benefited from them , that work needs to be reinforced and tested in the lower security environment of category C conditions before consideration is given to your transfer to open conditions . In particular , further offence - related work needs to be tackled , together with continuing work to develop more mature , reflective styles of thinking and behaving and enhanced interpersonal skills .", "You will therefore be transferred to a suitable category C establishment . However , in the light of the positive reports from staff at both Full GPE and GPE , your next review will begin DATE thereafter . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , transfer instructions were issued for the applicant \u2019s transfer to ORG , a Category C prison . This was endorsed as a \" priority career move \" in view of the need for a review of the applicant \u2019s continued detention to commence DATE after transfer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant submitted a complaint / request form objecting to the transfer to ORG as inconvenient for social visits and stating his preferences for other category C prisons .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , it was decided to move the applicant to GPE ( category C ) and the applicant was informed that the other prisons which he had listed were either unsuitable or had long waiting lists . At this time no place at FAC was immediately available : he was fifth on the list .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was moved to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s application for judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision not to reclassify him from a category B to a category D prisoner was dismissed by ORG . This was on the basis that there had not been any procedural irregularity in the decision - making process . During the course of his judgment , Mr Justice PERSON said the following :", "\u201c It is clear that the decision which the Secretary of ORG had to make in this case was an important one . It was important because such a decision has a potential to affect the release date of a prisoner in that delay in transfer to category D has the potential to delay of release on parole . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON also made , inter alia , the following observations :", "( a ) there had not been any finding by the ORG that there would be a regression in the behaviour or the attitude of the applicant were he to be placed in a category C prison ;", "( b ) the ORG had taken \u201c an unusual course \u201d in recommending that the applicant should be transferred from a category B to a category D prison , as , ordinarily , a life prisoner would pass through the categories from which he had started , therefore going through category C into category D ;", "( c ) counsel for the applicant had not suggested that the decision of the Secretary of ORG not to accede to the recommendation of the ORG was open to attack other than on procedural grounds .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not seek leave to appeal and was advised that he did not have any right of appeal against the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s subsequent review by the ORG took place at an oral hearing on DATE , over DATE after his arrival in category C conditions and over DATE after his previous review in DATE . On that occasion , the ORG decided not to direct his release , but recommended that he should be transferred to open conditions . Its decision letter to the applicant of CARDINAL DATE stated , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Until your arrival at FAC you had been in conditions of greater security . During your year at ORG the panel accepts that you have continued to make progress and your behaviour has been good . You have done all that has been required by your sentence plan and you have made sufficient progress towards tackling your offending behaviour to justify your move to open conditions . So far as risk is concerned , however , you have experienced testing only in closed conditions .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to your serious offending , your behaviour in prison DATE and the fact that you have never been tested in open conditions , the panel considers that your risk is not as yet sufficiently reduced to justify your immediate release .", "CARDINAL . NORP ... Most report writers recommended you for open conditions but not for release . Until you have been tested in open conditions the panel can not be satisfied that your risk is sufficiently reduced for your release .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore your release plan was not realistic or reasonable ...", "CARDINAL . Your move to open conditions is needed primarily to test further your motivation to remain of good behaviour and your ability to cope with stress and frustration and to enable you to be gradually reintroduced to life in the community outside prison . ... In view of the fact that in DATE you were recommended as suitable for release and your progress since then , the panel recommended that you should move to open conditions at the earliest opportunity . Although several report writers recommended a review after DATE from your arrival in open conditions the panel considered that this period was probably insufficient to enable you to complete the testing which you need and therefore made no recommendation for an early review . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The recommendation that the applicant be moved to open conditions was accepted by the Secretary of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the applicant \u2019s subsequent review on DATE , the ORG was satisfied that it was no longer necessary for the protection of public that he be detained and therefore directed his release from prison .", "CARDINAL . A person convicted of certain serious offences may be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge . At the time of sentence , a \u201c tariff \u201d is imposed which represents the minimum period which the prisoner will have to serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence . A life prisoner will not be released on licence until after the tariff period has been completed .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG , after the tariff has expired , a discretionary life prisoner may require the Secretary of ORG to refer his case to ORG which has the power to order his release if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary to detain him for the protection of the public .", "CARDINAL . ORG further has power , should it choose not to direct the release of a prisoner , to make recommendations to the Secretary of ORG concerning the detained person \u2019s future progress .", "CARDINAL . Following a review , a discretionary life prisoner has a statutory right to have his case reviewed again by ORG DATE after the previous review .", "CARDINAL . If ORG decides not to order release , it frequently gives a recommendation as to the timing of the next review . That is only a recommendation and the decision whether to accept that recommendation is taken by the Secretary of ORG . If the prisoner seeks an earlier review , he can make representations to the Secretary of ORG , whose decision may be challenged by judicial review . The Secretary of ORG , of his own motion , can direct an earlier review .", "CARDINAL . The categorisation of prisoners is the function of the Secretary of ORG . There are CARDINAL categories of classification of prisoners , namely :", "( i ) category A prisoners , whose escape would be highly dangerous to the public or to the police or to the security of the nation ;", "( ii ) category B prisoners , for whom the very highest conditions of security are not necessary but for whom escape must be made very difficult ;", "( iii ) category C prisoners , who can not be trusted in open conditions , but who do not have the ability or the resources to make a determined escape attempt ;", "( iv ) category D prisoners , who can be trusted in open conditions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG stated :", "\u201c In DATE , successive Secretaries of ORG have recognised that , for the majority of life sentenced prisoners , a period in open prison conditions is generally vital in terms of testing the prisoner \u2019s suitability for release and in preparing him for a successful return to the community . It is , therefore , now normally the practice to require the prisoner to spend some time in open conditions before release and to arrange a further review while the prisoner is in an open prison for a formal assessment of his or her progress . I intend to continue with this practice and the first ORG review will therefore normally serve the purpose of assessing the prisoner for open conditions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG stated :", "\u201c ... the first ORG review in the case of a life sentenced prisoner begins DATE before the expiry of tariff . The purpose of this review is normally to enable the prisoner to be assessed for , and , where appropriate , transferred to , open conditions ( category D ) where he or she may be tested in conditions of lower security , fully assessed by staff and prepared for release . A further ORG review is then held to determine whether the level of risk is low enough to enable the prisoner to be safely released on life licence . Where the level of risk is considered to be acceptable , the objective is to release the prisoner on or very shortly after tariff expiry . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A direction to ORG from the Secretary of ORG under section CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( which preceded ORG ) stated :", "\u201c A period in open conditions is essential for most life sentence prisoners ( \u201c lifers \u201d ) . It allows the testing of areas of concern in conditions which are nearer to those in the community than can be found in closed prisons . Lifers have the opportunity to take home leave from open prisons and , more generally , open conditions require them to take more responsibility for their actions . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
