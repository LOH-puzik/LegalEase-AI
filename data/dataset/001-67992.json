The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant bought a car from a Mr I.G.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the car was impounded by the police who explained to the applicant that it had been stolen . On DATE the applicant requested the return of the car but received no reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a criminal investigation was opened by ORG against a Mr N.P. for forgery of customs ' declarations for the importation of cars , one of which was the applicant 's . The prosecutor in charge of the case ordered that the car be held as a piece of evidence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the applicant CARDINAL times requested from the prosecution authorities the return of his car , but received no reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the car was handed over to ORG by order of ORG . On DATE the head of ORG made a penal order whereby he confiscated the car on the ground that it had been illegally imported into the country .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the penal order to ORG . In a judgment of DATE that court quashed the order and on DATE the car was returned to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action for damages against ORG and ORG , complaining that the impounding of his car and the unlawful order for its confiscation had prevented him from using it during DATE .", "CARDINAL . Noting that the applicant had failed to adduce written evidence in support of his allegations , ORG instructed him to do so within DATE . The applicant complied with these instructions and the court set the case down for hearing .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing took place on DATE . The court noted the absence of a representative of CARDINAL of the defendants , ORG , and ordered that it be summoned for the next hearing . The applicant 's lawyer requested the court to subpoena as a witness the prosecutor who had ordered the car to be handed over to ORG . The court rejected the request by an order of CARDINAL DATE , holding that the prosecutor 's actions could be proved through the official documents he had made and that his testimony would therefore be superfluous .", "CARDINAL . The second hearing was held on DATE . No representative of ORG appeared but a prosecutor was present in his capacity of \u201c special party \u201d to the proceedings . The \u201c special party \u201d prosecutor requested that the proceedings be stayed in order to take into account the pending criminal investigation against PERSON , as it related to the same car . In particular , there was information that the number on the engine and on the chassis of the car had been forged and that it had been illegally imported . The applicant 's lawyer agreed and requested that the actions against ORG and against ORG be severed . The court refused to sever the actions and acceded to the request for staying the proceedings , finding that there existed criminal elements the determination of which was decisive for the outcome of the civil dispute before it , within the meaning of LAW ( d ) of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the order for staying the proceedings to ORG . He argued that the outcome of the criminal investigation had nothing to do with the civil proceedings . Moreover , there were no criminal elements whose determination was decisive for the outcome of the civil dispute , as the prosecution authorities had transmitted the car to the customs authorities , thus excluding it from the evidence in the criminal investigation . The appeal was filed with ORG . Noting that the applicant had not paid the requisite fee , ORG refused to proceed with the appeal , instructing the applicant to pay the fee . The applicant did so and on DATE , after ORG had filed its answer , ORG forwarded the appeal to ORG . In a final order of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , confirming the lower court 's holding that there existed criminal elements whose determination was decisive for the outcome of the civil dispute , within the meaning of LAW ( d ) of the ORG . In particular , the car bought by the applicant had been impounded as a piece of evidence . The fact that later it had later been delivered to the customs authorities did not change that . Nor was it significant that the criminal proceedings were against CARDINAL party and that the penal order against the applicant had been quashed , because the applicant could still suffer the negative consequences of the criminal proceedings , e.g. the forfeiture of the car .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer requested ORG to resume the proceedings . In view of the request , on DATE the court sent a letter to ORG , asking whether the criminal investigation against PERSON ORG had been completed .

Following a further inquiry by the court , ORG notified it by a letter of CARDINAL DATE that the case had been sent to ORG on DATE . Taking into consideration that the investigation was still pending , by an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to resume the proceedings . It seems that there was no activity during the period between CARDINAL in the criminal investigation against Mr N.P.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings against Mr N.P.", "CARDINAL . ORG then resumed the proceedings and held a hearing on DATE . The applicant requested a change in the names of the defendants , as during the time when the proceedings had been stayed ORG had been renamed ORG and ORG had become ORG at ORG . The applicant also increased the amount of his claim for damages and requested leave to call one witness . The defendant ORG requested the court to include the case - file of the investigation against PERSON in the record . The court acceded to all of the parties ' requests and adjourned the case .", "CARDINAL . Three hearings listed for CARDINAL and CARDINAL May and DATE did not take place because ORG had not been duly summoned .", "CARDINAL .
