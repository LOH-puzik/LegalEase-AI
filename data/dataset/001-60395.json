LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-3-d;Violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , while completing their sentences in FAC , were suspected of participating in a riot that took place in the prison on DATE . CARDINAL detainees , including the applicants , were accused of causing or taking part in the riot .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant was released from prison after completing his original sentence on DATE . He was arrested on DATE in the context of the proceedings for riot . The first and the second applicants were still completing their original sentences throughout these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . During the pre - trial investigation CARDINAL witnesses were examined on behalf of the third applicant . During the trial one witness was called by ORG on the third applicant \u2019s behalf . The first and second applicants called no witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted all the defendants in the case , including the applicants . The court found that the first and the second applicants had organised the riot and that they had also committed affray . They were sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The third applicant was found guilty of having actively taken part in the riot and sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In establishing the first applicant \u2019s guilt , the court referred to the statements of CARDINAL anonymous witnesses who were mostly other detainees . These statements had been recorded by the prosecution during the pre - trial investigation . The secret witnesses testified that the first applicant had organised the riot . The court further referred to the statements at the pre - trial investigation of CARDINAL co - accused , J , S and T , confirming the first applicant \u2019s guilt . ORG noted that J , S and T had subsequently changed their testimony , alleging inter alia that prosecutors had forced them to inculpate the first applicant . However , the court considered that the initial statements of GPE and T had been valid , and that they had only changed their evidence upon intimidation by the other defendants . The court also took account of the statements given during the trial by a complainant , a detainee belonging to \u201c a lower caste among prisoners \u201d . The latter had testified that the first applicant had assaulted him on DATE . The court further noted the evidence given at the trial by CARDINAL members of the prison staff , alleging that the first applicant had organised the riot . ORG found that on DATE of the riot the first applicant had been under the influence of alcohol . In concluding that the first applicant was guilty of riot and affray , the court also mentioned indirect evidence : on - site inspection records , material evidence and expert examinations .", "CARDINAL . In finding the second applicant guilty , ORG referred to the statements by CARDINAL anonymous witnesses recorded by the prosecution during the pre - trial investigation . The anonymous statements testified that the second applicant had also been an organiser of the riot . As was the case with the first applicant , the court rejected the later statements of GPE and T , finding that their original testimonies given during the pre - trial investigation had constituted sufficient grounds for establishing the second applicant \u2019s guilt . The court also took account of the statements delivered at the trial by CARDINAL complainants who were detainees belonging to \u201c a lower caste among prisoners \u201d . The latter had alleged that on DATE the second applicant had beaten other detainees , attacked members of the prison staff and barricaded the prison . Evidence along the same lines was given by CARDINAL members of the prison staff summoned during the trial . ORG found that during the riot the second applicant had been under the influence of alcohol . The court also noted that the second applicant \u2019s guilt in committing riot and affray was indirectly proved by on - site inspection records , material evidence and expert examinations .", "CARDINAL . As to the grounds for the third applicant \u2019s guilt , ORG referred solely to the statements by CARDINAL anonymous witnesses recorded by the prosecution during the pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the first and the second applicants had been the apparent organisers of the riot of DATE , that they had been drunk , and that they had \u201c induced detainees of lower castes to get involved in the offence \u201d . The court also ruled that \u201c the level of participation in the crime by [ the third applicant ] had been lower \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed , stating that they had not committed the offences alleged , that the statements of anonymous witnesses had been invalid , that the secret evidence had not been scrutinised either by the defendants or the court , and that ORG had ignored certain evidence given during the pre - trial investigation by other detainees . In their opinion , CARDINAL inmates had taken part in the events of CARDINAL DATE . The applicants stated they had been victimised by the prison administration who had encouraged anonymous testimonies by other detainees , promising them favourable treatment . Furthermore , the \u201c secret witnesses \u201d had themselves allegedly taken part in the riot and had collaborated with the authorities in order to avoid prosecution . The prosecution also appealed against the first instance judgment , requesting more severe sentences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeals , finding that ORG had properly established the ORG guilt and imposed the correct sentences . It held that domestic criminal procedure permitted the first instance court to take account of evidence given by secret witnesses at the stage of pre - trial investigation , without summoning those witnesses to the trial .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a cassation appeal with ORG , complaining inter alia that the lower courts had not clarified the alleged controversy over the anonymous testimonies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeals , finding that the lower courts had properly decided the case . It noted that the first and the second applicants had been convicted not only on the basis of the anonymous testimonies , but also by reference to the statements of the complainants and the prison staff . ORG found that the third applicant had basically been convicted by reference to the statements of anonymous witnesses . However , in the view of the cassation court , those statements had been consistent and supplementary to other evidence confirming his guilt . No procedural irregularities were found in connection with the ORG refusal to examine the anonymous witnesses .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , in cases pertaining to serious offences a prosecutor or investigator is entitled to keep the identity of a witness secret with a view to ensuring that person \u2019s safety . Under paragraph CARDINAL of this LAW , at the stage of pre - trial investigation no one is entitled to have access to the personal details of the anonymous witness except the prosecutor or the investigator . Paragraph CARDINAL provides that any data on the anonymous witness are a ORG secret . Only prosecutors , investigators and judges are entitled to have access to the personal details of that person .", "Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code provides that the identity of an anonymous witness is classified under a code name . The data on the witness are kept in a special investigative record , which is separate from the case - file .", "Pursuant to LAW , where the identity of a witness is secret , a court may dispense with hearing that person by reading out the anonymous statement at a trial hearing . LAW and CARDINAL provide a possibility for the court , of its own motion , to question the anonymous witness in the absence of the parties . Paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW states that the court may also question the witness in the parties\u2019 presence at a non - public hearing . In such a case , the court must create acoustic and visual obstacles to prevent the parties from establishing the identity of the secret witness .", "Article CARDINAL of the PERSON provides that a defendant at the trial has equal rights to adduce and contest evidence , and that the trial is conducted by way of an adversarial procedure . LAW that the defendant has the right to take part in the examination of all evidence , and to question witnesses , experts and other persons in order to state his case at the trial , let alone in cases provided for in LAW .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( PERSON ) guarantees the right to a fair trial and lists specific defence rights .", "On DATE ORG held that ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , to the extent that they did not guarantee the right of the defendant to question anonymous witnesses while preserving the secrecy of their identity , unjustifiably limited the defendant \u2019s defence rights in breach of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
