THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 5-4;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility in respect of the death of his DATE landlady whom he had battered with an axe . He was sentenced to life imprisonment . The court acted on medical evidence that the applicant had a gross personality disorder to such a degree that he was amoral . The consultant psychiatrist said in his report at the trial that :", "\u201c ... although [ the applicant \u2019s ] instability might get DATE as he matured , should he be sent to prison , his eventual release should be approached with great caution . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was initially sent to a Category A prison due to concerns about his dangerousness and risk of escape . He was involved in work to address his offending and other problems . He successfully completed an ORG in ORG in or DATE and his conduct was noted as significantly improving from that point . In DATE , he was transferred to a Category B prison .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s tariff period of DATE expired on DATE ( this was the minimum period fixed by the Secretary of ORG concerning the requirements of retribution and deterrence ) . ORG in DATE agreed to the transfer of the applicant from a Category B to Category C prison . The Secretary of ORG deferred a decision until after the Discretionary Lifer Panel ( DLP ) of ORG had conducted a hearing on the matter under the new provisions of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after a hearing held pursuant to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , the ORG decided it would not be safe to release the applicant but recommended transfer to Category D ( open prison ) , or Category C with a review after DATE instead of the usual DATE . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG decided to transfer the applicant to Category C with a review after DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the applicant failed to obtain leave to apply for judicial review of the decision of the ORG and the decision of the Secretary of ORG . In DATE , ORG refused leave to apply for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . Following a positive drugs test , the applicant agreed to follow and successfully completed in DATE a drugs awareness course .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s case came before another ORG . Reports noted that he had made considerable progress over DATE but would need phased re - introduction into society . A psychiatric report dated DATE stated that the applicant had much greater control over his behaviour , that personal and maturational developments had taken place and that he was not the same person that he was when he entered prison . It was concluded that the applicant , who had shown a reclusiveness and narrowness of interests , needed however to test and increase his social interaction in order to be able to cope with living outside prison . A psychiatric report issued about the same time stated that the applicant \u2019s personality , described as psychopathic , had shown some capacity for change and that , although he was not considered a serious risk to the public , any release on licence would have to be carefully planned , as problems were likely to arise following a long period of institutionalisation and a lack of family support . The ORG did not recommend release but transfer to a Category D prison . In paragraph CARDINAL of the decision letter the ORG said :", "\u201c The panel were satisfied that what was advanced at the hearing as \u2018 exceptional ORG , namely a good release plan , the fact that [ the applicant is ] DATE beyond tariff , the fact that [ the applicant has ] completed a pre - release course in GPE , the fact that [ the applicant had ] previously been recommended for Category D status and the prospect of employment , did not amount to exceptional circumstances and that [ the applicant \u2019s ] release without progress through open conditions posed an unacceptable risk . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG rejected the recommendation of transfer to an open prison , but directed an early review of the applicant \u2019s case , namely after DATE had expired from DATE . The Secretary of ORG was not persuaded that the applicant \u2019s behavioural problems had been satisfactorily addressed while in closed conditions , nor that the benefits of open conditions were sufficiently worthwhile at that stage when balanced against the scale of the outstanding offence , related work needed in the applicant \u2019s case and his potential risk to the public .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for leave to apply for judicial review of both decisions , alleging inter alia that the ORG had wrongly applied an \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d test . Leave was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant re - applied for leave for judicial review . Mr Justice PERSON refused leave against the ORG \u2019s recommendation . He found that the ORG had correctly applied the statutory test concerning a risk to the public . He granted leave to apply in respect of the decision of the Secretary of ORG . Mr Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c ... a prisoner who has spent TIME in custody should be tested in open conditions before being released into the community : satisfactory completion of such testing is an indication that a prisoner is able to cope with the stresses of life outside prison and is therefore a cogent factor to take into account against all the other available material in deciding whether or not a prisoner can safely be released . Such an approach is undoubtedly sensible \u2026", "I think it is arguable that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision not to recategorise this applicant as a Category D prisoner was irrational and one that no reasonable Home Secretary could reasonably have reached . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the light of this grant of leave , at the end of the hearing , the Secretary of ORG indicated that he would reconsider his decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG informed the applicant that he had reconsidered the case but decided not to change his conclusion that the applicant should not be transferred to open conditions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG again considered the applicant \u2019s case . Reports continued to note his progress , including the expression of genuine remorse for his offending . It was considered in a case officer report dated DATE that he had taken advantage of treatment programmes and that all offending work had been completed . He had a \u201c settled and fulfilling release plan \u201d which involved him continuing the legal studies that he had commenced in prison and receiving support from a circle of friends that he had built up through contacts outside prison . Conversely , a psychiatric report dated DATE considered inter alia that the applicant might benefit from further work on developing methods of dealing with interpersonal difficulties and increasing relationship skills .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE , the ORG declined to recommend release but did recommend transfer to a Category D ( open ) prison .", "\u201c CARDINAL . In reaching the decision that you are not yet suitable for release , the panel took into account the nature of the index offence , your violent disruptive early prison career ( while recognising also the absence of any violence since DATE ) , the fact that you are still seen as having a psychopathic personality \u2026 and the remaining areas of concern identified by [ PERSON , a higher psychologist ] \u2026 These areas of concern are egocentricity , a disregard for the points of view of other people and a limited ability to solve interpersonal frustrations and problems . The panel also considered that the sexual ambivalence referred to by [ Dr G ] merited further investigation , particularly in light of evidence that emerged at the panel hearing that you had been sexually abused in your youth . The panel also accepted [ PERSON ] evidence that a personality assessment was necessary to identify the manner in which the outstanding offence - related work should be carried out ; and that the reasons underlying the index offence still require further investigation . In all these circumstances , the panel considered that you still presented too great a risk to the public to justify your release .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , you have been in custody for DATE and although your release plan is being developed , it is not complete . At present you would have no fixed accommodation . Based on these factors and the impression the panel formed of you at the hearing , the panel considered that you would be unable to cope in the community , were you to be released directly or via a pre - release employment scheme .", "CARDINAL . NORP The panel did recommend that you be transferred to open conditions . In coming to this conclusion , the panel took into account the length of time you have spent in custody , the opinion of the majority of the report writers and witnesses that the risk you present to the public could be safely managed in open conditions and the fact that the assessment and further work referred to above can be done in open conditions . The panel also took into account that [ Mrs B ] could not say within what period the assessment could be carried out , and the danger of counter - productive stagnation and frustration on your part should you have to spend a further protracted period in category \u2018 C\u2019 conditions .", "CARDINAL . To allow time for assessment and the necessary offence - related work and for your gradual reintegration into the community , the panel considered that your next review should begin in DATE time . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE , the Secretary of ORG rejected the ORG \u2019s recommendation . He stated that he accepted the psychologist \u2019s view that further work needed to be done in respect of the applicant \u2019s attitude to his original offence , his egocentricity , his intolerance of others , his inability to deal adequately with problems and his lack of responsibility for his actions . He agreed that a full personality assessment was required of the applicant who was still seen as having a psychopathic personality . The Secretary of ORG did not agree that these matters could be safely addressed in open prison conditions . He noted that the applicant had failed to attend further courses in anger management , social skills and communications , as arranged after the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision of DATE . He also had regard to an intervening incident which had occurred on DATE when the applicant was being escorted to court by a female officer . After she had refused to allow him to smoke in the vehicle , he had slammed the van door against her , causing her to fall and hurt her arm . He had sworn at her , threatening to kill her , adding that he had already killed CARDINAL woman . The applicant was found guilty under LAW of assault and using threatening , abusive or insulting words . The Secretary of ORG considered that this disclosed impulsive violent behaviour towards a woman over a trivial incident , which had clear similarities with his original offence . He remained an unacceptable risk and was advised that until he co - operated with staff in addressing the areas of concern , the Secretary of ORG saw no justification in allowing him to progress further towards release . It was however agreed that his next review should take place in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s renewed application for leave to judicially review the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE , which had been dormant since DATE , was listed for hearing before ORG . The applicant \u2019s request to amend his grounds of application to add complaints about a lack of independence was refused . ORG rejected his application for leave to apply for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . Persons sentenced to mandatory and discretionary life imprisonment , custody for life and those detained during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure have a \u2018 LOC set in relation to the period of imprisonment they should serve in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence . After the expiry of the tariff , the prisoner becomes eligible for release on licence . Applicable provisions and practice in respect of the fixing of the tariff and release on licence have been subject to change , most notably , following the coming into force on DATE of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which was in force at the relevant time . The provisions of the DATE Act were replaced by ORG \u201c the DATE LAW ) from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section DATE ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act , ORG had a duty to advise the Secretary of ORG with respect to any matter referred to it by him which was connected with the early release or recall of prisoners .", "CARDINAL . ORG Chairman appointed CARDINAL members of ORG to consider discretionary life cases . They comprised the ORG . Pursuant to ORG DATE which came into force on DATE , a discretionary life prisoner was entitled to , amongst other things , an oral hearing , disclosure of evidence before ORG and legal representation . He was also entitled to call witnesses on his behalf and to cross - examine those who had written reports about him . A reasoned decision by the ORG was delivered within DATE of the hearing . Prior to DATE , the duty to release discretionary life prisoners was dealt with by LAW , which provided that where a discretionary life prisoner had served his tariff and ORG had directed his release , it was the duty of the Secretary of ORG to release him on licence .", "CARDINAL .

When deciding on release or recall of prisoners , the ORG often gave guidance as to the timing of the next review . It normally recommended a further review in DATE but an earlier date could be given in an appropriate case , with reasons .

Where it became clear that the prisoner had made unexpectedly rapid progress prior to the set review date , the date of the review could be brought forward .", "CARDINAL .
