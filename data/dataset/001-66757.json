On DATE the applicant was at the day - care centre when he became particularly agitated , hitting himself on the head with his fists and banging his head against the wall . Staff could not contact Mr and PERSON and got in touch with a local doctor , who administered a sedative . The applicant remained agitated and , on the recommendation of the local authority care services manager ( PERSON ) with overall responsibility for the applicant , he was taken to the accident and emergency unit at the hospital .", "CARDINAL . At the hospital , the applicant remained agitated and anxious and was received and assessed by PERSON ( acting consultant psychiatrist \u2013 learning disabilities services ) as being in need of in - patient treatment . He was transferred , with the physical support of CARDINAL nursing assistants , to the hospital \u2019s IBU . He was recorded as making no attempt to leave .

The applicant was to be referred to the psychology and speech therapist for assessment and a care plan was to be drawn up as appropriate \u201c for maintenance purposes on discharge \u201d .

On DATE Dr M. prepared a detailed report on the applicant \u2019s history , care and progress for the manager ( learning disabilities ) of the local health authority as a follow - up to their recent discussions regarding the applicant .

Legal aid was granted to instruct an independent psychiatrist to prepare a report . The psychiatric report , dated DATE , was prepared jointly by a consultant psychiatrist and a registrar in the psychiatry of learning disability , both attached to ORG at ORG .

Dr PERSON pointed out that the applicant was not clinically fit for discharge .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since Mr and PERSON had expressed concerns to staff at the hospital about the applicant \u2019s care and treatment , PERSON sent a long letter to PERSON and PERSON on DATE in which she explained the clinical team \u2019s responsibility to provide the applicant with the care and clinical input he required . In particular , PERSON noted :", "\u201c I would like to take the opportunity to stress , through this correspondence , that we , as a Clinical Team , within the [ IBU ] , are here , primarily to provide the treatment for [ the applicant ] who was admitted under our care , as an emergency . It would be extremely irresponsible of us not to provide [ the applicant ] with the care and the clinical input that he deserves and is in need of . His disposal / discharge from within the unit is dependent ... on the Multidisciplinary Clinical Professionals\u2019 considered views , following their assessment and the work that they intend doing with [ the applicant ] , specifically , in relation to his challenging behaviour and/or mental health needs . As I have stressed , in my earlier correspondence , these things do take time and unfortunately we have to be a little patient to allow the professionals some room and space to carry on with their work in the provision of care ... [ The applicant ] has been admitted to the [ IBU ] on an \u2018 informal\u2019 basis and this is not a time - limited admission . I am not sure if you have misunderstood his status and are under the impression that perhaps he was admitted and held under \u2018 the Mental Health Act\u2019 . Even then , there is no \u2018 one ORG time - limit , as it all depends on the patient \u2019s fitness for discharge ... On behalf of ORG , I would like to stress that [ the applicant ] is being treated within the [ IBU ] and once he is fit for discharge , he will be discharged back to the address from where he was admitted , with a \u2018 Treatment Plan\u2019 which will include all aspects of his care and a \u2018 maintenance ORG prescribed . \u201d", "Given the ongoing treatment and assessments , it was not possible to specify a discharge date . PERSON repeated her offer to meet PERSON and PERSON to discuss the applicant \u2019s care .", "CARDINAL . In a further letter of DATE , PERSON confirmed to PERSON and PERSON that the conclusions drawn from the assessments to date meant , and the recent clinical professionals\u2019 meeting had decided , that the applicant was to be \u201c fully \u201d referred for care and treatment to the ORG and that his stay was likely to be a long one . She invited PERSON and PERSON to attend a clinical meeting about the applicant \u2019s care and treatment on DATE and offered to meet PERSON and PERSON separately to discuss , inter alia , the subject of visits .", "CARDINAL . Mr and PERSON in a letter of DATE that they could not agree with the suggested plan for the applicant and would be in touch again prior to the relevant meeting . By a letter dated DATE , PERSON and PERSON confirmed that they would not be able to attend the meeting on DATE as they were seeking legal advice . PERSON responded by letter dated DATE expressing regret that PERSON and PERSON felt that their attendance at the clinical meeting could jeopardise the applicant \u2019s position . In a separate letter of DATE , PERSON outlined the results of the clinical meeting , including a recommendation that PERSON and PERSON E. visit the applicant once a week , and requested them to contact her to arrange this .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr M. reassured Mr and PERSON that the subject of them visiting the applicant had been discussed at the hospital at some length and encouraged PERSON and PERSON to meet her to discuss the applicant \u2019s needs .", "CARDINAL . Detailed behaviour management guidelines were issued on DATE by the psychology service of the hospital to , among others , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , the applicant \u2019s social worker and other therapeutic services that were to be involved in the applicant \u2019s future care . Appendix DATE was a detailed clinical description of the applicant \u2019s mental state ( autism and a cyclical mood disorder ) , needs and reactions prepared on the basis of extensive psychiatric and behavioural observations and assessments , with a view to achieving a global approach to his condition , treatment and care . Appendix CARDINAL contained an extremely detailed \u201c communication dictionary \u201d which was designed to enhance communication with the applicant through voice , action and routine . Appendix CARDINAL contained recording charts .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE to the applicant \u2019s legal representatives , PERSON acknowledged receipt of the guidelines of DATE ( described above ) and explained the clinical team \u2019s plans regarding the applicant \u2019s release on leave of absence in the near future with a view to a possible full discharge at DATE .", "CARDINAL . In or around DATE , the applicant , represented by his cousin and \u201c next friend \u201d , applied for leave to apply for judicial review of the hospital \u2019s decision to admit him on DATE , for a writ of habeas corpus and for damages for false imprisonment and assault ( a technical assault associated with his admission ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused the application . It found that , although the DATE Act provided a comprehensive statutory regime for those formally admitted to psychiatric care , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act preserved the common - law jurisdiction in respect of informal patients . Since the applicant had not been \u201c detained \u201d but had been informally admitted and since the requirements of the common - law principle of necessity had been satisfied , his application was rejected .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , Master of the Rolls , delivered the principal judgment . On the question of whether the applicant was \u201c detained \u201d , he noted that it was agreed that this was a question of objective fact which did not depend on the presence or absence of consent or knowledge . He considered that a person was detained in law if those who had control over the LOC in which he was situated intended that he should not be permitted to leave and had the ability to prevent him doing so . He went on :", "\u201c We do not consider that the [ High Court ] judge was correct to conclude that [ the applicant ] was \u2018 free to ORG . We think it is plain that , had he attempted to leave the hospital , those in charge of him would not have permitted him to do so . ... PERSON and PERSON had looked after [ the applicant ] , as one of the family , for DATE . They had made it plain that they wanted to take him back into their care . It is clear that the hospital was not prepared to countenance this . If they were not prepared to release [ the applicant ] into the custody of his carers , they were not prepared to let him leave the hospital at all . He was and is detained there . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON also found that the right to detain a patient for treatment for mental disorder was to be found only in LAW , the provisions of which applied to the exclusion of the common - law principle of necessity . Section CARDINAL which preserved the right to admit a patient informally applied only to a patient who had the capacity to and did consent to his admission . Since the applicant had been admitted for treatment without his consent and the other formalities required by LAW , his detention was unlawful :", "\u201c It follows from our judgment that the whole approach of the [ hospital ] in this case was based on a false premise . It was based on the belief that they were entitled to treat [ the applicant ] as an in - patient without his consent as long as he did not dissent . That was a wrong approach . They were only allowed to admit him for treatment if they complied with the statutory requirements . ... [ W]here [ LAW ] covers the situation , no necessity to act outside the statute can arise . The [ hospital \u2019s ] powers to act under the common - law doctrine of necessity can arise only in relation to situations not catered for by [ LAW ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG awarded nominal damages and granted leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG granted leave to , among others , ORG to intervene in the proceedings . In its submissions to ORG , the ORG outlined the beneficial consequences to patients of ORG conclusion that persons in the applicant \u2019s position were \u201c detained \u201d for the purposes of LAW , which included the application to such persons of the substantive and procedural safeguards of the LAW . The ORG also described the survey it had completed since ORG judgment by sending a questionnaire to all ORG hospitals ( and registered nursing homes ) . PERCENT of those establishments responded , from which the Commission was able to submit that , if ORG judgment were applied to patients such as the applicant , there would be CARDINAL detained patients resident on any one day and CARDINAL compulsory admissions per year under LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE and unanimously allowed the appeal . PERSON ( with whom ORG and ORG agreed ) delivered the principal judgment . Lords PERSON and PERSON also agreed that the appeal should be allowed but for different reasons .", "CARDINAL . Having considered the drafting history of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , Lord PERSON disagreed with ORG and concluded that section CARDINAL applied to patients who consented as well as to compliant but incapacitated patients . He underlined , however , that the statutory history of the section , which put the matter beyond all doubt , appeared not to have been drawn to the attention of ORG and that ORG did not have the benefit , as did ORG , of assistance from counsel appearing for the Secretary of ORG . As to the basis upon which a hospital was entitled to treat , and to care for , patients who were admitted as informal patients under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) but lacked the capacity to consent to such treatment or care , PERSON stated as follows :", "\u201c It was plainly the statutory intention that such patients would indeed be cared for , and receive such treatment for their condition as might be prescribed for them in their best interests . Moreover , the doctors in charge would , of course , owe a duty of care to such a patient in their care . Such treatment and care can , in my opinion , be justified on the basis of the common - law doctrine of necessity ... ( Re F. ( Mental Patient : Sterilisation ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL ) It is not therefore necessary to find such justification in the [ CARDINAL Act ] itself , which is silent on the subject . It might , I imagine , be possible to discover an implication in the statute providing similar justification ; but even assuming that to be right , it is difficult to imagine that any different result would flow from such a statutory implication . For present purposes , therefore , I think it appropriate to base justification for treatment and care of such patients on the common - law doctrine . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON then considered whether the applicant had been \u201c unlawfully detained \u201d as alleged and as found by ORG . He pointed out that for the tort of false imprisonment to be committed there must , in fact , be a complete deprivation of , or restraint on liberty : an actual and not a potential deprivation of liberty went towards constituting the tort . Lord PERSON then turned to the facts and quoted extensively from the affidavit ( sworn on DATE ) of PERSON", "\u201c At TIME on DATE I was contacted by ... [ the ] social worker and [ the applicant \u2019s ] case manager . She advised me that there had been an incident at ORG , where [ the applicant ] had been attending since DATE , when [ the applicant ] had seriously self - harmed and was extremely disturbed . She said that he had to be sent to ORG and she requested assistance from the psychiatric services to assess [ the applicant ] with a view to admitting him if necessary . CARDINAL of my team members , [ PERSON , staff grade psychiatrist , attended ORG as requested . His notes state that he took a history from ... the team manager at ORG who reported that since DATE [ the applicant \u2019s ] episodes of self - injurious behaviour had increased in severity . On DATE whilst he was at Cranstock he had been agitated , hyperventilating , pacing up and down and hitting himself on the head with his fists . He was also banging his head on the wall . The whole area had to be evacuated to avoid disturbance and assure the safety of others . He was given QUANTITY of ORG to try to calm him down at the time but this had no effect . The ORG was therefore called who administered QUANTITY of Zimovane . However he still remained agitated in ORG . He was assessed and treated at A & E. [ Dr P. ] later assessed [ the applicant ] as being agitated and very anxious . He noted redness of both his temples , that he was punching his head with both his fists at times and hyperventilating . [ Dr P. ] assessed that [ the applicant ] required in - patient treatment and transferred [ the applicant ] to ORG . [ PERSON noted that [ the applicant ] \u2018 makes no attempt to ORG . I recorded that we considered whether it was necessary to detain [ the applicant ] under LAW DATE but it was decided that this was not necessary as he was , as I noted at the time , \u2018 quite compliant\u2019 and had \u2018 not attempted to run NORP . He was therefore admitted as an informal patient . If [ the applicant ] had resisted admission I would certainly have detained him under the [ DATE ] Act as I was firmly of the view that he required in - patient treatment . This was clearly thought through and supported following discussion with [ PERSON , ward staff , other professionals and the ORG Manager . An appropriate framework of care and treatment was implemented . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON then noted how PERSON had then", "\u201c ... described how PERSON and PERSON were informed on DATE of [ the applicant \u2019s ] admission , as was [ the applicant \u2019s ] next of kin . At first , with the agreement of PERSON and PERSON , it was arranged that they would not visit [ the applicant ] for DATE , in accordance with the usual clinical practice . On DATE Dr M. wrote to PERSON and PERSON and in her letter invited them to come and meet her DATE when it was her intention to discuss the possibility of phased visits , but they did not accept this invitation to meet her . On DATE an advocacy worker was appointed as [ the applicant \u2019s ] advocate . [ The applicant ] was again assessed . A programme of tests and observations was then put into effect . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON continued to quote from PERSON affidavit :", "\u201c As [ the applicant ] is an informal patient there has never been any attempt to detain him against his will or carry out any tests , observations or assessments to which he indicated a dislike or with which he refused to cooperate . [ The applicant ] has always accepted his medication which has always been administered orally . He was also fully compliant when blood was taken from him for testing . He did not however cooperate with the attempts that were made to carry out a GPE scan and ORG , which were necessary in view of his old history of fits and temporal lobe abnormality , on CARDINAL and DATE and so these tests were abandoned . [ The applicant ] cooperated to a certain extent with the speech therapy assessment which was carried out on DATE and the occupational therapy assessment . However , as soon as he showed any signs of distress the assessments were postponed and reviewed . [ The applicant ] is accommodated on an unlocked ward and has never attempted to leave the hospital but has accepted the change in his environment very well and is not distressed by it ... It was , in my professional opinion , in [ the applicant \u2019s ] best interests to be admitted on DATE and it is also in his best interests to continue with in - patient treatment to prevent further deterioration of his mental health . His discharge at this point in time would therefore be against medical advice . At the time of and since admission [ the applicant ] has been fully compliant with treatment and never indicated that he wishes to leave the hospital . In view of this it has not been necessary to detain him under the Act ... If [ the applicant ] stopped cooperating or indicated a wish to leave then I would have to consider at that time whether his condition warranted detention under LAW . As these circumstances have not so far arisen detention has not been necessary . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON considered that , in the light of the above account by PERSON , the following conclusions might be drawn :", "\u201c The first is that , as I have already recorded , although [ the applicant ] had been discharged from hospital into the community on a trial basis , and on that basis had gone to live with PERSON and PERSON as his paid carers , nevertheless he had not been finally discharged . It followed that the appellant trust remained responsible for his treatment , and that it was in discharge of that responsibility that the steps described by PERSON were taken . The second is that when , on DATE , [ the applicant ] became agitated and acted violently , an emergency in any event arose which called for intervention , as a matter of necessity , in his best interests and , at least in the initial stages , to avoid danger to others . Plainly it was most appropriate that the appellant trust , and PERSON in particular , should intervene in these circumstances ; certainly PERSON and PERSON , as [ the applicant \u2019s ] carers , could not assert any superior position . Third , I have no doubt that all the steps in fact taken , as described by PERSON , were in fact taken in the best interests of [ the applicant ] and , in so far as they might otherwise have constituted an invasion of his civil rights , were justified on the basis of the common - law doctrine of necessity .", "I wish to add that the latter statement is as true of any restriction upon his freedom of movement as then occurred , as it is of any touching of his person . There were times during the episode when it might be said that [ the applicant ] was \u2018 ORG in the sense that , in the absence of justification , the tort of false imprisonment would have been committed . I have particularly in mind the journey by ambulance from LOC to ORG . But that journey was plainly justified by necessity , as must frequently be so in the case of removal to hospital by ambulance of unfortunate people who have been taken ill or suffered injury and as a result are incapacitated from expressing consent . I wish further to add that I can not see that Dr PERSON \u2019s statements to the effect that she would if necessary have taken steps compulsorily to detain [ the applicant ] under the Act of DATE have any impact on the above conclusions . Those concerned with the treatment and care of mentally disordered persons must always have this possibility in mind although , like PERSON , they will know that this power is only to be exercised in the last resort and they may hope , as in the present case , that it would prove to be unnecessary to exercise it . Such power , if exercised in accordance with the statute , is of course lawful . In the present case all the steps in fact taken by PERSON were , in my opinion , lawful because justified under the common - law doctrine of necessity , and this conclusion is unaffected by her realisation that she might have to invoke the statutory power of detention .", "Finally , the readmission of [ the applicant ] to hospital as an informal patient under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act of DATE could not , in my opinion , constitute the tort of false imprisonment . His readmission , as such , did not constitute a deprivation of his liberty . As PERSON stated in paragraph CARDINAL of her affidavit , he was not kept in a locked ward after he was admitted . And the fact that she , like any other doctor in a situation such as this , had it in her mind that she might thereafter take steps to detain him compulsorily under the LAW , did not give rise to his detention in fact at any earlier date . Furthermore , his treatment while in hospital was plainly justified on the basis of the common - law doctrine of necessity . It follows that none of these actions constituted any wrong against [ the applicant ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . For these reasons , Lord PERSON allowed the appeal . He had CARDINAL \u201c subsidiary points \u201d , the second one being as follows :", "\u201c ... the function of the common - law doctrine of necessity [ lies ] in justifying actions which might otherwise be tortious , and so has the effect of providing a defence to actions in tort . The importance of this was , I believe , first revealed in the judgments in ORG ( Mental Patient : Sterilisation ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL . I wish , however , to express my gratitude to counsel for the appellants ... for drawing to our attention CARDINAL earlier cases in which the doctrine was invoked , viz . PERSON v. PERSON ( DATE ) Lofft CARDINAL , especially at p. CARDINAL , per Lord GPE , PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL F. and F. CARDINAL , CARDINAL , per PERSON , and PERSON v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL F. and PERSON , CARDINAL , per PERSON , all of which provide authority for the proposition that the common law permitted the detention of those who were a danger , or potential danger , to themselves or others , in so far as this was shown to be necessary . I must confess that I was unaware of these authorities though , now that they have been drawn to my attention , I am not surprised that they should exist . The concept of necessity has its role to play in all branches of our law of obligations \u2013 in contract ( see the cases on agency of necessity ) , in tort ( see ORG ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL ) , and in restitution ( see the sections on necessity in the standard books on the subject ) DATE and in our criminal law . It is therefore a concept of great importance . It is perhaps surprising , however , that the significant role it has to play in the law of torts has come to be recognised at so late a stage in the development of our law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , for his part , agreed with ORG that the applicant had been detained : he referred to the contents of PERSON long letter of DATE and to the additional matters on which ORG had relied in this respect ( and quoted above ) . Nevertheless , he allowed the appeal as he was satisfied that", "\u201c the trust and its medical staff behaved throughout not only in what they judged to be the best interests of [ the applicant ] , but in strict accordance with their common - law duty of care and the common - law principle of necessity \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON also allowed the appeal . He recognised that to uphold the decision of ORG would be to ensure that a number of important protections applied to the applicant and that to allow the appeal would result in an indefensible gap in mental health law . However , he considered that it was possible , on a contextual interpretation of LAW , to allow the appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the first place , he found that the applicant had been detained :", "\u201c It is unnecessary to attempt a comprehensive definition of detention . In my view , this case falls on the wrong side of any reasonable line that can be drawn between what is or what is not imprisonment or detention . The critical facts are as follows : ( CARDINAL ) When on DATE at the Day Centre [ the applicant ] became agitated and started injuring himself , he was sedated and then physically supported and taken to the hospital . Even before sedation he was unable to express dissent to his removal to hospital . ( CARDINAL ) Health care professionals exercised effective power over him . If [ the applicant ] had physically resisted , the psychiatrist would immediately have taken steps to ensure his compulsory admission . ( CARDINAL ) In hospital staff regularly sedated him . That ensured that he remained tractable . This contrasts with the position when he was with carers : they seldom resorted to medication and then only in minimal doses . ( CARDINAL ) The psychiatrist vetoed visits by the carers to [ the applicant ] . She did so , as she explained to the carers , in order to ensure that [ the applicant ] did not try to leave with them . The psychiatrist told the carers that [ the applicant ] would be released only when she , and other health care professionals , deemed it appropriate . ( CARDINAL ) While [ the applicant ] was not in a locked ward , nurses closely monitored his reactions . Nurses were instructed to keep him under continuous observation and did so .", "Counsel for the Trust and the Secretary of ORG argued that [ the applicant ] was in truth always free not to go to the hospital and subsequently to leave the hospital . This argument stretches credulity to breaking point . The truth is that for entirely bona fide reasons , conceived in the best interests of [ the applicant ] , any possible resistance by him was overcome by sedation , by taking him to hospital and by close supervision of him in hospital . And if [ the applicant ] had shown any sign of wanting to leave , he would have been firmly discouraged by staff and , if necessary , physically prevented from doing so . The suggestion that [ the applicant ] was free to go is a fairy tale . ... In my view [ the applicant ] was detained because the health care professionals intentionally assumed control over him to such a degree as to amount to complete deprivation of his liberty \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , he found that detention to be justified under the common - law doctrine of necessity :", "\u201c It is now necessary to consider whether there was lawful authority to justify the detention and any treatment of [ the applicant ] . This is a matter of statutory construction . But it is important to approach the mental health legislation against the context of the principles of the common law . The starting - point of the common law is that when a person lacks capacity , for whatever reason , to take decisions about medical treatment , it is necessary for other persons , with appropriate qualifications , to take such decision for him : ORG ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL , at CARDINALH , per Lord PERSON of ORG . The principle of necessity may apply . For the purposes of the present case it has been assumed by all counsel that the requirements of the principle are simply that ( CARDINAL ) there must be \u2018 a necessity to act when it is not practicable to communicate with the assisted person\u2019 and ( CARDINAL ) \u2018 that the action taken must be such as a reasonable person would in all circumstances take , acting in the best interests of the assisted person\u2019 : Re F. , supra , per Lord PERSON of Chieveley , at CARDINALH. There was not unanimity on this point in Re F. But I am content to approach the matter in the same way as counsel did ... Against this common - law background ORG recommended a shift from the \u2018 ORG whereby hospital patients were \u2018 GPE by special procedures , to a situation in which most patients would be \u2018 informally\u2019 received in hospital , the term \u2018 informally\u2019 signifying \u2018 without any legal formality\u2019 . This was to be achieved by replacing the existing system \u2018 by the offer of care , without deprivation of liberty , to all who need it and are not unwilling to receive it\u2019 : see Report of ORG on ORG DATE ) ... The desired objective was to avoid stigmatising patients and to avoid where possible the adverse effects of \u2018 sectioning\u2019 patients . Where admission to hospital was required compulsion was to be regarded as a measure of last resort . LAW of DATE introduced the recommended changes . Section CARDINAL ) was the critical provision . ... Counsel appearing on behalf of [ the applicant ] accepted that the effect of section CARDINAL was to leave in place the common - law principle of necessity as a justification for informally receiving in hospital or mental nursing homes compliant incapacitated patients .", "In DATE ORG substantially amended LAW of DATE . In DATE ORG enacted a consolidating statute with amendments , namely LAW DATE . By section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act of DATE the provisions of section CARDINAL ) of the Act of DATE were re - enacted verbatim . ... Prima facie section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) must be given the same meaning as section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . On this basis , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) also preserved the common - law principle of necessity as a means of admitting compliant incapacitated individuals . But counsel for [ the applicant ] submitted that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , unlike its predecessor , only applies to consenting capacitated patients . He argued that contextual differences between the statutes of DATE and DATE required the court to interpret the language of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act of DATE in a narrower sense than section CARDINAL ) of the Act of DATE . ... On orthodox principles of statutory interpretation the conclusion can not be avoided that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) permits the admission of compliant incapacitated patients where the requirements of the principle of necessity are satisfied . Having had the benefit of the fuller argument produced by the intervention of the Secretary of ORG , I have to accept that the view of ORG on the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) can not be upheld . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the common - law doctrine of necessity had been preserved by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act and the applicant \u2019s detention and treatment were justified on that basis .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON went on to note that the effect of the House of Lords\u2019 judgment was to leave compliant incapacitated patients without the safeguards enshrined in the CARDINAL Act :", "\u201c This is an unfortunate result . The common - law principle of necessity is a useful concept , but it contains none of the safeguards of LAW . It places effective and unqualified control in the hands of the hospital psychiatrist and other health care professionals . It is , of course , true that such professionals owe a duty of care to patients and that they will almost invariably act in what they consider to be the best interests of the patient . But neither habeas corpus nor judicial review are sufficient safeguards against misjudgments and professional lapses in the case of compliant incapacitated patients . Given that such patients are diagnostically indistinguishable from compulsory patients , there is no reason to withhold the specific and effective protections of [ LAW ] from a large class of vulnerable mentally incapacitated individuals . Their moral right to be treated with dignity requires nothing less . The only comfort is that counsel for the Secretary of ORG has assured the ORG that reform of the law is under active consideration . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr and PERSON complained to the Commissioner about the applicant \u2019s readmission to hospital . The complaints subjected to investigation were : ( a ) that the clinical decision to admit the applicant on DATE was unreasonable ; and ( b ) that the clinical management of his admission was inadequate .

The process of assessment of the applicant had been too long and resources should have been available to speed up that process . In this latter respect , the assessors did not believe that any of the clinicians were acting irresponsibly or maliciously and their main recommendation for the future was that admissions to the IBU be \u201c strictly time - limited \u201d and that adequate resources be made available to enable a multi - disciplinary assessment to be carried out if at all possible on an outpatient basis and , if not , as speedily as possible .", "CARDINAL .

Doctors charged with the decisions about the future treatment of patients and whether such treatment would , in the cases of those lacking capacity to make their own decisions , be in their best interests , have to act at all times in accordance with a responsible and competent body of relevant professional opinion . That is the professional standard set for those who make such decisions . The doctor , acting to that required standard has , in my view , a second duty , that is to say he must act in the best interests of a mentally incapacitated patient .

In our DATE consultation papers , however , we suggested that certain principles of general application would always be relevant . At least in so far as substitute health - care decisions are concerned , the principles we suggested probably involve a significant departure from the present state of the law . This , as set out in [ ORG ( Mental Patient : Sterilisation ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL ] , appears to provide that a doctor who acts in accordance with an accepted body of medical opinion is both ( CARDINAL ) not negligent and ( CARDINAL ) acting in the best interests of a patient without capacity . \u201d", "The footnote at this point in the report ( and to which Lady Justice PERSON referred in R .- B.
