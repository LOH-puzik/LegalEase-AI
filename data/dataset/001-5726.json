The applicant submits that one of her opponents in the election campaign , who was eventually elected to the post of the mayor , frequently criticised her in the media as a \u201c cultist striving for power \u201d and referred to the ORG as a \u201c totalitarian sect \u201d .", "On DATE the newly elected mayor sent a letter to the President of ORG , requesting the applicant 's dismissal from the judiciary on the ground that she was a \u201c cultist \u201d . A number of private persons also applied to the court , complaining about the applicant 's performance of her judicial functions .", "On DATE ORG , a local association of judges , considered the question whether the applicant had misused her authority as a judge . The council instituted disciplinary proceedings against her , applying to ORG of ORG to decide the question of her dismissal from the judiciary .", "From DATE ORG held hearings in the case . The panel consisted of CARDINAL judges . Representatives of the council and a local authority were the applicant 's opposing parties vis - \u00e0 - vis the applicant . The panel heard the applicant and several witnesses , including officials of ORG and ORG , who testified against her . The panel scrutinised written statements of CARDINAL persons , including many private persons complaining about the way in which the applicant had handled their cases . The applicant asserts that she was refused to call several witnesses on her behalf .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant from the office and removed her \u201c third qualification grade \u201d of a judge on the ground that she had \u201c damaged her reputation as a judge and impaired the authority of the judiciary \u201d within the meaning of LAW . The panel also found that she had breached LAW , the Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations Act and LAW of a Judge . The panel ruled that she had misused her office to \u201c pursue religious activities in the interests of the ORG \u201d inter alia by recruiting as ORG members several officials of ORG and certain third persons , including parties to proceedings under her examination . It was also found that the applicant had unsuccessfully attempted to enrol a number of other persons , that she had prayed publicly during court hearings , and that she had promised certain parties to proceedings a favourable outcome of their cases if they joined the ORG . ORG noted that that had resulted in numerous challenges against the applicant , and that a number of cases had been delayed as a result .", "The panel further observed that the applicant was free to choose her religion and that the ORG was a legitimate organisation duly registered by the local authorities . The panel mentioned nonetheless that the ORG was a \u201c sect bearing with the label of a NORP church , [ but that ] it [ was ] not such in fact \u201d . ORG further confirmed that the applicant had been entitled to run in the election of the mayor ; it nonetheless criticised the applicant 's campaign as promoting her religion rather than emphasising \u201c current difficulties \u201d of the society and the economy of the ORG .", "The applicant appealed to ORG of GPE , claiming in particular that she had never misused her office in the interest of the ORG or promoted her religion by using her authority as a judge .", "On DATE ORG , consisting of CARDINAL judges , examined the appeal in the presence of the applicant and a representative of ORG of ORG , who requested that the appeal be dismissed .

The court ruled that the applicant had been involved in propaganda of the ORG and religious intimidation of parties to proceedings under her examination . ORG decided that the applicant therefore gave rise to doubts as to impartiality and independence of the court .", "The applicant states that the hearing before ORG was initially set to take place on DATE . As no notification of a change of that date was sent to her , she arrived on CARDINAL DATE , but found that the case had in fact been heard on DATE .", "The Government state that the hearing at ORG was scheduled for and took place on DATE", "The date of ORG hearing in ORG written judgment is indicated as DATE .", "The Government submit that the date of ORG hearing as being DATE was put by mistake in the judgment , which was eventually corrected .", "LAW and LAW provide that all judges have equal status .", "Pursuant to LAW , judges can be granted \u201c qualification grades \u201d on the basis of their judicial experience or other professional accomplishments .
