The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was visited by CARDINAL unfamiliar men , GPE and ORG , who offered to buy CARDINAL of the flat she lived in for MONEY ( ORG ) . It was a CARDINAL - bedroom flat , measuring QUANTITY , recently privatised and acquired in equal shares by the applicant and her adult son , Y. The applicant refused to sell CARDINAL of the flat . According to her , the price offered was extraordinarily below the market value . In any event , she had no reason to sell the flat , which had been her long - established home for DATE . In response , ORG and ORG warned the applicant that she would regret her decision , because DATE , ( who was married and lived elsewhere ) , had offered the other CARDINAL of the flat as a gift to GPE If the applicant refused to sell her CARDINAL for the price , which was offered to her , or to exchange it for a smaller flat on the outskirts of the city , ORG would move into the flat and create intolerable living conditions for her .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicant learned that on DATE Y. had signed a notarised gift deed in which he transferred his title to CARDINAL of the flat ( which was not as divided into allocated parts of the whole ) to GPE", "CARDINAL . From DATE ORG , ORG and their acquaintances started regularly visiting the applicant \u2019s flat , demanding that she sell . According to the applicant , on numerous occasions they broke the locks , insulted and harassed her and caused damage to her property . Subsequently a part and then the entire of ORG share in the flat was formally acquired by ORG as a gift , whose value amounted to CARDINAL NORP hryvnias ( ORG ) according to the gift certificates . However , irrespective of this transfer , ORG and ORG continued to act in concordance in demanding the applicant move out and sell her share .", "CARDINAL . For instance , on DATE ORG and FAC broke the locks on the entrance door when the applicant was away , entered the flat and , upon the applicant \u2019s arrival , reiterated their demands that she sell her share . As the applicant protested against their presence in the flat and their overall conduct , a conflict emerged , in the course of which ORG hit the applicant in the chest inflicting a bruise and causing soft tissue swelling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , GPE and several strangers broke into the applicant \u2019s flat again . As they were irritated by the barking of the applicant \u2019s dog , ORG started kicking her and chased her out . Subsequently the applicant found her dog \u2019s dead body in a garbage container .", "CARDINAL . Also on an unspecified date in DATE PERSON arrived in the flat after TIME ( when the applicant was already asleep ) and opened the balcony door , holding it open for TIME notwithstanding the freezing temperature outside . In response to the applicant \u2019s subsequent reprimands , he explained that he wished for her to catch a cold as she had been disagreeable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the applicant \u2019s daughter was visiting the applicant , PERSON arrived in the flat again . A conflict emerged , in the course of which ORG hit the applicant on the head and stomach , inflicting concussion and blunt trauma of the abdominal wall . He also hit the applicant \u2019s daughter on the head and other parts of the body , inflicting cerebral concussion and bruising of legs and arms . As a result of the conflict , the applicant and her daughter had to seek medical assistance for their injuries and the applicant received inpatient hospital treatment .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently GPE and ORG started installing in the flat from CARDINAL to CARDINAL strangers without the applicant \u2019s consent . These tenants , mostly young males , behaved in a discourteous way . In particular , they organised loud parties ; frivolously used , damaged and stole the applicant \u2019s belongings ; created insanitary conditions ; carelessly used electricity , gas and appliances , frequently left the entrance door open , and ignored requests to contribute towards the maintenance charges on the flat .", "CARDINAL . On numerous occasions the applicant attempted to drive the tenants away or to call them to order . Her efforts resulted in conflicts , in the course of which she was harassed and intimidated . Her attempts to replace the locks on the entrance doors to prevent unauthorised entry into the flat resulted in them being broken and in the tenants , who frequently changed , moving in again , in spite of her discontent . As she was unable to withstand such living conditions and was afraid for her life and limb , the applicant effectively moved out , contending herself with odd living arrangements . However , she paid short visits to the flat regularly , to supervise the situation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON drove his car onto the footpath , where the applicant was standing waiting for a bus , scaring and nearly hitting her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at CARDINAL TIME PERSON again arrived in the flat , when the applicant was in it , and demanded that she surrender her share . A conflict emerged , in the course of which FAC punched the applicant in the stomach , causing her physical pain .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL further occasions ( DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE ) the applicant was severely beaten by ORG , twice accompanied by his acquaintance PERSON The applicant suffered physical pain and bruising . On DATE , in addition to that , she also sustained a second concussion , which necessitated inpatient treatment .", "CARDINAL . On various dates the applicant learned that ORG and ORG had also acquired ownership of shares in numerous other flats in GPE and that they had behaved similarly with the co - owners of these flats , inducing them to sell their shares on unfavourable terms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON district prosecutor instituted civil proceedings on the applicant \u2019s behalf , seeking rescission of the gift deed between ORG and GPE and the eviction of the latter on the grounds that the gift deed had been executed without the applicant \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of Donetsk ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) allowed this claim , having found , in particular , that Article CARDINAL of LAW of GPE of DATE did not authorise the transfer of title to a part of shared property , which had not been divided into allocated parts and that it also obliged co - owners of a shared property to seek the consent of their counterparts before carrying out transactions in it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) quashed this judgment following an appeal by the applicants\u2019 opponent and dismissed the prosecutor \u2019s claim , having found that , unlike in the case of selling part of a shared property , giving it as a gift to a third party did not require the co - owners\u2019 consent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s and the prosecutor \u2019s requests for leave to appeal in cassation against ORG judgment . The judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted civil proceedings seeking the dispossession of GPE ( joined by ORG , when he acquired part of ORG share and replaced by him , when he acquired the entire share ) , of his share in the flat , regard being had to his unlawful conduct towards her , the impossibility of joint use of the flat , and his refusal to pay his share of the maintenance costs . She further sought a judicial rescission of their right to occupy the flat and compensation for the costs she had borne on the flat with their shares . The defendants lodged a counterclaim , alleging , in particular , that the applicant had been interfering with their personal life and belongings , provoking conflicts , harassing them and creating intolerable living conditions , which made it impossible for them to fulfil their desire to settle in the flat . They sought damages from the applicant for this conduct and demanded that the flat be divided into allocated parts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claim in part and dismissed her GPE counterclaim . In particular , referring to LAW of the new LAW of GPE of DATE , it ordered the dispossession of ORG ( by then the owner of CARDINAL the flat ) of his share against payment by the applicant of compensation in the amount of ORG CARDINAL . The court noted , in particular , that there was extensive evidence that the defendants had allowed numerous strangers to live in the flat ; that the applicant had been harassed ; and that the flat \u2019s appliances and the applicant \u2019s belongings had been misused and damaged . It further concluded that , regard being had to the flat \u2019s size and layout , it was not possible for the co - owners to use it jointly in a harmonious manner or to have it reasonably divided into CARDINAL independent CARDINAL for each of them to use separately . At the same time , ORG \u2019s dispossession in return for fair compensation would not put him at a substantial disadvantage , since he had another registered residence and predominantly used the disputed flat for subletting to other persons . The court next found that , since ORG had received the flat as a gift , fair compensation would be the payment of the indicative price ( UAH CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) declared by the parties as that share \u2019s value in the latest gift deeds . Finally , the court found that ORG and ORG had no longer any right to occupy the flat and ordered partial reimbursement of the maintenance costs incurred by the applicant on the flat .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having reviewed the case on appeal by the applicant \u2019s opponents , upheld the judgment with respect to the reimbursement of the costs borne on the flat by the applicant and the revocation of ORG right to occupy it , as he no longer owned any share in the flat . It then quashed the ruling to dispossess ORG , having noted that , according to the expert assessment , the market value of the disputed flat had been appraised at UAH MONEY , which meant that value of CARDINAL the flat had been ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The court further stated that the applicant \u2019s claim for dispossession of ORG and revocation of his right of occupancy had not been based on any legal provision . The relevant part of the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c Neither the provisions of LAW of GPE nor those of LAW of GPE of DATE , which the applicant cites as the basis for her claims , nor LAW GPE , envisage dispossession of the owner of his or her property and his or her eviction from a flat owned by him or her on the grounds cited by the applicant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed in cassation . She noted , in particular , that ORG and ORG had acquired shares in a number of GPE flats and had deliberately created intolerable living conditions for their co - owners in order to obtain the flats in their entirety on terms grossly unfavourable to the other co - owners . She further alleged that , having no other residence and being a victim of constant harassment , she had abandoned the flat and had been requesting refuge from various acquaintances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor also lodged a cassation appeal on the applicant \u2019s behalf , in which he corroborated her submissions that the defendants had been harassing her , had been using the flat in bad faith and had forced the applicant , a senior lady , to leave the dwelling she had occupied for DATE . He also alleged that the sum proposed by the applicant in compensation for the defendants\u2019 share in the flat had been fair , as it had been equal to the flat \u2019s value indicated in the gift deeds on the basis of which ORG had received the disputed share .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE it likewise rejected the prosecutor \u2019s request for leave to appeal and ORG judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . On numerous occasions DATE the applicant complained to the PERSON district police in GPE ( \u201c the district police \u201d ) about various instances of verbal and physical harassment , damage to and taking of her property and attempts by ORG and ORG to extort her share in the flat .", "CARDINAL . On various dates police officers arrived in the applicant \u2019s flat in response to her calls for help . They examined the situation , questioned the applicant and her opponents , and subsequently refused to institute criminal proceedings ( in particular , DATE , DATE and DATE ; CARDINAL and DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE and CARDINAL DATE ; DATE , CARDINAL and DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and DATE ; and CARDINAL and DATE and DATE and DATE ) . In their refusals , the police noted that the prosecution of ORG , ORG and their acquaintances was unwarranted since the relevant facts disclosed the existence of a chronic domestic conflict between lawful occupants of a flat , who attempted to engage the police in resolving their private disagreements . The hostilities took place inside the household and did not breach the public peace . Both parties had accused each other of provoking conflict and it was not evident , which party had in fact assaulted the other and which had acted out of selfdefence . In any event , during these conflicts the applicant had sustained no serious damage to her health and had not presented any evidence that her belongings had in fact been taken or damaged by the accused individuals . It was not possible to exclude that she had falsified the disappearance of her belongings in order to compromise the unwanted tenants . The police further recommended that the applicant resolve the dispute concerning the use of the flat in civil proceedings and assured her that \u201c pre - emptive conversations \u201d had been had with the purported offenders to foster respectful conduct on their part . On several occasions the police had issued official warnings to them , advising them of the impermissibility of antisocial behaviour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office quashed a decision not to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the injuries caused to the applicant on DATE . On several occasions the applicant enquired about the status of these proceedings and received no reply . In DATE the applicant was informed that the investigation had been suspended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the district police instructed his officers to place the applicant \u2019s flat on the police register for frequent visits with a view to preventing any offences and infringements of applicable law . He noted , in particular , that the investigations had confirmed the applicant \u2019s allegations concerning ORG \u2019s and ORG disruptive conduct . In particular , it had been established that they had been allowing numerous tenants to live in the co - owned flat , who had brought it into a decrepit and insanitary state . The persons who had been occupying the flat had also taken the applicant \u2019s personal belongings without her authorisation and had used her furniture , equipment and appliances in a careless manner , as a result of which these objects were deteriorating . Moreover , these persons had interfered with the applicant \u2019s ability to access the flat by changing the locks and thus effectively precluding her from living there . He also acknowledged that numerous pre - emptive conversations and warnings given by the police had not brought about any improvements .", "CARDINAL . On several other occasions ( in particular , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE ) ORG in GPE acknowledged , in response to the applicant \u2019s further complaints , that her allegations concerning ORG \u2019s and his associates\u2019 interference with her home had some basis . They further assured the applicant that her address had been placed on the police register for frequent visits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a private criminal complaint against ORG , ORG and ORG with ORG . Relying on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of GPE , she alleged that the defendants had systematically beaten and verbally harassed her . In this respect the applicant referred to the incidents of DATE and DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE above ) . She also submitted that , in her view , these incidents had to be approached not as isolated instances of ill - treatment , but as episodes of systematic and premeditated criminal conduct by an organised criminal association functioning with a view to extorting flats from GPE residents . She submitted that the same individuals had engaged in similar conduct vis\u00e0 - vis a number of other co - owners of properties in the city . Accordingly , she requested ORG assistance in transmitting her complaints to the public law - enforcement authorities with a view to instituting criminal proceedings concerning extortion and coercion .", "CARDINAL . On various dates CARDINAL other residents of GPE joined the proceedings , alleging that the same defendants had acquired shares in their flats and had been pressurising and terrorising them with a view to extorting the remaining shares .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON of ORG decided that the applicant \u2019s and other ORG allegations disclosed an appearance that serious crimes , warranting institution of public criminal proceedings , had been committed . Accordingly , the judge instituted criminal proceedings on suspicion of fraud , extortion , coercion , circumvention of the law and several other crimes , and transferred the case to the GPE regional prosecutor for investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office appealed against this decision , alleging that applicable law did not authorise judges to institute public criminal proceedings in the above circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s appeal and returned the case to ORG to be examined by another judge with respect to the complaints which could be addressed in private prosecution proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently ( DATE ) Judge PERSON of ORG returned the applicant \u2019s and other ORG submissions without examination . She found that the injured parties had failed to comply with the rules on territorial jurisdiction and with other unspecified procedural requirements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the regional police instituted criminal proceedings in respect of a complaint about extortion lodged by a certain ORG , who had allegedly been forced to abandon her flat on account of the intolerable living conditions created by the co - owners of her flat .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE deputy head of the regional prosecutor \u2019s office signed the bill of indictment in respect of ORG , ORG and ORG charging them , in particular , under LAW , with extorting property in an organised group and transferring the case to ORG of Donetsk ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) for trial .", "CARDINAL . On various dates in DATE the defendants were released from custody pending trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted all the defendants of the charges under LAW of LAW . It noted , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c ... The court comes to a conclusion that the basis of the present criminal proceedings is the existence of a private - law dispute between the defendants and the injured parties concerning the use of shared property , which the injured parties demand to resolve by way of criminal proceedings in view of their extremely antagonistic relationship with the defendants . \u201d", "DATE . On DATE ORG quashed this verdict on appeal by the prosecution and the injured parties and remitted the case for retrial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defendants were rearrested and placed in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that all the defendants were guilty of extortion under LAW and sentenced them to TIME ten and CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment respectively .
