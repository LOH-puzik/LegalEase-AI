MOLDOVA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of P1-1;Pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , ORG , is a company incorporated in GPE . From the moment of incorporation its shares were owned by GPE , NORP and NORP investors , it therefore qualified as a company owned by foreign investors and thus benefited from special incentives and guarantees under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Presidential Decree No . CARDINAL ( \u201c the Decree \u201d ) was promulgated . It made possible the creation and operation of duty free shops at land , water and air - border crossings . According to the Decree , the duty free shops were entitled to sell imported goods without having to pay customs tax ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company signed a contract with ORG , at the border between GPE and GPE , providing for the opening of duty free shops on the territory of the customs zone . The contract did not contain any provisions as to its duration . It was approved by the Head of ORG and by the Minister of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and on DATE the company obtained CARDINAL licences to operate a duty free shop and a duty free bar , within the shop , at ORG . The licences were issued in accordance with the Decree and they did not contain any provisions as to their duration . Subsequently , the applicant company bought the necessary equipment , built the LOC of the shop and bar and started operating them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made an amendment to LAW by which duty free sales outlets were thenceforward restricted to international airports and on board aircraft flying international routes ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the closure of all duty free outlets which were not located in international airports or on board aircraft flying international routes ( \u201c the order \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company , together with other companies similarly affected , lodged a court action against the order with ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued inter alia that the grounds relied on by ORG in closing down its duty free shop and bar were not enumerated in the exhaustive list of grounds for closing down such shops provided for in section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , in the light of CARDINAL of Law No . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the new amendments to LAW could not have retroactive effect and could be interpreted only as limiting the opening of duty free shops in the future , and not as closing down those already open .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the order conflicted with section CARDINAL of the Law on Foreign Investments ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which stipulated that the activity of a company owned by foreign investors could be terminated only by a governmental decision or a court order , and only when the company had seriously breached GPE legislation and its articles of incorporation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further argued that according to section CARDINAL of the Law on ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , in the event of the adoption of new , less favourable legislation , companies owned by foreign investors were entitled to rely on the old legislation for a period of DATE . The DATE period began to run from the date of enactment of the new legislation . Moreover , the second paragraph of the same section specifically provided that foreign - owned companies which enjoyed customs incentives in accordance with the former legislation of GPE had the right to enjoy those incentives after new legislation came into effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled in favour of the applicant company and quashed the order , relying inter alia on the following reasons :", "\u201c ... The court considers that the order of ORG . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , issued for the purpose of applying PERSON No . CARDINAL of DATE [ concerning the modification of LAW ] , by which the activity of duty free shops was terminated starting with DATE ... is illegal because it is contrary to the legislation in force .", "Law No . CARDINAL of DATE , by which LAW was modified ... does not provide for the termination of the activity of the duty free shops already open in places other than airports and on board aeroplanes .", "Moreover , the above mentioned Order [ of ORG ] runs contrary to LAW which does not provide among the reasons for liquidating a duty free shop the reason provided for in the Order \u2013 a change in the legislation .", "The ORG considers that the modified text of LAW can not have a bearing on the duty free shops already open and in operation , because this would also run contrary to LAW , which stipulates that a law can not be retroactive or ultra active .", "Since the applicants are enterprises with foreign investments , the ORG considers that the LAW runs contrary to LAW , which provides that the foreign investments are guaranteed full security and protection in GPE .", "Moreover , according to LAW , the applicants ' activity ... can be terminated only by means of a Government Decision or a court judgment and only if they have seriously breached the legislation or their statute of incorporation . However , the Order in question does not contain any reference to any breaches committed by the applicant and is not based on a Government Decision or a court judgment .", "It is necessary to indicate that in accordance with LAW , in case of enactment of new laws which change the conditions of a company with foreign investment created before the enactment of such laws , the company in question has the right to guide itself by the old legislation for DATE calculated from the date of enactment of the new legislation .", "According to the second paragraph of LAW of ORG , foreign investors and enterprises with foreign capital which enjoyed customs , tax and other incentives in accordance with the legislation of GPE formerly in force , have the right to enjoy these incentives after the new legislation comes into effect .", "...", "The court considers that the Order violated the applicants ' right to property guaranteed by LAW , DATE and CARDINAL of ORG and by LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed against this judgment to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed ORG appeal , quashed the judgment of ORG and dismissed the applicant 's action . The grounds relied on by ORG were as follows :", "\u201c The first instance court , in finding for the applicants , reached conclusions which are based on a wrong interpretation of the law because the Order in question does not provide for a total termination of the activity of duty free shops but only for the termination of their activity in certain places .", "Therefore the first instance court 's conclusion that the Order had as effect the termination of the entire activity of the foreign investors who had opened these shops and that thus their right to total security and protection provided for by LAW was violated is incorrect .", "Article CARDINAL of LAW , as modified by LAW . CARDINAL of DATE , defines the duty free as a customs regime which consists of sale of goods under customs supervision in especially dedicated places in international airports and onboard aeroplanes .", "Accordingly , through this provision the legislators regulate and limit the places in which such shops can be located but they do not create any interdiction in so far as their activity is concerned . Therefore the arguments of the first instance court that the right to activity of the foreign investors has been violated , is devoid of legal support . The applicants are not prohibited to place their shops in the places provided for by law , i.e. in airports and onboard aeroplanes .", "...", "According to the documents of incorporation of these companies , they practice different kinds of activities , including the sale of goods in the Duty Free regime .", "The conclusion of the first instance court that the Order violated the right to property guaranteed by the LAW and the international law is incorrect because the companies in question have the right to open duty free shops in other places , as provided by LAW . The activity of the companies is not totally stopped and nothing is taken away from them .", "...", "The first instance court 's reference to LAW which says that the activity of a company with foreign investment can only be terminated by a Government Decision or a court judgment is wrong because the Order did not totally terminate the applicants ' activity but only the sale of goods in the Duty Free regime . They can do other activities which are provided in their documents of incorporation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG did not express any view on the applicant 's argument or the ruling of ORG concerning the applicability of the second paragraph of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG to the case .
