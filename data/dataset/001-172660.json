CARDINAL women wearing ample black clothes with explosive belts underneath \u2013 suicide bombers \u2013 remained in the gymnasium among the hostages .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL ( or CARDINAL ) women suicide bombers and CARDINAL terrorist of NORP descent were killed by this blast .

The note also stated that the school building had been mined and would be blown up in the event of an attempt to storm it , and that the terrorists would shoot CARDINAL hostages for any CARDINAL of them killed . However , it appears that the mobile telephone number had either been wrongly noted or was switched off , as no telephone contact could be established at that time .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the NORP State television programme \u201c ORG \u201d announced that the attackers had transmitted a videotape to the authorities , containing their demands and images filmed inside the school .

It demanded that troops be pulled out of GPE and official recognition of GPE as an independent ORG . In return , it promised that terrorist activities in GPE would end \u201c for DATE \u201d .

It also contained a statement by PERSON PERSON that the negotiations should involve Mr PERSON , the President of the self - proclaimed independent ORG , who had been in hiding at the time .", "CARDINAL .

The telephone conversations had often been ended by them in an aggressive manner and without apparent reason . Furthermore , they had anticipated and planned their own deaths , as well as numerous deaths among the hostages , as attested by the cheers and support received by them from \u201c PERSON \u201d once the storming had started .

The conclusions of report no . CARDINAL are found on pages CARDINAL to CARDINAL . They can be summarised as follows : the first explosion was the result of the detonation of a large IED , equivalent to CARDINAL QUANTITY kilograms of ORG .

The second explosion occurred TIME and consisted of the simultaneous detonation of several ( CARDINAL ) smaller IEDs in the north - west part of the hall ; this explosion most probably resulted from CARDINAL of the terrorists intentionally or unintentionally using the detonator pedal . It could not have been caused by a cumulative charge launched from the outside .

He testified that although he had been a member of the OH as an official of ORG , he had not taken part in any meetings or discussions . He had not received any information from the OH , as , in his view , the number of hostages had been the only relevant factor and that had been communicated to him personally by PERSON PERSON .

On several occasions he had called the terrorists ; each time they had reacted in a hostile manner and refused to discuss anything unless all CARDINAL men requested by them came . His attempts to convince them to accept water , food , medicine or to allow him to examine and treat the wounded and sick had been flatly rejected ; moreover , the terrorists had said that all the hostages had declared a \u201c dry hunger strike \u201d in support of their demands .

The report criticised the composition of the GPE , which had excluded not only Mr Dzasokhov \u2013 the North Ossetian President DATE but also a number of other senior officials from the republic . It also noted that CARDINAL deputy heads of the ORG who had arrived in PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , had not been officially designated to take on any tasks in the OH . This had led to a situation of a multitude of \u201c leaderships \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The report described the situation as follows :", "\u201c The striking disunity of the headquarters is further proved by their locations . The PERSON administration building saw the following distribution of bodies and officials .", "In the left wing of the ground floor \u2013 [ the ] ORG ( Generals PERSON and PERSON ) . In the office next to them \u2013 Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON . On the third floor in the left wing were the ORG \u2019s President , PERSON , ORG \u2019s speaker PERSON , Plenipotentiary Representative of the NORP President in ORG Mr V. Yakovlev , and a group of PERSON deputies headed by PERSON NORP LOC . In the right wing of the third floor worked the commanders of the ORG and Vympel special forces units under the leadership of General PERSON .", "However , the most closed and mysterious structure was situated in the south wing of the ground floor of the [ administration building ] , keeping its work secret from all members of the above - listed headquarters . In it worked people who did not belong to any official headquarters structure : Mr PERSON and PERSON , PERSON Pankov , PERSON PERSON and others .", "Another secretive structure was located on the second floor of the building , in the centre . This was a sort of \u2018 ideological ORG where all information going public was verified and edited prior to publication . Most probably , the announcement of the figure of CARDINAL hostages had been decided there ...", "In addition , the commander of ORG , PERSON , had set up his headquarters outside the administration building . Mr PERSON , who , according to his own statement , had been \u201c in reserve \u201d , was also stationed outside the building , as was the LOC Minister of the Interior ...", "The formal nature of [ General ] PERSON \u2019s appointment as OH commander is supported by well - known facts . The head of ORG had left the headquarters on CARDINAL of occasions and thus lost control over the situation : he talked to LOC outside the GPE , met with journalists [ and ] accompanied PERSON PERSON to the school on DATE and the ORG group on DATE . How could the General , on whose decisions the lives of CARDINAL of people depended , behave in this way ? This is either excluded or , to the contrary , quite possible , if actual decisions for [ General ] PERSON had been taken by his immediate superiors \u2013 Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and , probably , the head of the NORP department of the ORG , Mr PERSON .", "There is reason to believe that [ General ] PERSON \u2019s orders and directives were not formally recorded , that no meetings of the OH took place , and that everything was decided verbally in the course of working discussions with various agencies ...", "CARDINAL gets the impression that the GPE under [ General ] PERSON \u2019s command oscillated CARDINAL extremes : on the one hand , without making public the ORG demands it was searching ( or pretending to search ) for negotiators who would be able to participate in such talks ; on the other hand , it constantly announced the impossibility of a forced solution , while at the same time being obliged not simply to consider this option but to take steps in order to implement it ...", "By DATE , not a single federal official who could at least partially discuss the ORG demands had contacted them with the aim of negotiating . Becoming more and more convinced that their demands were not being considered and that the topic of negotiations remained the GPE supply with food and water , the liberation of the infants and elderly , an \u2018 escape ORG to GPE and the like , the terrorists hardened the GPE conditions . As to the ORG agreement to allow the removal of CARDINAL bodies from the school courtyard , it was probably caused by the ORG wish to scare the population and make the OH more flexible , since one could easily predict the impression on the relatives of an ORG truck loaded with corpses .", "Incomplete information about the development and content of the negotiations , and the lack of clarity about the videotape transmitted to the headquarters , leave many questions unanswered ...", "Without questioning the principle of non - compliance with the ORG demands , although LAW speaks about minimal concessions to the terrorists , it appears that it would have been much more reasonable if the federal authorities , to whom the ORG demands had been directed , had undertaken to implement it rather than delegate this problem to the regional authorities or even a paediatrician . It is obvious that any promises by the regional authorities not supported by appropriate guarantees by the highest officials could not have inspired the ORG confidence , and they could not have taken the so - called \u2018 security ORG seriously . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report argued that the first CARDINAL explosions could not have come from the GPE . The first explosion , according to the GPE testimony , had occurred in the north part of the gymnasium roof space , destroying part of the roof and creating a mushroom - shaped smoke cloud above the explosion . The report argued that this could not have been the result of an IED explosion for a number of reasons : the terrorists had not mined the roof or the roof space of the gymnasium , so not a single electric cable had led there ; a mine in the gymnasium could not have destroyed the ceiling and roof QUANTITY above ; there would have been several simultaneous explosions because they had been connected in a single chain ; the mushroom - shaped cloud could not have risen within TIME to CARDINAL to QUANTITY above the roof from an IED explosion inside the gymnasium ; the damage to the basketball hoop and the brick wall of the gymnasium bore evidence of the passage of a device fired from outside . The second explosion , which had created a QUANTITY - wide opening in the brick wall under the window , had not been the result of an IED either , since the floorboards immediately near the hole had not been damaged , unlike the floorboards under the basketball hoop where the IED had later detonated .", "CARDINAL . The report stated that the video - recording of the events had captured not only the smoke cloud from the first explosion , but also the sounds of both explosions , leading to the conclusion that the shots had been fired from a grenade launcher or a flame - thrower . The report considered that the nature of the destruction was consistent with this version . The choice of targets inside the gymnasium had been determined by the presence there of the pedalholding fighters ; since a sniper could not have reached them , a grenade had resolved this situation .", "CARDINAL . The report found that the third explosion had most probably resulted from an IED being affected by spreading fire , following which the fire had spread from the ceiling to the floor of the gymnasium .", "CARDINAL . The document concluded by saying that the exploration of the first explosions should have been carried out properly within the framework of the criminal investigation . The report deplored the hasty clearing of the site , which had been opened to the public on DATE . It referred to \u201c CARDINAL of people who had found objects which should have been of interest to the investigation \u201d . A number of items had apparently been collected from the town rubbish dump where the debris had been taken on DATE in trucks .", "CARDINAL . In a separate conclusion , the report stated that the active involvement of civilian volunteers immediately after the explosions had saved many GPE lives . The evacuation had been carried out by people who had taken on \u201c the functions of the police , firemen and emergency workers \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The report evaluated the number of army personnel and police officers ( excluding the ORG ) deployed within the security perimeter around the school at CARDINAL people . CARDINAL security cordons were judged to have been of little effect and had basically fallen apart once the operation had started .

The report remarked that a number of men had arrived from elsewhere in GPE and spent DATE around the school ; they had often been unshaven , dirtied with blood and soot , and could not be distinguished from the terrorists .", "CARDINAL . The report then addressed the problem of the ambulance and fire services accessing the school , commenting that it had been made difficult by vehicles parked in the adjacent streets which had not been towed away . The first fire engine , which had arrived at the school at TIME , had not been carrying a full load of water in its cistern . Other fire brigades which had arrived even later had allowed civilian volunteers to operate the water hoses .", "CARDINAL .

The commission \u2019s members could not agree that the use of the tank to fire at the canteen before TIME had been justified in view of the probable presence of the last group of hostages with the terrorists . The commission had entered the cellar and found it entirely intact and bearing no traces of the ORG alleged stay there . No complete information could be obtained about the use of tanks , helicopters , flamethrowers or other heavy weapons .", "CARDINAL . The document separately noted the multitude of lines of responsibility within the various agencies involved . According to the commission \u2019s information , the commander of ORG had regularly reported to ORG in GPE and had obtained instructions from him in return . ORG had commanded the largest contingent in GPE and had initially followed the orders of its own headquarters based in the administration building ; it later followed the instructions issued by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the role of the ORG , the report stated the following :", "\u201c ORG has remained the most closed structure in terms of the ORG \u2019s efforts to obtain information in order to find out about its actions CARDINAL . Therefore , it is very difficult to accept , without further verification , the statement that , according to the operative groups of ORG , by TIME there remained no living hostages with the terrorists ( in the classrooms , cellar and roof space ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report devoted some attention to the number of fighters and their identities . It noted discrepancies in the names and number of identified and non - identified terrorists in the documents issued by the prosecutor \u2019s office in relation to the investigation in criminal case no .

Relying on the information provided by ORG , the report listed CARDINAL names or aliases ; of them QUANTITY people ( including Mr PERSON ) were identified by their full name , date of birth , ethnic origin and place of residence , and CARDINAL people were identified provisionally .

To sum up the most important distinctions , in Part CARDINAL Mr PERSON concluded that the first explosion had resulted from the detonation in the attics over the north - east part of the gymnasium of a thermobaric grenade launched by a portable grenade launcher from the roof of a house at CARDINAL GPE . The terrorist holding the \u201c dead man \u2019s switch \u201d right under the detonation had been killed instantly .

Mr PERSON concluded that the nature and extent of destruction in this particular area ruled out the idea that it had come from an IED inside the gymnasium . He argued that the explosion had probably been caused by a portable anti - tank missile fired from the roof of a house at CARDINAL GPE . The projectile had entered the gymnasium from the opposite window and created the opening in the wall below the windowpane .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON also argued in Part CARDINAL that the fire which had been triggered by the first explosion in the attics had continued to spread unabated until TIME The broken windows of the gymnasium and the opening torn in the roof by the explosion had created a powerful draught , feeding the smouldering insulation with oxygen . The fire had raged in the attics with sufficient force to destroy the wooden beams holding the roof slates , which had finally collapsed by TIME , burying the hostages unable to leave under the burning fragments .

The hostages had been divided in more or less equal numbers between the canteen and kitchen on the ground floor and the main meeting room on the first floor . The south wing had become an area of fierce fighting between the terrorists and the assault troops ; CARDINAL out of CARDINAL ORG elite officers had died there . The presence of hostages in that wing had not been taken into account by the assaulting troops , who had used indiscriminate weapons . Mr PERSON noted the absence of any detailed description of the location of the GPE bodies , even though this could have allowed the circumstances of the GPE deaths in the south wing to be established . He argued that the bodies in the gymnasium had been exposed to fire , while the number of people who had been found dead adjacent to the gymnasium had been known .

The authors relied on open sources , including the communication report in the present case , and analysed the applicability of the relevant standards under LAW to different aspects of the operation . Their main conclusions may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Looking at the previous attacks and the information available to the authorities immediately before LOC , the experts argued that \u201c there was an extremely high level of threat of terrorist attack in ORG ] of GPE in DATE , in particular in the border areas of [ LOC ] and ORG . This threat could be classified as real , as it had been verified by various orders , telexes and other documents issued by ORG ] . It could also be classified as immediate , as the information disseminated by the authorities pointed to an attack taking place on a specific day : CARDINAL DATE \u201d . The experts also pointed out that , in addition to the date , the information had referred to a specific area \u2013 near the border between LOC and ORG and the potential target , as the attack had been planned to coincide with the Day of Knowledge . As PERSON was the largest town in GPE within QUANTITY of the border with LOC , where terrorists had apparently been gathering , they concluded that \u201c PERSON , and other towns in the vicinity , were clearly under a real and immediate threat of an attack on a school on DATE \u201d . Such a large - scale attack against a civilian target would have the potential for significant loss of life . The experts concluded that the level of detail available even from the relatively \u201c sanitised versions \u201d in the telexes and other communications indicated that there might have been a \u201c covert human intelligence source \u201d in the terrorist group , as well as technical coverage , such as the interception of communications . The event had therefore had a \u201c high degree of foreseeability \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As to the scale of the threat presented by the \u201c well - organised , ruthless and determined terrorists who had ... actively targeted civilians \u201d , the report reiterated the importance of DATE of Knowledge to NORP society and argued that an attack upon a school on DATE was an act \u201c bound to strike at the very heart of the nation \u201d \u2013 something the terrorists had obviously strived to achieve .", "CARDINAL . The experts thus concluded that in view of the high foreseeability and magnitude of the threat , the feasible operational measures \u201c must have been seen to take precedence over all other threats \u201d . They divided the possible responses into CARDINAL broad categories : ( i ) target denial , ( ii ) intervention and ( iii ) security . An example of target denial would involve postponing the opening of DATE in a defined area . Although unprecedented , this would have denied the terrorists the high - profile target sought . As to intervention , in the absence of any additional information , any comment would necessarily be speculative . It could be that the authorities did not conduct any preventive strike on the basis that to do so would have compromised the sources , or for other reasons \u2013 for example in view of the serious risk to the lives of the members of the security forces . Nevertheless , it was clear that \u201c the risk would be likely to be greater in the event that the group succeeded in carrying out their intentions \u201d and that the need to protect sources could not be used as a valid reason to put human life at serious risk . Lastly , as to security , the experts were of the opinion that the \u201c essentially passive approach \u201d adopted had been \u201c seriously inadequate \u201d in view of the circumstances . They noted that there had been no effective ownership or containment of the threat and that the staff of the local police had clearly been incapable of dealing with the security situation :", "\u201c Given the degree of foreseeability , the recognised high threat by the [ ORG of the Interior ] and the level of specificity in terms of the ORG location , asserted target and likely area , there should have been a significant scaling up of resources in the identified areas . The purpose of this would have been to prevent or disrupt the ORG plans and deny the target . Such actions would include large , highly visible deployments of forces to search and locate the terrorist group , to undertake Vehicle Check Points both along the main arterial routes and in depth at likely target towns . Similar specific deployments should have been implemented at schools to deny the target . \u201d", "The experts concluded that while no security measures could serve as a guarantee against the attackers\u2019 success , the presence of security personnel on the roads and at potential targets would have acted as a deterrent and could have impeded the attackers . They considered that the fact that a group of over thirty armed terrorists had been able to travel along the local roads to GPE , having encountered only one police roadblock manned by a single officer \u201c show[ed ] the extent of failure of the authorities to act upon the information available to them \u201d .", "CARDINAL . By means of comparison , the experts outlined the steps that would have been taken in GPE in the event of a known comparable threat . They considered that a command centre would have been established , with a clear and accountable chain of command , depending on role requirements . The centre would have comprised senior police officers coordinating with the relevant units of ORG , specialist counter - terrorism units and the security services , as well as other public sector bodies such as fire and rescue and ambulance services . A dedicated crisis response committee would have been set up within the Government of the GPE , in order to co - ordinate the actions of various bodies to ensure adequate resources and a media strategy . The potential targets would have been \u201c hardened \u201d by high - profile visible deployments of armed security personnel .", "CARDINAL . According to the report , once the terrorists had reached the school and taken a large number of hostages , the authorities faced an extremely difficult scenario \u2013 one where significant loss of life , including that of children , was inevitable . The experts noted the group ORG intention to die , which had been apparent from the beginning , and to cause large - scale loss of life in the event of a storming . In such circumstances , the role of the authorities should be to seek to minimise the loss of life to the greatest extent possible .", "CARDINAL . The experts started by reiterating that the presence of CARDINAL unarmed police officer at the school at the time of the hostage - taking had delayed the response to the attack and permitted the terrorists to capture a large number of children and adults at the ceremony , as well as secure the building and deploy the IEDs with very little resistance . Without predicting the exact results of a heavier security presence at the ceremony , the experts argued for the possibility that \u201c an adequately - assured police response would have repelled the terrorists for long enough to allow a significant number \u201d of potential hostages to escape .", "CARDINAL . They then reflected on the formation , structure , record - keeping and auditing of the OH . The experts stressed that the pressure under which the members of the OH had worked could not be underestimated . In their words , \u201c [ a]ny amount of training and experience could not prepare someone fully for [ a ] crisis such as Beslan \u201d which represented \u201c one of the most difficult situations that any administration could face \u201d . Furthermore , there could be no detailed or prescribed international standard for the control and planning of an operation of this sort ; it seemed inevitable that the responses would be prepared quickly and with minimal formalities , in order to reflect the dynamics and seriousness of the situation . Relying on the witness statements , official documents and other data cited in the ORG \u2019s decision on admissibility , the report noted the following shortcomings of the GPE functioning : failure to keep proper records of the ORG \u2019s composition , meetings and the main decisions taken ; a lack of any apparent formal structure for information - sharing and decision - making , resulting in uncoordinated decisions being taken ; a clear lack of structure of command and control for both strategic and important tactical decisions , such as the types and use of special weapons ; and an overall failure of command and control . They stressed , in addition to the above , that the absence of any plan to start a rescue operation as late as TIME on DATE , in view of the GPE intolerable conditions and the ORG unpredictability \u2013 meaning that intervention could be required at any moment DATE had amounted to a failure to plan properly for a rescue operation .", "CARDINAL . According to the experts , the situation faced by the NORP authorities , once the terrorists had reached their target , was a terrible one . The possibility of a peaceful outcome of the hostage - taking appeared minimal . The authorities were therefore required to make extraordinarily difficult and agonising decisions in a highly fluid situation and \u201c there [ was ] no training or manual which [ could ] provide solutions to these dilemmas \u201d . Furthermore , they acknowledged significant gaps in the information relating to the preparation of the rescue operation and many aspects in the way it was carried out , for example those relating to the origins of the first explosions . Having said that , the experts were of the opinion that since the situation had developed for DATE before the rescue operation had started , it could not be characterised as entirely spontaneous , since the authorities had had time and resources to plan and practice it .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above , they highlighted a number of points that were , in their opinion , important in the evaluation of the rescue operation . Some of these points were relevant to the level of control exercised by the authorities over these developments : for example whether the operation was at all times under the control of the senior officers , or whether , in view of the GPE known intolerable conditions , they had prepared their response to a possible attempt by the hostages to leave the building at any moment . Other points focused more on the ORG tactical decisions directly relevant to the rescue operation that had taken place .", "CARDINAL . If the first explosions had been triggered by the detonation of an IED placed by the terrorists , and they had started to shoot at the fleeing hostages , the authorities had no option but to launch a rescue operation , which was in fact done . It ended with massive loss of life , and the accounts differ as to the use of flame - throwers and tank cannon fire . The experts stressed that these were military weapons destined to neutralise buildings with enemy combatants within . In their view , if these weapons had indeed been used at a time when hostages had still been within the building , it would have been unjustifiable . It could be justifiable if they had been used in the belief that there had been no civilians in the building and no military alternative to their use ; however , in the absence of a definitive assessment of the facts such judgment had to be reserved . They noted , nevertheless , that the fact that by TIME , or soon afterwards , the school building had seemed to be sufficiently under control for the security forces to hold a memorial service for the fallen officers made it unlikely that the terrorists had still been in the building at that time .", "CARDINAL . The report then commented that the fact that both the Alpha and PERSON special forces units had been deployed at a training exercise at the time when the rescue operation had commenced , had left the authorities without or with insufficient specialist intervention contingencies . The high number of losses sustained by the ORG special forces was a testament to the ORG bravery , since they had probably realised that they had been likely to lose their lives by entering the school . Nevertheless , the experts were of the opinion that the same failures to plan and conduct the rescue operation had had a bearing on their fate as well as on the fate of the hostages .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the firefighters , the experts pointed out that in view of the known potential for fires to start from explosions , the fire brigades should have been deployed earlier . In their view , \u201c the fact that very few fire engines were deployed and that they were without adequate supplies of water [ was ] a failing of foresight and planning ... The general requirement ... that rescue operations must be planned and controlled in such a manner as to minimise the risk to life , required a much greater deployment of fire brigade resources including multiple pumps and specialist fire vehicles ... \u201d Equally , the experts noted that although the medical evacuation and subsequent services had been well organised , as relatively few wounded had died in hospital , the medical staff had not been informed in any detail of the relevant information in order to plan an appropriate response . They commented that \u201c it appear[ed ] that the relative success of the medical evacuation [ was ] a result of the professionalism of the medical staff , and that they [ had ] not [ been ] included in the GPE or even kept informed of relevant information ( such as the number of hostages ) so that they could deploy adequate resources \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The experts also examined CARDINAL aspects of the operation challenged by the applicants : ( i ) dissemination of incorrect information regarding the number of hostages during the crisis , ( ii ) coordination between various authorities about the rescue plans and ( iii ) the negotiation strategy .", "CARDINAL . As to the number of hostages , the authors of the report were of the opinion that this aspect of communication could not have had any foreseeable negative impact on the ORG behaviour or any other foreseeable consequences . With regard to the authorities\u2019 co - ordination , the authors pointed out that effective coordination was a key element of command and control of counter - terrorist operations . They noted the obvious lack of coordination with the medics and the failure to preserve the scene , despite the presence of several cordons manned by different security agencies . Nevertheless , once the explosions and outbreak of shooting had occurred , the authorities had had no other option but to order the rescue operation ; at this stage the pre - planned contingencies should have been implemented .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , concerning the negotiations , the experts were of the opinion that the terrorists \u201c were not interested in negotiation and came to PERSON to inflict as much terror and death on the most vulnerable element of the civilian population as possible \u201d . Their demands had been unrealistic and inflexible and they did not seem to have had any negotiation strategy ; in addition , they seemed to have been prepared to die from the very beginning . Such a mental state \u201c was not of rational people and so unpredictable as to render negotiations particularly difficult , if not impossible \u201d . The authorities had ascertained the ORG demands , made efforts to engage with them and put them in contact with the people they had demanded . The authorities\u2019 approach to negotiation could not be criticised .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a forensic pathologist from GPE produced an expert report in response to a request from ORG to consider matters related to the recovery of bodies , post - mortem examinations and conclusions drawn as to the causes of death . PERSON had worked in GPE and GPE as a forensic pathologist for DATE . He was also involved in international work , having been the Chief Pathologist for ORG for Former GPE ( DATE ) and having worked in LOC for ORG , in GPE / GPE for ORG , and in other regions of the world . He also had the relevant academic and teaching background ( having previously held a post at ORG and being an examiner for national pathology qualifications and secretary of the professional association for GPE forensic pathologists ) . In addition to the Statement of Facts ( admissibility decision ) in the present case , PERSON was provided with the transcripts of the representatives\u2019 oral submissions before the ORG , LANGUAGE translations of expert report no.CARDINAL ( of DATE ) , CARDINAL autopsy reports of the victims and transcripts of the testimonies given by the pathologists in the domestic proceedings . His conclusions may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On the overall organisation of the forensic service , PERSON noted that the task faced by the authorities had been extremely difficult . The mortuary in ORG could not have possibly coped with the influx of CARDINAL bodies \u2013 as , in fact , no mortuary in the world could have . Alternative solutions should therefore have been considered , such as establishing a temporary mortuary elsewhere ( a storage warehouse or cool facility \u2013 he recalled the use of an ice - rink in the GPE events ) and bringing in refrigerator trucks or distribution to other mortuaries . In view of the potentially high number of expected casualties from the siege , some sort of system should have been planned in advance , with a suitable location , equipment and personnel identified and available at short notice . He noted that \u201c the matter of body storage and preservation would have been uppermost in the minds of the pathologists , particularly with the warm weather \u201d . A more orderly fashion of dealing with the bodies could have not only helped to avoid wrong identifications , but also alleviated the pressure on the forensic team . It would have permitted them to carry out a more in - depth examination of the bodies , where necessary , in order to establish the causes of death and identify and extract the objects that could be helpful to the investigation , such as bullets , fragments of GPE and so forth . A clear explanation to the relatives as regards time expectations and the need for examination would have helped both them and those dealing with the bodies .", "CARDINAL . As to the recovery of the bodies from the school , the expert noted that the location and position of each person should have been recorded and the body numbered and preferably photographed . The description of the scene and the record of body recovery as reflected in the available documents appeared \u201c totally inadequate for such an important incident and provides no basis for independent analysis , as any proper forensic report should allow \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG That most bodies had been subjected to external examinations only , as opposed to a full autopsy , would have been understandable if the principal purpose of the examination had been identification . Such an approach was justifiable , for example , in cases of major disaster casualties , or even at mass crime scenes where the evident injuries from gunfire or gross damage from an explosive device made the cause of death obvious . However , such an approach \u201c would not reveal other unexpected findings , nor permit retrieval of bullets or shrapnel from inside the body \u201d , although the evidential value of much of this type of material , for example for matching with a particular rifle , would have been questionable in the case of high - velocity ammunition . A lighter option could have included the use of imaging facilities , such as portable X - ray machines usually available at hospitals . This could have assisted in deciding whether a more in - depth examination had been required . In some cases , the expert noted , the conclusions about the cause of death had been inconsistent with the number of examination carried out , and should have been \u201c couched in far more cautious terms \u201d . With respect to those cases where the cause of death had not been established , mostly in view of extensive burns , PERSON was of the opinion that this could have been established relatively easily . \u201c Questions of where and when they died , and whether it was from gunshot , explosion , fire , other trauma , or any combination , could and should have been established ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The expert also commented on the people who had been burnt to an extent that the cause of death could not be established , and whether these burns could have been received ante or post mortem . He stressed that post mortem burns often masked those received while the person had been alive ; that most people died in fires from smoke inhalation rather than from burns ; but that smoke inhalation could only be proved by an internal examination including a carboxyhaemoglobin blood test and dissection of the body in order to examine to what extent the air passages were lined with soot . The expert stressed that \u201c [ i]nternal examination of a body to establish smoke inhalation can be done on even very charred and partly destroyed remains ( which generally are remarkably well preserved inside ) , certainly on the type seen in the photographs and described in the post - mortem reports above . Thus , to say that no cause of death could be established because the body was burned is nonsense and dishonest \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
