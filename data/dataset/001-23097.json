He is represented before the ORG by Mr NORP O\u2019Connell , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a NORP national , who came to GPE in DATE using his brother \u2019s passport and was granted permission to remain for DATE . On CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was arrested in a public house in GPE , on suspicion of drug dealing and possession of an offensive weapon . Upon arrest he gave the name PERSON . After being interviewed by the police , he was arrested and interviewed again by an Immigration Officer called GPE as a suspected \u2018 ORG . PERSON knew the applicant \u2019s true identity and in a report dated CARDINAL DATE , described the applicant as \u2018 extremely violent\u2019 and indicated that he should be detained . However , over DATE , GPE , together with PC PERSON from \u201c NORP \u201d , ( a special operations unit of the LOC police ) , recruited the applicant as a police informer . With the assistance of GPE the applicant completed an application for political asylum and was released on temporary admission to GPE on DATE .", "The applicant was not charged with any drugs offences despite the fact that a substance later proved to be cocaine had been found on him when he was arrested in DATE . In DATE he appeared before ORG in respect of the offence of possession of an offensive weapon and was fined , having pleaded guilty in the name of PERSON . Immigration Officer PERSON was at court . DATE , the applicant had his first official meeting with his handlers and began to supply information about the activities of NORP \u2018 Yardie\u2019 gangs operating in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant was arrested for an offence of rape and was detained in custody . Whilst detained he was visited by GPE and another officer and on DATE PC PERSON and a ORG attended ORG in an attempt to persuade the prosecutor not to object to bail . On DATE the rape proceedings were discontinued and , although they would later deny it , the applicant believed this was as a result of intervention by his \u2018 CARDINAL .", "DATE and DATE the applicant gave information to police about the alleged criminal activities of PERSON , known as \u2018 Miss V\u2019 , involving drug dealing and false passports . On DATE , the applicant gave information to PC PERSON about Miss V \u2019s son , PERSON . PERSON was arrested DATE in possession of a handgun and ammunition and was subsequently sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "On or about DATE , a DATE , PERSON ( known as \u2018 Zena\u2019 ) was murdered . She had been stabbed some CARDINAL times and the prosecution case was that she had been raped before being killed . Her body was not found until TIME of Friday , DATE . The door to her flat was unlocked and the telephone had been left off the hook . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was interviewed as a potential witness . His former girlfriend , PERSON , with whom he was still living , was a friend of PERSON and his fingerprint had been found on a glass in the deceased \u2019s flat . The applicant said he knew of her , but had not actually met her before the afternoon of DATE , when he went to her house with a mutual friend , PERSON , to buy cannabis . He did not disclose that he had had a sexual relationship with the deceased .", "In DATE the applicant \u2019s DNA profile was matched with semen samples taken from the deceased \u2019s vagina and he was arrested for her murder . When interviewed in DATE he said that he had been having a sexual relationship with the deceased for some time and had returned to her house on DATE , DATE to have sex with her , but she had been alive when he left and she must have been murdered some time after he last saw her .", "The fact that the applicant was an informant became known to the officer in charge of the murder investigation , PERSON , who informed ORG ( ORG ) in DATE . PERSON was told by a colleague about a telephone call the applicant made from prison to PC PERSON , in which he had asked if something could be \u2018 sorted out\u2019 . ( He later confronted PC PERSON about the call , who denied any knowledge of it ) . PERSON visited SOCARDINAL and looked at the applicant \u2019s Informant file but did not see anything of relevance to the murder investigation and took no further action . Senior officers at SOCARDINAL gave instructions that there was to be no further contact with the applicant . In DATE the murder proceedings against the applicant were discontinued , counsel having advised that there was insufficient evidence to proceed , and he was released from custody .", "As far back as DATE the decision had been taken to refuse the applicant \u2019s application for asylum , but the letter of refusal was not served on him and no steps were taken to deport him . At some point after the DATE decision to discontinue the murder proceedings , contact was resumed between the applicant and PC PERSON .", "ORG PERSON obtained authority to resume the murder investigation and on DATE PERSON made a witness statement in which she said that she had been with the applicant on an occasion in DATE when he appeared worried about police questions and asked her what \u2018 forensic\u2019 meant . He had a bag in which she saw a pair of bloodstained trousers , which he then took to be dry cleaned . PERSON was the niece of PERSON and the granddaughter of Miss PERSON She had not made a statement to the police during the initial investigation . The police also then obtained further evidence from a mobile telephone company tending to show that the applicant was near or at ORG flat on TIME , when the prosecution believed her to have been murdered and when the applicant claimed to have been at home . The applicant was re - arrested on DATE .", "At the start of the trial , on DATE , the prosecution made an application for public interest immunity ( ORG ) in respect of the fact that the applicant was an informant . The applicant had not told his own legal representatives and the defence team were not aware of his status as an informant . Prosecuting counsel told the trial judge that the applicant was an informant and that he had had involvement with the police and with GPE . Counsel had not been told that the applicant had informed on the relatives of the prosecution witness PERSON and both prosecuting counsel and the judge were unaware of any possible relevance to the trial of the fact that the applicant was an informant . Prosecuting counsel made it clear to the judge that he did not know whether the applicant had told his own solicitors or counsel that he was an informant . The judge ruled that there should be no order for disclosure .", "After the ORG hearing , PERSON was approached by a journalist who said that he knew the applicant was an informant and asked if the officer knew anything about the discontinuance of the proceedings in DATE being as a result of an approach to the ORG by SOCARDINAL . PERSON brought the conversation to the attention of prosecuting counsel . Counsel took the view that the conversation had no relevance to the trial and it was not brought to the attention of the judge . During the trial , the same journalist discussed his knowledge of the applicant \u2019s informant activities with members of the deceased \u2019s family and others in the public gallery , some of whom were friends of prosecution witnesses . CARDINAL of the group told the journalist that he knew the applicant was an informant and he wanted him to be convicted of the murder . The deceased \u2019s sister discussed the conversations with PERSON , who did not confirm or deny that the applicant was an informant .", "The prosecution evidence at trial included details of when , where and to whom the applicant had made telephone calls , revealing inconsistencies in his account , the telephone evidence that he was near to the flat on DATE TIME , evidence from PERSON and PERSON about the applicant \u2019s movements and the account of PERSON . In addition , the clothing found on the deceased , stained with the applicant \u2019s semen , was not the same as the clothing she had last been seen in by PERSON in TIME , tending to suggest that the applicant had had sexual intercourse with her after , rather than as he said , before that time . In cross examination PERSON credibility was to some extent damaged when she claimed that on DATE the applicant told her the police were harassing him about a murder , that is , before the body had been discovered .", "The applicant disputed the alleged time of death and relied on the evidence of a pathologist to the effect that the murder was more likely to have taken place on DATE , DATE . He maintained that he had not seen the deceased after they had consensual sexual intercourse on DATE , CARDINAL DATE . He called alibi evidence for the DATE TIME , including evidence from a PERSON , ( against whom it later transpired he had informed ) .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted of the murder by a majority of CARDINAL . On TIME of the applicant \u2019s conviction , a story on the television news referred to the applicant as a police informant . Subsequently , information about the applicant \u2019s activities as an informant appeared in newspaper articles , a television programme and a book . In DATE the applicant was served with the letter written in DATE , confirming that his application for asylum had been refused .", "Following a complaint by the deceased \u2019s relatives , a police inquiry was held ( ORG ) . From DATE a large volume of material was collated . Those who made statements in the course of the inquiry included PERSON and PERSON It was clear from the statements that they and many others had suspected or known before the murder that the applicant was an informer and that he had given information leading to the arrest and imprisonment of PERSON . It was also suspected that he had informed on a relative of another prosecution witness ( who had not in the event been called to give evidence at the trial ) . It was not clear whether they had said this to the police when they initially gave their statements in the murder investigation . PERSON gave evidence to the inquiry and confirmed that he was unaware of any connection between the information given by the applicant and the murder investigation until after the trial .", "The applicant lodged grounds of appeal in DATE , and his application was referred directly to ORG , who granted leave to appeal . The court ordered disclosure of statements and documents from ORG and part of the applicant \u2019s Informant file . It was only as a result of the disclosure that the applicant \u2019s representatives became aware of the information the applicant had given about the relatives of PERSON and others and of the discussion between the journalist and PERSON during the trial . They also became aware that a senior officer from SOCARDINAL had attempted to see the applicant in the cells during his trial to inform him that his status as an informant had become known , but that this was no fault of SOCARDINAL . The ORG representative at court had refused the officer permission to visit the applicant . The applicant lodged more detailed grounds of appeal in DATE following the disclosure ordered by the court .", "In DATE , the applicant argued before ORG that , ( a ) the ORG should have disclosed to the applicant \u2019s representatives the fact that he was an informer and the nature of the information he had given , ( b ) the ORG should have made the same disclosure to the trial judge , ( c ) the judge was wrong to make no order for disclosure on the ORG hearing , ( d ) the restricted information given to the trial judge meant that he was unable properly to fulfil his functions and discretion as to disclosure , ( e ) the ORG should have disclosed to the applicant and/or his lawyers and the trial judge the fact that some prosecution witnesses knew he was an informant , ( f ) when it became known , the ORG should have disclosed to the judge , the applicant and/or his lawyers that press and members of the public knew of the applicant \u2019s status , and ( g ) the reason the applicant had not told his lawyers of his informant status was because his handlers had put pressure on him not to .", "ORG heard evidence from the applicant , his handlers and PERSON . The court noted that the information given by the applicant ( in particular that relating to the relatives of PERSON ) was relevant to an issue in the case , but there was no duty on the Crown to disclose it as it was known to the applicant , who chose not to disclose it . The judge had been correct to make no order for disclosure . There were good public policy reasons why information given confidentially to the ORG by the applicant should not be disclosed to his lawyers without his permission . The court did not accept the applicant \u2019s argument that pressure had been put on him by his handlers not to reveal his status to his lawyers . Having heard evidence from the applicant on the point the court found him to be untruthful .", "As to the submission that the applicant and/or his lawyers should have been told when it became apparent that the knowledge of his informant status had become public , Lord Justice PERSON said :", "\u201c It is a matter of some concern that not even the judge was told of this development . Had it come to the knowledge of the appellant it may very well be that it would have worked a change of heart with regard to telling his counsel about his informant status .... There was no longer any good reason for keeping the information to himself and counsel would have been free to cross - examine PERSON as to motive . We say \u2018 free to cross - examine\u2019 advisedly . It would have been a matter requiring careful thought . After all ... cross - examination on the lines suggested could have had a serious down side , namely the loss of the alibi witness , PERSON , against whom the appellant had informed and the introduction of the risk of character being put in issue . \u201d", "ORG considered that ORG was an accurate and truthful witness and accepted that neither he nor prosecuting counsel had any reason to know the relevance of the applicant \u2019s informant status to the issues in the trial . The court went on to conclude that the possible advantage to which the applicant could have put the information was not without risk , and in any event the ORG \u2019s case did not depend on PERSON evidence . Evidence of the applicant \u2019s guilt was overwhelming . On DATE the appeal was dismissed .", "The procedure to be applied when determining questions of disclosure was governed at the time by common law . At common law , the prosecution has a duty to disclose any material which has or might have some bearing on the offence charged .", "In DATE the Attorney - General issued Guidelines , which did not have the force of law , concerning exceptions to the common law duty to disclose to the defence evidence of potential assistance to it ( ( DATE ) CARDINAL Cr . App . PERSON ( \u201c the LAW ) ) . According to the LAW , the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within CARDINAL of the categories set out in paragraph CARDINAL . CARDINAL of these categories ( CARDINAL ) ) was \u201c sensitive material \u201d which , because of its sensitivity , it would not be in the public interest to disclose . \u201c Sensitive material \u201d was defined as including :", "\u201c ... ( b ) it is by , or discloses the identity of an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger ; ... \u201d", "According to paragraph CARDINAL ,", "\u201c ... in deciding whether or not statements containing sensitive material should be disclosed , a balance should be struck between the degree of sensitivity and the extent to which the information might assist the defence . \u201d", "The decision as to whether or not the balance in a particular case required disclosure of sensitive material was one for the prosecution , although any doubt should be resolved in favour of disclosure .", "In NORP v. Ward ( [ DATE ] vol . CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports p. CARDINAL ) ORG stressed that the court and not the prosecution was to decide whether or not relevant evidence should be retained on grounds of public interest immunity . It explained that :", "\u201c ... a judge is balancing on the one hand the desirability of preserving the public interest in the absence of disclosure against , on the other hand , the interests of justice . Where the interests of justice arise in a criminal case touching and concerning liberty or conceivably on occasion life , the weight to be attached to the interests of justice is plainly very great indeed . \u201d", "ORG judgment in PERSON , ORG . CARDINAL Cr . App . PERSON ) set out the procedures to be followed if the prosecution wished to withhold unused material from disclosure on grounds of public interest immunity including , where appropriate , making an application to the court ex parte . It referred to the important role performed by the trial judge in monitoring the views of the prosecution as to the proper balance to be struck and remarked that even in cases in which the sensitivity of the information required an ex parte hearing , the defence had \u201c as much protection as can be given without pre - empting the issue \u201d . Finally , it emphasised that it was for the trial judge to continue to monitor the position as the trial progressed . Issues might emerge during the trial which affected the balance and required disclosure \u201c in the interests of securing fairness to the defendant \u201d . For this reason it was important for the same judge who heard any disclosure application also to conduct the trial .", "In NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] vol . CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports p. CARDINAL ) , the Lord Chief Justice , giving the judgment of ORG , held that the prosecution should put before the judge only those documents which it regarded as material but wished to withhold on grounds of public interest immunity . \u201c Material \u201d evidence was defined as evidence which could be seen ,", "\u201c ... on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution : ( CARDINAL ) to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case ; ( CARDINAL ) to raise or possibly raise a new issue whose existence is not apparent from the evidence which the prosecution proposes to use ; ( CARDINAL ) to hold out a real ( as opposed to fanciful ) prospect of providing a lead on evidence which goes to ( CARDINAL ) or ( CARDINAL ) \u201d .", "Once the judge was seized of the material , he or she had to perform the balancing exercise between the public interest in non - disclosure and the importance of the documents to the issues of interest , or likely to be of interest , to the accused . In that respect , the more full and specific the indications given of the issues the defence were likely to raise , the more accurately the prosecution and judge would be able to assess the value to the defence of the material . If the disputed material might prove the defendant \u2019s innocence or avoid a miscarriage of justice , the balance came down firmly in favour of disclosing it . Where , on the other hand , the material in question would not be of assistance to the accused , but would in fact assist the prosecution , the balance was likely to be in favour of non - disclosure .", "In NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] Cr . App . CARDINAL ) , ORG referred to the duty of the trial judge to keep material under review and to the duty of prosecuting counsel to inform himself fully about the content of any \u201c disputed material \u201d , so that he was in a position to invite the judge to reassess the situation if appropriate . The court recognised that there was a limit to the scope of discovery required of the ORG however , and for example , there was no legal duty on the Crown to disclose material which was only relevant to the credibility of a defence witness . ORG ( [ DATE ] A.C. CARDINAL ) , confirming the ORG of Appeal decision , observed that :", "\u201c ... the common law rules are concerned essentially with the disclosure of material which has been gathered by the police and the prosecution in the course of the investigation process for use in the case to be made for the ORG . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
