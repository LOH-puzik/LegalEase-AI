SERBIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Deprivation of property)", "JUDGES": "Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Guido Raimondi;Helen Keller;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant bought a car ( ORG CARDINALD ) from a person who lived in GPE . His intention was to use it as a taxi . Since the car was already DATE , the applicant was unable to have it directly registered in GPE . Therefore , he first had the car registered in GPE , in his relative \u2019s name , and only registered the car in GPE in DATE , which was when the latter State adopted legislation making this arrangement possible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE issued a decision stating that the applicant , being a taxi driver since DATE , would from now on be using the car at issue as a taxi .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police seized the applicant \u2019s car because of a customs violation ( carinski prekr\u0161aj ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG za carinske prekr\u0161aje ORG ) discontinued the misdemeanour proceedings ( prek\u0161ajni postupak ) brought against the applicant , but decided nevertheless to confiscate his vehicle . ORG explained that it was convinced that the applicant had committed the offence in question , i.e. that he had accepted to import a vehicle which could not have legally been imported and had not informed the competent customs authorities thereof , but noted that the misdemeanour proceedings could not be continued in view of the applicable \u201c relative prescription \u201d period ( relativna zastarelost ) . The confiscation , however , was warranted since no \u201c absolute prescription \u201d ( apsolutna zastarelost ) had occurred ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against this decision , noting that ORG had failed to properly establish the relevant facts , and had also come to \u201c an erroneous legal conclusion \u201d leading to the ultimate confiscation of his car .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG finansija ) rejected this appeal . In so doing , it stated , inter alia , that absolute prescription had not occurred and that the impugned confiscation was thus lawful .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date thereafter the ORG apparently sold the applicant \u2019s car to a third person . The money thus obtained was deposited with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal on points of law ( zahtev za vanredno preispitivanje pravosna\u017enog re\u0161enja ) , re - stating his earlier arguments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law and upheld the impugned decision of ORG , as well as its reasoning .", "CARDINAL . The Government disagreed with some of the facts provided by the applicant and furnished additional details , which may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant bought a second - hand car ( ORG CARDINALD ) in DATE from a person who lived in GPE . The car \u2019s former owner returned the licence plates to the competent NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . At that time and given the vehicle age limitation requirement , the car in question could not have been legally imported to GPE . In any event , even if this were possible , the applicant would have had to pay a significant sum for customs duties and taxes , i.e. a total of PERCENT of the catalogue value of the car .", "CARDINAL . At some point in DATE the Government announced that it was considering a decree which would make it possible to import cars from CARDINAL of the former NORP republics free from any duties or taxes , and irrespective of the vehicle \u2019s age . This decree was ultimately adopted in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then used forged documents to prove that the car had been registered in GPE , in another person \u2019s name , for DATE . Thus he secured the enjoyment of the benefits provided by the said decree and succeeded in registering the car in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE found the applicant guilty of having committed the crime of securing official certification of false information ( navo\u0111enje na overavanje neistinitog sadr\u017eaja ) . In particular , ORG established that the applicant had submitted a forged document , i.e. a false NORP - Herzegovinian traffic permit , meant to indicate that the car in question was being imported from GPE , rather than GPE , on the basis of which the competent NORP authorities had issued him with a NORP traffic permit ( saobra\u0107ajna dozvola ) . The applicant , who had paid MONEY ( DEM ) for the car , was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Okru\u017eni sud ) in GPE upheld this judgment on appeal , and it thereby became final .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that customs - related misdemeanour proceedings may not be instituted if DATE have elapsed as of the date of commission of the offence in question ( relative prescription ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that a vehicle used for the commission of a customs - related offence may be confiscated even when , for legal reasons , no proceedings may be brought against the perpetrator , except in cases of absolute prescription .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that even if misdemeanour proceedings have been instituted absolute prescription shall occur when twice the time required for relative prescription has elapsed .", "CARDINAL . ORG no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE published an amendment to this LAW , whereby , inter alia , LAW DATE was repealed in its entirety .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , LAW DATE , as amended , substantively corresponds to LAW of the former LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and CARDINAL two separate decrees were adopted by ORG ( ORG o registraciji vozila iz biv\u0161ih republika SFRJ koje nisu u sastavu Savezne Republike Jugoslavije , published in OG FRY no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and ORG o posebnoj naknadi za registraciju odre\u0111enih PERSON , published in OG RS nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL . ) They set out the requirements for the registration of certain vehicles in GPE , including those registered in CARDINAL of the former NORP republics .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that objects used for the commission of a crime may be confiscated if they belong to the perpetrator .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL provide , inter alia , that any pecuniary benefit obtained as a result of the commission of a crime shall be confiscated . The pecuniary benefit in question may include money , physical objects and any other valuables . Should confiscation in kind be impossible , the perpetrator may be obliged to pay a certain sum which shall be proportionate to his or her illegal gains ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
