{"ITEMID": "001-80800", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "HOMANN v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently detained in GPE .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of rape and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . Furthermore , the court ordered the applicant \u2019s placement in preventive detention pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 , below ) .", "Since DATE the applicant , having served his full prison sentence , has been remanded in preventive detention .", "In the course of proceedings for review of whether the further execution of the applicant \u2019s placement in preventive detention should be suspended on probation , the ORG summoned the applicant to a hearing on DATE .", "By fax of CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged a motion with the ORG to revoke the designation of his court - appointed defence counsel . He argued that following the counsel \u2019s visit in prison on DATE , there was no longer a relationship of trust between him and his counsel . He informed the court that he would not appear at the hearing scheduled for DATE as no proper defence had been set up . He further objected to the report submitted by expert ORG on the risk of his being recidivist as the expert had not been able to consult the complete case - files .", "On DATE the president of the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to revoke the appointment of his counsel as illfounded . He argued that under section CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( CCP ) , it was possible to revoke the designation of an officially appointed defence counsel if the mutual trust between the defendant and the lawyer was seriously disturbed . However , the applicant failed to substantiate this since he had not given any reasons for his allegation that there was no longer a relationship of trust between him and his counsel .", "On DATE the ORG refused to suspend the applicant \u2019s placement in detention on probation following a hearing on DATE . At the hearing the applicant \u2019s court - appointed defence counsel and the expert were present . As announced in his fax to the court , the applicant himself did not attend the hearing . Having regard to the report submitted by expert PERSON , ORG found that it could not be assumed that the applicant would not commit further offences if released from prison . It stated that the expert had convincingly argued that the applicant , as shown by his offence , was still dangerous for the public . Even though he had committed his last offence DATE , there were no signs that the applicant , who kept claiming to have been wrongfully convicted , was no longer likely to be recidivist .", "On DATE the applicant received a copy of the decisions taken by the ORG and its president by post . ORG informed him that the decisions had been formally served on his defence counsel . Other than the letter to his counsel served on DATE , the letter to the applicant did not contain instructions about his available legal remedies ( Rechtsmittelbelehrung ) .", "By submissions dated DATE , which reached ORG on DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal against the aforementioned decisions of the ORG and its president .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision not to suspend his placement in preventive detention on probation as inadmissible . The court found that the applicant had not lodged his immediate appeal ( sofortige Beschwerde ) with ORG as prescribed by section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 , below ) , but directly with ORG . ORG had not been obliged to forward the appeal to ORG , as it had already been lodged out of time when received by ORG . Pursuant to sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 , below ) , the applicant had to lodge his immediate appeal within DATE after ORG decision , including instructions about the available legal remedies , had been served on his lawyer on DATE . The applicant had , however , failed to lodge his appeal until DATE at the latest with the ORG .", "ORG further dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the refusal of the president of ORG to revoke the designation of his court - appointed defence counsel as ill - founded . Endorsing the reasons given by ORG , it argued that the applicant failed to substantiate that there were circumstances warranting the conclusion that the relationship of trust between him and his courtappointed lawyer was considerably and irrevocably disturbed to an extent which rendered the conduct of a proper defence impossible . In particular , it had been objectively justified for the defence counsel to refuse to lodge motions aimed at challenging the applicant \u2019s conviction in DATE . The lawfulness of this conviction was not at issue in the proceedings concerning the necessity of the applicant \u2019s continued placement in preventive detention .", "On DATE the applicant filed a remonstrance ( Gegenvorstellung ) against the decision of ORG dated DATE dismissing his immediate appeal against ORG decision not to suspend his placement in preventive detention on probation . He complained that ORG letter of CARDINAL DATE to him had not contained instructions about the available legal remedies . He had not been in contact with his officially appointed counsel after CARDINAL DATE . He further argued that ORG had been obliged to give him an opportunity to supplement the reasons why there was no longer a relationship of trust with his lawyer .", "On DATE the ORG , interpreting the applicant \u2019s remonstrance as a request for reinstatement of the proceedings ( Wiedereinsetzung in den vorigen Stand ) , dismissed this request . It found that the applicant had not substantiated that he had been prevented from observing the DATE time - limit for lodging an immediate appeal without fault of his own ( section CARDINAL ORG , see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 , below ) . Instructions about the available legal remedies were and had to be given solely to the applicant \u2019s lawyer , on whom ORG decision had been formally served ( sections ORG and LAW , see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 , below ) . There was no obligation under LAW to enclose such instructions also in the letter sent to the applicant ( section GPE CARDINAL ORG , see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 , below ) . In that letter , ORG had informed the applicant of the contents of ORG decision and of the fact that it had been served on his counsel . He should therefore have contacted his lawyer without undue delay in order to be informed about the further course of the proceedings or to mandate him to lodge an appeal .", "On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s further remonstrance against its decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s further requests for reinstatement of the proceedings .", "On DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s further remonstrances .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG against the aforementioned decisions taken by ORG and ORG . He argued , in particular , that the failure to grant him access to ORG in order to complain about the refusal of the ORG to suspend his placement in preventive detention on probation had violated his right to a fair trial as guaranteed by LAW . ORG had notably failed to inform him about the available legal remedies against its decision of CARDINAL DATE . Moreover , his right to a fair hearing had been breached in that ORG had not revoked the designation of his court - appointed counsel without giving him an opportunity further to substantiate why there was no longer a relationship of trust between him and his counsel .", "On DATE ORG , without giving reasons for its decision , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "Decisions which are not taken in the presence of the person concerned shall be notified by service thereof ( section QUANTITY of Criminal Procedure \u2013 CCP ) .", "The court - appointed defence counsel is considered authorized to accept service of documents on behalf of the defendant ( section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG ) . If a decision is served on counsel for the defence , the defendant shall be informed thereof ; at the same time he shall be provided informally with a copy of the decision ( section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG ) .", "Upon notification of a decision the appeal against which is subject to a time - limit , the person concerned shall be given instructions about the options for contesting the decision and the prescribed time - limits and forms ( section ORG ) .", "An appeal against a decision ( Beschwerde ) shall be lodged with the court which took the contested decision , either orally to be recorded by the court \u2019s registry or in writing ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG ) .", "An immediate appeal ( sofortige Beschwerde ) shall be lodged within DATE ; the time - limit shall start running upon notification ( section CARDINAL ORG ) of the decision ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG ) .", "Section CARDINAL provides that if a person was prevented from observing a time - limit without fault of his own , he shall be granted reinstatement of the proceedings ( Wiedereinsetzung in den vorigen Stand ) . Failure to observe the time - limit for lodging an appeal shall be considered as not due to his fault if the instructions pursuant to section ORG have not been given .", "The sentencing court may , at the time of the offender \u2019s conviction , order his preventive detention in addition to his prison sentence if the offender is sentenced for an intentional offence to DATE imprisonment , has previously been convicted and detained ( for certain periods fixed by law ) and proved dangerous for the public ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "The court dealing with the execution of sentences may review at any time whether the further execution of the placement of a convicted person in preventive detention should be suspended on probation . It is obliged to do so DATE ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
