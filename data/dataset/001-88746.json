The applicant was arrested on DATE and subsequently remanded in custody by ORG on suspicion of founding and leading a criminal armed gang within which he had ordered various crimes to be carried out , such as murder , robbery and drug trafficking . He was also accused of illegal possession of weapons and their use in assault and battery . In view of the fact that the applicant had been seriously injured by an explosion in his car on CARDINAL DATE , the court had regard to a medical opinion given by experts from ORG of ORG . The experts found that there had been no indication that the applicant \u2019s detention would pose a danger to his health or life . The experts concluded that the applicant should receive appropriate medication and have unrestricted access to medical advice or be hospitalised on the ward of the detention centre . Accordingly , the court stressed in its decision that the applicant should receive adequate medical assistance during his detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant unsuccessfully appealed against that decision . On DATE he requested that the detention order be quashed , arguing , firstly , that there had been no reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and , secondly , that he had been arrested at a hospital while being treated for injuries sustained as a result of a bomb explosion in his car .

According to CARDINAL opinions , the applicant \u2019s detention in a detention centre could constitute a serious danger to his health and life .

On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention pending investigation was extended by ORG . The court was of the view that the suspicion against the applicant was reasonable and confirmed by witness testimonies and by evidence obtained during searches . It had also been established in the course of the investigation that the members of the gang were close and , hence , in view of the fact that most of them were sought by means of wanted notices , the applicant \u2019s detention was the only measure capable of ensuring the proper conduct of the investigation and preventing him from colluding with co - accused . The court took into account the serious nature of the offences with which the applicant had been charged and the severity of the penalty to which he was liable . The court also referred to a medical opinion of CARDINAL DATE stating that there were no grounds for finding that the detention created any serious risk for the applicant \u2019s health or life . The decision was upheld on DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was subsequently extended by the same court \u2019s decisions of DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE . They were based in particular on the need to conduct further complex investigative measures , the need to obtain extensive evidence and the fear of the applicant colluding with other gang members or absconding . The risk was very serious in view of the applicant \u2019s position in the criminal world and the fact that other members of the gang were still sought by the police .", "CARDINAL . The bill of indictment against the applicant and CARDINAL co - accused was transferred to ORG on DATE . The prosecutor requested CARDINAL witnesses and CARDINAL experts to give evidence and extensive documentary evidence was also submitted .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the director of the detention centre submitted a medical opinion prepared by a doctor from the remand centre and subsequently another by an orthopaedist . The specialists recommended that the treatment be continued and confirmed that the applicant was receiving adequate medical assistance .
