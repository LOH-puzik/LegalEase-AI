They brought a court action against authorities , claiming MONEY for the loss of their real property left in GPE , including a house and a chicken farm , and MONEY ( \u201c RUR \u201d ) for the loss of their movable effects .", "On DATE the ORG of GPE ( \u201c the Town Court \u201d ) dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim in their absence , having heard the respondent authorities . The court referred to the ORG request to consider the case in their absence . The court found that in DATE the authorities had paid the applicants ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the loss of their real property and FAC for the movable items left in GPE , which they had proved to have owned in accordance with a special governmental decree on compensation for the material losses of NORP refugees . The court found that the applicants had proved that they had a flat of QUANTITY , for which they had been awarded the above sums . The court held that the applicants had not substantiated their case to the extent that they had claimed to have lost further real or movable items .", "The applicants appealed against the above judgment , stating that the court had failed to assess properly the evidence in the case .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal in the absence of the applicants and in the presence of the governmental authorities , finding that the applicants had not proved the alleged pecuniary damage .

This resulted in the applicants\u2019 nonattendance , which , in turn , adversely affected the fairness of the trial .", "On DATE ORG of GPE granted the application , quashed the said decisions and remitted the case for a fresh examination at first instance .", "On DATE ORG refused to examine the applicants\u2019 case on the ground of the applicants\u2019 persistent failure , namely on CARDINAL occasions , to appear before the court . It appears that the applicants did not appeal and the decision came into force .", "On DATE the Deputy President of ORG of GPE lodged an application by way of a supervisory review , requesting ORG to quash the decision of DATE on the grounds of the court \u2019s failure to deal properly with the applicants\u2019 reluctance to attend the court hearings , for example by examining the case in their absence , and the court \u2019s failure to send them a summons to appear to all known addresses and not just to CARDINAL address .", "On DATE the ORG of ORG granted the application , quashed the decision and remitted the case to the first - instance court for a fresh examination .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 claims . The court observed that on DATE the applicants received compensation of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and RUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the loss of their real property and for the movable items left in GPE . The court next held that the applicants had not substantiated their case to the extent that they had claimed to have lost further real or movable items . Their claims were accordingly rejected .

It appears that they did not express in their appeal any concern about the first - instance court \u2019s examination of the case in their absence .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal and upheld the judgment of DATE . It appears that neither the applicants nor the respondents attended the appeal hearing .", "The applicants were involved in a number of other legal disputes with the authorities concerning various social benefits , including , in particular , their claims for a new car , higher salary and pension , and index - linked savings . The domestic courts examined those claims and dismissed them as unfounded ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
