At her request , on DATE its ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the Board \u201d ) approved the applicant \u2019s acquisition . Before she moved in , ORG became aware that the applicant \u2019s son , Mr A , had caused serious problems in ORG , where the applicant had previously been part owner and resident and where in DATE her son had cohabited with her . ORG therefore became particularly concerned that only the applicant move into the cooperative and informed her that it contemplated withdrawing its approval of her as a part owner . It asked her to make a written undertaking to the effect that Mr A would not move to the apartment in X. In this connection , ORG referred to the fact that in her request for approval of her part ownership she had indicated that her household would consist of CARDINAL person .", "CARDINAL .

By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , Attorney PERSON , on the behalf of ORG , pointed out to the applicant that Mr A seemed to have moved to her apartment , in breach of the conditions for the approval of her as part owner .

Attorney PERSON added that the conditions for eviction under section CARDINAL - CARDINAL had been fulfilled , but that for the time being it had been deemed sufficient to order sale of the apartment .", "CARDINAL . Upon expiry of DATE time - limit for sale , set pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , Attorney PERSON , who had succeeded Attorney PERSON as the applicant \u2019s representative , responded by a letter of CARDINAL DATE that the order of sale would not be complied with .", "CARDINAL .

The sentence included the conditional part of a sentence imposed by ORG in a judgment of DATE by which Mr A had been convicted of an offence under LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In meting out the sentence , ORG attached considerable weight to the fact that Mr A had twice ( last time in DATE ) been convicted for a number of offences of a similar nature , that he had actively approached the victims , and that his conduct to a great extent affected people in their homes and closest environment , thereby destroying the GPE and their NORP feeling of safety and wellbeing at their homes and in the near vicinity .

By a judgment of DATE , ORG convicted PERSON A of the above charges . It found proven , not that he had taken a strangulation grip on PERSON , but that he had intentionally pushed her against a door or a wall with one hand ; that he had pushed Mr PERSON or hit him in his chest but not that he had hit him hard ; and that he had held around Mr D.H. \u2019s chest and had pushed him against the wall , both in the staircase and in the garage but that he had not hit Mr D.H. ORG observed that , while all CARDINAL offences would normally warrant the imposition of fines , Mr H.F. \u2019s advanced age and frailness were an aggravating factor as were the number of the offences adjudicated as well as the fact that Mr A had been convicted in the past for similar and in part more serious offences . He had moreover not understood the gravity of his actions . ORG sentenced Mr A to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Mr A did not lodge an appeal against the above judgment which thus became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a warning of compulsory sale ( section CARDINAL of LAW , tvangsfullbyrdelsesloven ) and on DATE it instituted proceedings against her before the relevant section ( GPE byfogdembete ) of ORG ( tingrett ) , to obtain an order of compulsory sale of her apartment , from a specialised judge entrusted inter alia with such matters .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , represented by the same lawyer as before ORG , reiterated that according to section CARDINAL of LAW the case ought to be examined under an ordinary procedure ( i s\u00f8ksm\u00e5ls former \u2013 which in principle included an oral hearing if the respondent \u2019s objections against compulsory sale was not \u201c clearly groundless \u201d ) . In her written pleadings she sought to address this question legally and factually , while pointing out that a complete presentation of evidence would be made at a later stage ( i behandlingen av s\u00f8ksm\u00e5let ) . She submitted notably as follows .", "CARDINAL . In the first place the applicant requested ORG to dismiss the case on the ground that the ORG \u2019s decision had not provided a legal basis for Attorney PERSON to initiate proceedings against her for compulsory sale . The decision had stated \u201c GPE \u201d , not PERSON , and \u201c eviction \u201d , not compulsory sale ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . She also argued that it would create an unreasonable situation if ORG interest in her removal were to carry more weight than her needs at DATE in not being put on the street . She had previously moved from the previous ORG to ORG and had left old disputes behind her . However , because of a warning system within the FAC system ( a cooperative building association owned by its CARDINAL members and which included both ORG ) , already before moving into X she had been persecuted by allegations related to Y. There would hardly be any alternative for her . The situation had evolved over time and she ought to be entitled to admit PERSON A in her household . Due to her age , she had become increasingly dependent on his assistance .", "CARDINAL . NORP The criminal matters pertaining to Mr A dated far back in time and could not justify compulsory sale , especially since the situation had improved and both the applicant and Mr A were open to negotiate on other appropriate default measures . The most recent offence dated from DATE . The decisions on restraining orders ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) could not carry any weight since the threshold for prohibition on contact was low and did not require a preponderance of probabilities . The alleged harassment and threats was in great part due to a paranoid perception of some of the neighbours .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested ORG , before conducting any procedure on the merits , to first decide on her request that the case be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . By a decision ( kjennelse ) of DATE , ORG upheld ORG request for an order of compulsory sale of the applicant \u2019s apartment , to be carried out by an official assistant ( medhjelper ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG first dismissed the applicant \u2019s contention that there was no decision by ORG which could constitute a basis for compulsory sale . The mention in the decision of \u201c GPE \u201d could not be understood in any other way than as referring to the applicant . From section CARDINAL of LAW , it clearly followed that it was the applicant , as the owner of the apartment in question , who was the person whom ORG ought to address in all cases concerning the owner \u2019s duties and responsibilities . It was the owner \u2019s breach of such that could justify an eviction order . It followed from the case - law and legal doctrine that the owner was to be identified with the members of his or her household , both in the sense that faults on their part were relevant and that an eviction measure would also concern them ; it was not possible to limit a request for an eviction order to concern CARDINAL or some of the members of a given household or to concern only the owner and not the other occupants .", "CARDINAL . ORG further rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that the ORG \u2019s decision did not concern compulsory sale ( \u201c tvangssalg \u201d ) but only eviction ( \u201c utkastelse \u201d ) . ORG lawyer had stated that ORG was of the view that the conditions for eviction had been fulfilled but that the ORG had opted to limit its demand by initiating proceedings for compulsory sale . Since the ORG \u2019s decision on eviction implied compulsory sale , to proceed with the latter and less extensive measure first clearly fell within that decision . This did not exclude that a request for an eviction order be made subsequently .", "CARDINAL . No arguments had been raised by the applicant suggesting that ORG demand ought to be dismissed . Nor was there anything to indicate that Attorney PERSON had exceeded the powers conferred on him by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , no objection had been made as regards the contents of the plaintiff \u2019s claim for an order of compulsory sale or about the requirements as to warnings . The formal requirements for seeking an order of compulsory sale had been fulfilled ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Act ) .", "CARDINAL . The condition for requiring sale was that the owner of the part in question had \u201c substantially defaulted \u201d his or her obligations ( \u201c misheld pliktene sine vesentleg \u201d ) . The request for compulsory sale ought to be referred for examination according to the ordinary procedure applicable to ordinary appeals ( which in principle include an oral hearing ) if , within the statutory time limit , objections had been raised against compulsory sale that could not be regarded as \u201c clearly groundless \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The assessment of whether \u201c substantial default \u201d had occurred concerned not only the owner \u2019s conduct but also that of other members of his or her household , as the owner undoubtedly ought to be identified with them . In the instant case , the circumstances that could justify enforcement measures related to the conduct of Mr A.", "CARDINAL . In this regard , ORG observed that it was undisputed that the reason why the applicant had been obliged to leave her apartment in ORG had been the serious problems that her son had caused there . In applying to ORG for its approval to become a new part owner , she had requested approval for CARDINAL person only . Accordingly , it ought to be assumed that only she would occupy the apartment . Before moving in , she had confirmed through her lawyer that her household consisted of CARDINAL person . Previously she had written to ORG without replying to questions of whether her son would move in . It was only after ORG request to the applicant of DATE for confirmation that Mr A would not move to the estate that Attorney PERSON had responded in the affirmative by letter of CARDINAL DATE . She was then well informed that it was precisely the matters regarding her son which was the reason for the ORG \u2019s request for confirmation that he would not move into the flat .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the then applicable LAW , an approval of a new part owner could be withdrawn within DATE if the owner had provided inaccurate , or withheld , substantial information and the owner ought to have been aware of this . In view of the situation at the material time and the applicant \u2019s confirmation , ORG could assume that the applicant had committed herself to moving in alone and in any event without her son . Both the ORG \u2019s approval and her confirmation had dated DATE back in time and it was only at present that she for the first time had alleged that ORG had forced her to make the said declaration by threatening to take unlawful action . On this point , ORG observed that the only measure which ORG contemplated was to refuse approval of the applicant as a new part owner and there was nothing to indicate that it had been unlawful to envisage such a measure .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , where the board of ORG had become aware that problems with a part owner had occurred in ORG , it ought to be able to take the matter into account in its assessment of whether or not to approve that person as a new part owner . There were no elements to suggest that the information received by ORG had been obtained in an unlawful manner . Whether and to what extent any outsiders had acted unlawfully was not for ORG to consider in the present case .", "CARDINAL . It was unclear at what time Mr A had moved into the applicant \u2019s apartment . According to ORG judgment of DATE , Mr A had stated that he was living in Z Street CARDINALC. From the same judgment it appeared that the criminal offences for which he was convicted had occurred in FAC CARDINALB and CARDINALC in DATE . It was also undisputed by the applicant that she had been cohabiting with Mr A in her apartment for an extended period . However , since the applicant , as a part owner , was responsible for the conduct by members of her household as well as her visitors , it was not decisive when Mr A had moved in .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that it was clearly established that Mr A , by the judgments of DATE and DATE respectively , had been convicted of having committed violent assault and frightening behaviour against CARDINAL neighbours at FAC CARDINALB and CARDINALC. The episodes in the DATE judgment had occurred on CARDINAL and DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE . The DATE judgment described inter alia Mr A as a person who perceived everyone in respect of whom there was a contradiction or a disagreement as being part of a conspiracy against him ( for further details see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . His use of violence was perceived as unprovoked . He had infringed people at their homes , in such a way as to destroy the GPE and their NORP sense of safety and wellbeing at their homes and nearby . According to an assessment of PERSON A made by a court appointed expert in DATE , he extensively and systematically had perceptions and experiences of conspiracy which were almost impossible to influence and which according to the DATE judgment were still prevailing at that time .", "CARDINAL . The judgment of DATE had concerned episodes from DATE and DATE and DATE involving violations of LAW ) of LAW . Also in this judgment it had been found proven that Mr A had generally behaved in an intensive and intrusive manner . He was tall and strong , went very close to the person with whom he wanted to discuss and shouted to them with a load and aggressive voice . He was moreover inclined to block the passage of people he wanted to talk to and had a low threshold for taking CARDINAL step further and grab or push people . This he did in a manner which was so aggressive as to make people anxious of the possibility of further and more serious violence being perpetrated .", "In addition to the above - mentioned judgments , he had been imposed restraining orders by the police prohibiting him from visiting the following neighbours :", "- Ms T.L.B. and her children , for the period from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE ;", "- Mr H.F. , from DATE to DATE ;", "- Mr D.H. , from DATE to CARDINAL DATE ; and", "- Mr J .- E.S. , from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . All these matters showed a person who over a long period had displayed frightening and disturbing behaviour vis - \u00e0 - vis a number of neighbours in ORG where he was living with his mother , and where the incidents had led to convictions and prohibitions on contact over longer periods . It was also undisputed that Mr A had reacted with a particularly high degree of intensity vis - \u00e0 - vis the Board and some of its members .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s allegation that the conditions had improved and that both she and Mr A were prepared to negotiate on alternative default measures , ORG noted that ORG communications to the applicant had led to tirades of phone calls and e - mails with accusations against members of ORG and complaints to different public institutions . This was also supported by the description made by ORG in its judgment of DATE . As the applicant had failed to indicate what other appropriate default measures could consist of , the respondent ORG could not be required to take further initiatives in this case .", "CARDINAL . Whether the conditions for ordering compulsory sale had been fulfilled essentially depended on whether substantial default and conduct in breach of section CARDINAL had materialised at the time when the order of sale was issued ( namely DATE ) .", "DATE \u2019s conduct had caused serious disturbance to other occupants and had violated section CARDINAL of LAW . For this reason , the issuing of a warning before compulsory sale had not been a requirement .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view the applicant \u2019s interests on account of her old age ought not to carry more weight than those of other occupants in ORG . It found it established that her obligations as a part owner had been seriously defaulted , in any event DATE . Whilst it was understandable that it was more difficult for a person aged CARDINAL to find and move to a new home , this could not be decisive in this case where neighbours had been harassed over DATE . Despite her own confirmation that she moved in alone , the applicant had let her son live in the apartment with all the problems this had caused to other occupants . Therefore , she ought to bear the consequences of her own choice even though this were to make it problematic for her to find another house within ORG system .", "CARDINAL . The DATE \u2019s decision on eviction had been taken on DATE , DATE after Mr A \u2019s conviction of DATE and DATE after his commission of CARDINAL of the offences . This was his second conviction for offences committed against neighbours while the first had concerned offences committed in DATE . ORG had taken and followed up its decision with reasonable expedition .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the applicant \u2019s contention that the police had acted in breach of their duty of confidentiality , by providing information to ORG concerning Mr A in relation to FAC , could have no bearing on the present case .", "CARDINAL . Considering all of the applicant \u2019s pleas against compulsory sale as being \u201c clearly groundless \u201d in the sense of sections CARDINAL , cf . section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , ORG upheld ORG claim and ordered that sale take place by an assistant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against ORG decision to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) , complaining of the former \u2019s assessment of the evidence , its application of the law and procedure . Maintaining in the main her arguments before ORG , she requested that ORG action be dismissed ; in the alternative , she argued that the request for compulsory sale was unlawful in that no evidence had been adduced to show that she had defaulted her obligations vis - \u00e0 - vis ORG or , in any event , that any such default had been substantial . In the further alternative , she submitted that , after refusing to dismiss the suit , ORG had failed to refer her case for examination according to the ordinary procedure ( involving in principle an oral hearing ) and had wrongly considered her objections against compulsory sale as being clearly groundless ; therefore , she asked ORG to quash ORG decision and to refer the case back for re - examination in accordance with the ordinary procedure . The applicant submitted that she could not cope with the thought of having to move house again and that she never believed that she would have to do so . The apartment really suited her and the fact that her son lived with her had made her feel that she received the help and care she needed in DATE life .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected her appeal . From the outset it observed that sufficient light had been shed on the case for it to determine the appeal on the basis of the written case - file ( LAW ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s allegations that the imposition of compulsory sale suffered from deficiencies , ORG found it clear that the ORG \u2019s decision provided an adequate basis for notifying her of the measure in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not find it necessary to take a stance on whether the terms \u201c eviction case \u201d ought to be read as relating to the vacating of LOC ( compare paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In that event , as also assumed by ORG , it was obvious that there was a possibility to opt for the less intrusive measure , namely the imposition of an order to sell the flat . The above decision most probably was an acknowledgment of a request by ORG to its attorney to take the necessary steps to bring the ORG \u2019s relationship with the applicant to an end . More than this could not be required , bearing in mind especially the long historical background to the case .", "CARDINAL . Nor could the applicant succeed with her argument that she had not been sufficiently identified because ORG only used her surname . As also pointed out by ORG , as for proceedings concerning eviction it was also the situation for those on compulsory sale that only the owner of the part of ORG in question could be the addressee . It could not be assumed that any other intention lay behind the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG shared ORG view that a prior warning had not been a prerequisite for obliging her to sell her part . Since , in accordance with the findings below , the conditions of serious disturbance and nuisance had been fulfilled for obliging her to vacate the flat pursuant section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , the requisite of prior warning under section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW did not apply .", "CARDINAL . Like ORG , ORG found it established that the applicant \u2019s son , PERSON , for DATE had displayed conduct vis - \u00e0 - vis the household \u2019s neighbours constituting serious disturbance and nuisance to them . ORG judgments of DATE and DATE concerned several offences under ORG and PERSON of the Penal Code , all of which , but CARDINAL , had been aimed at neighbours in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The High Court further considered that the matters in respect of which Mr A had been charged and convicted did not give the full picture of the conduct that had prompted ORG to react with default measures in regard to the applicant . In this connection the High Court pointed to the findings made by ORG in its DATE judgment , which stated :", "\u201c Both from previous judgments and the statements given in this case , it emerged that the accused over DATE had repeatedly contacted a number of neighbours and other persons with whom he considered he was in conflict . He had repeatedly levelled new accusations and more or less veiled threats against these persons and had in part made very serious and degrading remarks and descriptions . His conduct beyond this had also been perceived as disturbing , frightening and wholly unreasonably intense , both in form , extent and frequency . For instance , amongst other things , at times he was positioning himself more or less in the background in order to suddenly ambush by getting very close to and to some extent hindering the passage of the person he was talking to , while raising his voice and using threating body language and mimicking . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG had further referred to the fact that Mr A in connection with a criminal case in DATE had undergone a thorough expert examination , which had inter alia concluded that he had extensive , systematic perceptions and experiences of conspiracy that were almost impossible to influence . Also the judgment of DATE had described acts and conduct by Mr A that clearly corresponded to that description .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that , during the period from CARDINAL DATE until DATE , Mr A had been imposed restraining orders prohibiting him from contacting altogether CARDINAL of his neighbours , the last such order having expired on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the High Court \u2019s assessment , the matters for which the applicant \u2019s son had been convicted constituted by their nature , their number and the extent of the period in which they had been committed DATE namely from QUANTITY DATE until DATE when seen as a whole , such default as fulfilled the conditions for requiring that the flat be vacated according to section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and the imposition of compulsory sale pursuant to section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . This conclusion was further strengthened by the information that the incidents ought to be considered as a pattern of behaviour that was capable of creating an atmosphere of insecurity in the near environment .", "CARDINAL . Having reached this conclusion , ORG found it unnecessary to examine whether Mr A \u2019s moving into the applicant \u2019s flat contrary to the declaration made on her behalf by Attorney B on DATE amounted to serious default in the sense of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Nor could the applicant succeed with her argument that the conditions had subsequently improved .", "CARDINAL . The High Court found that the conditions for the imposition of default measures under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL had in any event been fulfilled on DATE when the order of sale was sent to the applicant , which \u2013 as also held by ORG \u2013 was the decisive time for the assessment ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The argument that the applicant \u2019s high age should influence the assessment could not lead to any other conclusion . It was not difficult to see the sad side to hers having to move and , for that matter , even in the situation of her son . However , it was their own acts that had led to forcible sale of the apartment pursuant to section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , cf . section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . Thus , none of the grounds of appeal had succeeded and the High Court agreed with ORG that they ought to be considered to be \u201c clearly groundless \u201d ( section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . Her contention that ORG should not have determined the case without holding an oral hearing could not be upheld either .", "CARDINAL . Against this background ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against ORG decision . She pointed out that the proceedings threatened her right to housing and that it was a serious case especially in view of her advanced DATE . As regards the procedure , she submitted that the question was whether compulsory sale ought to occur under a written procedure or an ordinary procedure comprising an oral hearing . Her very considerable interest in keeping her apartment ought to be weighed against ORG limited interest in carrying out compulsory sale without an oral hearing . The competing interest in the case ought to have implications in the assessment of questions of procedure and the application of the law . ORG reasoning had been summary ; it had failed to deal with all her arguments and had omitted to comment on the interpretation of the terms \u201c clearly groundless \u201d and \u201c substantial default \u201d . The applicant requested ORG to quash ORG decision and to refer her case back to ORG for fresh examination under the ordinary procedure with an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts ankeutvalg ) , whose jurisdiction was limited to reviewing ORG procedure and interpretation of the law , rejected the appeal , finding it obvious that it could not succeed .", "CARDINAL . The assistant appointed to implement the compulsory sale , Attorney F. , subsequently advertised the applicant \u2019s apartment for sale . The highest bid was ORG CARDINAL ( currently corresponding to approximately EUR CARDINAL ) from PERSON On DATE Mr F. communicated the bid to ORG for validation ( stadfestelse ) , following which all interested parties were given DATE for expressing objections . Before the expiry of the time - limit , the applicant and Mr A objected to the sale .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE the relevant section of ORG ( byfogdembete ) validated the above - mentioned bid .", "DATE . On DATE ORG rejected an appeal by the applicant and her son against ORG decision to validate the bid , as did ORG on DATE finding it obvious that the appeal could not succeed .", "CARDINAL . In conjunction with the above proceedings , the applicant and/or Mr A unsuccessfully pursued multiple other matters regarding the sale of the applicant \u2019s apartment ( request for replacement housing ; miscellaneous complaints regarding the office of the Execution and Enforcement Commissioner \u2019s ( namsmannen ) handling of the sale ; a demand of access to documents in the possession of OBOS ; disqualification of all police officers employed at ORG ; Mr A \u2019s compensation claim against the ORG on account of the police having communicated information about him to OBOS allegedly in breach of their duty of confidentiality ; his compensation claim against OBOS for its manner of processing information pertaining to him ; his demand that OBOS remove from its archives and destroy a police report related to him ; and his request for access to a file in OBOS \u2019s possession ) as well as a request for the joinder of these proceedings and an oral hearing . All these claims were rejected as being groundless by the relevant sections of ORG ( DATE and DATE ) , ORG ( CARDINAL and DATE ) and ORG ( DATE ) . On DATE the applicant was notified that the new owner had demanded that the applicant vacate the apartment following the implementation of compulsory sale .", "CARDINAL .
