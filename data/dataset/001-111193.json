NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and , as far as the ORG is aware , now lives in GPE . He was represented by Mr C.A. Madern , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agents , Mr R.A.A. PERSON and Ms J. Schukking , and their Deputy Agent , Ms L. GPE , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG , informed by the Registrar of their right under LAW to take part in the proceedings , did not elect to do so .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant first came to GPE in DATE . He had been issued a visa , valid for DATE , enabling him to visit relatives . It is not clear how long he stayed in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant married PERSON , a NORP national , in GPE . The couple subsequently returned to the GPE , apparently without a visa , where they resided illegally . A son , PERSON , was born to them on DATE . They lived together as a family for DATE before the spouses separated in DATE . The applicant had access to his son and would meet with him at his brother \u2019s house . Divorce proceedings in GPE were started in DATE , resulting in the divorce being pronounced on DATE . PERSON was given parental authority over PERSON , with the applicant being granted access to his son every first Sunday of the month and every first day of national and religious holidays .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , in DATE , the applicant had returned to GPE to do his military service . DATE , PERSON visited GPE during holidays , staying for a while with the applicant \u2019s parents as well as with the applicant himself . In DATE the applicant returned to the GPE on a short - stay visa to visit relatives , but he overstayed . He saw his son a few times at his brother \u2019s house . The applicant states that PERSON thwarted the access arrangement as much as possible .", "CARDINAL . Ms \u00d6. was granted a residence permit on an unknown date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the juvenile judge ( kinderrechter ) of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) issued a supervision order ( ondertoezichtstelling ) , valid for DATE , in respect of the applicant \u2019s son PERSON and the latter \u2019s half - sister ( a child born of a previous relationship of the applicant \u2019s ex - wife ) . This decision resulted from an investigation carried out by ORG ( PERSON ) , which had found that PERSON and his CARDINAL - sister were being ill - treated , that their mother had limited pedagogical abilities and that she would often leave the children on their own . ORG Bureau Jeugdzorg ) was appointed as the family - supervision institution ( gezinsvoogdij - instelling ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for a residence permit on the basis of a temporary regulation on the legalisation of illegal aliens who had been residing in the GPE for a long period of time ( PERSON regeling witte illegalen ) . He indicated that he had regular contacts with his son , which it would be practically impossible to maintain from GPE , and that there thus existed compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature militating in favour of the grant of a residence permit . As the legalisation regulation only applied to requests which had been lodged DATE and DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request on DATE . The Deputy Minister further considered that there were no indications that the applicant ought to be allowed to reside in the GPE for reasons of a humanitarian nature .", "CARDINAL . In a report of DATE compiled by ORG and enclosed with their request to the juvenile judge for an extension of the supervision order , the applicant is mentioned as being PERSON \u2019s biological father who is residing illegally in the GPE at an unknown address . On DATE the supervision order was extended for DATE . In addition , on DATE the juvenile judge ordered PERSON and his CARDINAL - sister urgently to be taken into care ( spoeduithuisplaatsing ) as it had been found that they were suffering serious neglect and abuse at home . They were accommodated in a foster home . This measure was confirmed on DATE and prolonged until DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , in his objection ( bezwaar ) of DATE against the decision refusing him a residence permit , supplemented by an additional document dated DATE , the applicant argued , inter alia , that his ex - wife was unable to look after their son by herself so that it was in PERSON \u2019s interests that the applicant also assist in his upbringing DATE and , therefore , that the applicant reside in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the Deputy Minister dismissed the objection , finding that LAW did not impose a positive obligation on the GPE to grant the applicant a residence permit . In this context the Deputy Minister considered that the applicant had not substantiated his claim that his ex - wife was unable to bring up their son by herself . Moreover , it had not appeared that any impediment existed to the exercise of family life abroad .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed this decision to ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE , and also applied to that court for an injunction in order to stay his expulsion .", "CARDINAL . In a report evaluating the course of the supervision order , drawn up by ORG and submitted with a request by that ORG of DATE for an extension of the order , it is stated that the applicant had expressed the wish to see his son more often . Neither PERSON nor PERSON was very taken with that idea . An access arrangement had nevertheless been agreed , but this did not appear to work in practice .", "CARDINAL . NORP In additional grounds of CARDINAL DATE for his appeal to ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE , in the aliens - law proceedings , the applicant argued that an investigation was being carried out into the question whether it would be better for PERSON if his father were made responsible for his care and upbringing . The applicant claimed that he was willing and able to do so , and that he had even applied for an amendment of the parental authority situation . The applicant further submitted that his son would have no possibility of maintaining the relationship with his father if the latter was not in the GPE . In that case , PERSON would have to stay with his mother or , as had been suggested by the family supervisor ( gezinsvoogd ) , be placed away from his mother and be accommodated in a foster family .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE before the juvenile judge concerning the request for an extension of the supervision order relating to PERSON , the applicant stated that at the previous hearing the judge had said that it should be investigated whether or not it would be better for PERSON to live with his father , but no such investigation had taken place . An investigation into the feasibility of an access arrangement , also ordered , had not taken place either . The applicant announced that a change in the parental authority situation would be sought if the family supervisor failed to carry out the investigation into the possibility of PERSON living with him . At the hearing the family supervisor admitted that he had not yet done much about the request for an access arrangement as he had been concentrating on the situation of PERSON \u2019s CARDINAL - sister .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the juvenile judge extended the supervision order and also ordered the starting - up of an access arrangement and an investigation into the possibility of PERSON living with his father .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently informed ORG , where his appeal was pending in the proceedings relating to his request for a residence permit , that the juvenile judge had instructed ORG to investigate whether he should be invested with parental authority over his son and whether his son should live with him .", "CARDINAL . The hearing in these appeal proceedings took place before ORG on DATE . The applicant submitted inter alia that an investigation , ordered by the GPE juvenile judge , was currently pending into the question whether PERSON should be brought up by his father and whether parental authority over PERSON ought to be awarded to him . Furthermore , it was plain to see that there were obstacles to the applicant developing family life with his son in GPE : there was a supervision order in place , issued by a GPE court , and parental authority still remained with PERSON \u2019s mother \u2013 the applicant was thus not free to take his son with him .", "CARDINAL . Since ORG had still not carried out the investigation ordered by the juvenile judge , the applicant submitted a petition to ORG on DATE in which he requested to be granted sole parental authority over PERSON and to be entrusted with PERSON \u2019s upbringing . The applicant argued that PERSON had indicated that he wanted to see his father more often and even wanted to live with him , but that his mother did not agree to this .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal as well as the request for an injunction in the proceedings relating to the applicant \u2019s request for a residence permit . It considered that the Deputy Secretary had been correct in attaching greater weight to the interests of the community as a whole than to those of the individual . In this context ORG took into account that the applicant had only submitted a decision of the juvenile judge extending the supervision order , but no documents showing that he had lodged a request for parental authority . The applicant had furthermore not submitted proof of the existence of an access arrangement ; it was unclear where the child was staying ; and the applicant had not demonstrated that there were any objective impediments to family life between himself and his son being pursued in a different manner . ORG noted that the applicant could keep in contact with his son by telephone or letters . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG subsequently decided that , for the time being at least , it would not be in PERSON \u2019s best interests for him to go and live with his father . Although PERSON \u2019s situation with his mother was not ideal , it was not so alarming that he urgently required to be placed away from her . In addition , a placement with his father DATE to which neither PERSON nor his mother consented \u2013would confront PERSON with a serious conflict of loyalties . For those reasons , ORG did not consider it opportune to examine the applicant \u2019s situation . ORG informed the applicant of its position on DATE . It had further agreed with PERSON that he would see his father every first Sunday of the month .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request to be awarded sole parental authority . The court agreed with ORG that at the present time it was not in PERSON \u2019s best interests for the applicant to be invested with parental authority . The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision , submitting that the supervision order had been in place for DATE without PERSON \u2019s situation having undergone any real improvement .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant left the GPE in DATE and , as far as the ORG is aware , has resided in GPE ever since .", "CARDINAL . Following a hearing on DATE , ORG ( gerechtshof ) ordered ORG to investigate , before DATE , the applicant \u2019s background and the possibility of parental authority being granted to him .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG rejected the appeal . It had regard to the report issued by ORG on DATE , from which it appeared that the applicant had not been involved in the ORG \u2019s investigation as he was residing in GPE and was unable to come to the GPE due to the fact that his visa applications kept being refused . ORG had , however , contacted a brother of the applicant \u2019s and the former \u2019s spouse , according to whom PERSON had had irregular contacts with his father in DATE . ORG noted that , if parental authority was awarded to the applicant , this would mean that PERSON , who had been born and bred in the GPE , who did not speak NORP and who did not want to go to GPE , would have to move to GPE at DATE . ORG considered that this would not be in PERSON \u2019s best interests , even though it was true that the situation in which he was being raised had not been ideal in DATE . ORG agreed with the ORG \u2019s assessment , adding that it had not been made clear in what way the applicant would wish to exercise his parental authority . While it understood the applicant \u2019s concerns , the court also took into account that PERSON \u2019s health and performance at school had in the meantime improved and that the supervision order was also expected to have a positive effect .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not lodge an appeal on points of law with ORG ( PERSON ) against this decision .", "CARDINAL .
