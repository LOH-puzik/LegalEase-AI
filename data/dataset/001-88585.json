GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALV and ORG and PERSON v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALV ) . It found that while domestic law now recognised that there was a duty of care in relation to children , whose best interests were always paramount , there was a potential conflict of interest between the child and the parents , as it would always be in the GPE best interests for the child not to be removed . Where consideration was being given to whether child abuse justified measures , a duty of care could be owed to the child but not to the parents . It upheld the rulings of the various ORG judges as a result .", "CARDINAL . After a hearing on DATE and CARDINAL and DATE , ORG gave judgment on DATE . They affirmed the orders made by the first - instance judges and ORG . Lord PERSON , in his judgment with which the majority agreed , found inter alia :", "\" DATE . There are CARDINAL cardinal features in these cases . CARDINAL feature is that a parent was suspected of having deliberately harmed his or her own child or having fabricated the child \u2019s medical condition . The other feature , which is to be assumed , is that the ensuing investigation by the doctors was conducted negligently . In consequence , the suspected parent \u2019s life was disrupted , to a greater or lesser extent , and the suspected parent suffered psychiatric injury .", "CARDINAL . It is the combination of these features which creates the difficult problem now before the ORG . In the ordinary course the interests of parent and child are congruent . This is not so where a parent wilfully harms his child . Then the parent is knowingly acting directly contrary to his parental responsibilities and to the best interests of his child . So the liability of doctors and social workers in these cases calls into consideration CARDINAL countervailing interests , each of high social importance : the need to safeguard children from abuse by their own parents , and the need to protect parents from unnecessary interference with their family life .", "CARDINAL . The first of these interests involves protection of children as the victims of crime . Child abuse is criminal conduct of a particularly reprehensible character : children are highly vulnerable members of society . Child abuse is also a form of criminal conduct peculiarly hard to combat , because its existence is difficult to discover . Babies and young children are unable to complain , older children too frightened . If the source of the abuse is the parent , the child is at risk from his primary and natural protector within the privacy of his home . This both increases the risk of abuse and means that investigation necessitates intrusion into highly sensitive areas of family life , with the added complication that the parent who is responsible for the abuse will give a false account of the child \u2019s history .", "CARDINAL . The other , countervailing interest is the deep interest of the parent in his or her family life . ... Interference with family life requires cogent justification , for the sake of children and parents alike . So public authorities , should , so far as possible , cooperate with the parents when making decisions about their children . Public authorities should disclose matters relied upon by them as justifying interference with family life . Parents should be involved in the decision - making process to whatever extent is appropriate to protect their interests adequately .", "CARDINAL . The question raised by these appeals is how these countervailing interests are best balanced when a parent is wrongly suspected of having abused his child . Public confidence in the child protection system can only be maintained if a proper balance is struck , avoiding unnecessary intrusion in families while protecting children at risk of significant harm ... Clearly health professionals must act in good faith . They must not act recklessly , that is without caring whether an allegation of abuse is well - founded or not . Acting recklessly is not acting in good faith . But are health professionals liable to the suspected parents if they fall short of the standard of skill and care expected of any reasonable professional in the circumstances ? Are they exposed to claims by the parents for professional negligence ? ...", "CARDINAL . In considering these questions the starting point is to note that in each of these CARDINAL cases ... the doctors acted properly in considering whether the claimant parents had deliberately inflicted injury on the child in question . The doctors were entitled , indeed bound to consider this possibility . Further , having become suspicious , the doctors rightly communicated their suspicions to the statutory services responsible for child protection . That is the essential next step in child protection ...", "DATE . In each case the suspected parent was eventually cleared of suspicion . In CARDINAL case this was after DATE , in the other cases after much longer periods . The second point to note is that , essentially , the GPE complaints related to the periods for which they remained under suspicion . In each case the parent \u2019s complaint concerns the conduct of the clinical investigation during these periods ; the investigation , it is said , was unnecessarily protracted . The doctors failed to carry out the necessary tests with appropriate expedition . Had due care and skill been realised from the outset , the ORG suspicions would have been allayed at once or much more speedily than occurred , and , in consequence , the parents would have been spared the trauma to which they were subjected . Thus the essence of the claims is that the health professionals responsible for protecting a suspected child victim owe a person suspected of having committed a crime against the child a duty to investigate their suspicions , a duty sounding in damages if they act in good faith but carelessly .", "CARDINAL . Stated in this broad form , this is a surprising proposition . In this area of the law , concerned with the reporting and investigation of suspected crime , the balancing point between the public interest and the interest of a suspected individual has long been the presence or absence of good faith ...", "DATE . This background accords ill with the submission that those responsible for the protection of a child against criminal conduct owe suspected perpetrators the duty suggested . The existence of such a duty would fundamentally alter the balance in this area of the law . It would mean that if a parent suspected that a babysitter or a teacher at a nursery or school might have been responsible for abusing her child , the doctor would owe a duty of care to the suspect ...", "CARDINAL ... < Counsel > did not contend for such a broad proposition ... His submission was more restricted .... That the health professionals\u2019 duty to exercise due professional skill and care is owed only to the child \u2019s primary carers , usually the parents , as well as the child himself . ...", "CARDINAL . My initial difficulty ... is that the distinction between primary carers , to whom the duty would be owed , and other suspects to whom it would not , is not altogether convincing . It is difficult to see why , if a health professional owes no duty to a childminder or teacher suspected of abuse , he should nonetheless owe such a duty to a parent suspected of abuse . An erroneous suspicion that a childminder or school teacher had been abusing a child in his or her care can be very damaging to him or her . ...", "CARDINAL . There is , however , CARDINAL major difference between parents and childminders or school teachers , . In the case of a parent suspicion may disrupt the parent \u2019s family life . ... So the crucial question ... is whether this potential disruption of family life tilts the balance in favour of imposing liability in negligence where abuse by a parent is erroneously suspected ...", "...", "CARDINAL . In my view the Court of Appeal reached the right conclusion on the issue ... Ultimately the factor which persuaded me that , at common law , interference with family life does not justify according a suspected parent a higher level of protection than other suspected perpetrators is the factor conveniently labelled \u2018 conflict of interest\u2019 . A doctor is obliged to act in the best interests of his patient . In these cases the child is his patient . The doctor is charged with the protection of the child , not with the protection of the parent . The best interests of a child and his parent normally march hand - in - hand . But when considering whether something does not feel \u2018 quite right\u2019 , a doctor must be able to act single - mindedly in the interests of the child . He ought not have to have at the back of his mind an awareness that if his doubts about intentional injury or sexual abuse prove unfounded he may be exposed to claims by a distressed parent .", "CARDINAL . ... the seriousness of child abuse as a social problem demands that health professionals , acting in good faith in what they believe are the best interests of the child , should not be subject to potentially conflicting duties when deciding whether a child may have been abused , or when deciding whether their doubts should be communicated to others , or when deciding what further investigatory or protective steps should be taken . The duty to the child in making these decisions should not be clouded by imposing a conflicting duty in favour of parents or others suspected of having abused the child . ... \""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
