In the version of the text that was in force until DATE , it stipulated in particular that only laboratories that were run by doctors , pharmacists or persons qualified in chemical sciences were entitled to carry out clinical tests that were eligible for reimbursement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge concluded the preparation of the case . On DATE the ORG finalised his written submissions and , on CARDINAL DATE , ORG made an order committing the applicants ( and CARDINAL other defendants ) to stand trial before ORG , sitting as a criminal court .", "The fraudulent intent referred to in the committal submissions for offences classified as acts of \u201c forgery \u201d consisted in the fact of deceiving the authorities \u201c responsible for monitoring implementation of the legislation on the operation of medical laboratories , in particular the provisions of LAW no . CARDINAL \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The oral proceedings began on DATE and were spread over DATE hearings .", "CARDINAL . A number of mutual insurance companies applied to join the proceedings as civil parties . They sought compensation for damage stemming from CARDINAL causes . They claimed that the applicants had , firstly , engaged in a practice of fee sharing and , secondly , had run a clinical biology laboratory in breach of the provisions of LAW no . CARDINAL . Under the second head they claimed CARDINAL , corresponding to the total amount paid to the Biorim laboratory DATE ( date on which LAW no .

On DATE the criminal court convicted the applicants , imposing prison sentences and fines , for various offences that had been committed in connection with the management of Biorim .

Before ORG , the applicants argued in particular that LAW no . CARDINAL was incompatible with DATE of LAW establishing ORG , taken together with ORG CARDINAL ( prohibition of the abuse of a dominant position ) and CARDINAL ( freedom of establishment ) of the LAW and that it should be declared inapplicable on account of the direct effect and primacy of Community law . They requested in this connection that the question be referred to ORG of ORG for a preliminary ruling .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG , after examining the above - mentioned argument on the merits , found that LAW no . CARDINAL was compatible with Community law . It emphasised , in particular , that \u201c national measures capable of hindering or rendering less attractive the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by LAW \u201d had to fulfil CARDINAL conditions and that the measure in question did so , being non - discriminatory , justified by compelling reasons in the general interest , appropriate to ensure the fulfilment of the aim pursued , and not going beyond what was necessary to that end .", "ORG then decided \u201c that there [ was ] no need to refer questions for a preliminary ruling \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

As to the requests of the civil parties , ORG declared them inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . Ruling on appeals by the applicants and the civil parties , ORG , in a judgment of DATE , dismissed the appeals in so far as they were directed against the criminal provisions of the judgment of DATE , finding in particular that there was no need to refer questions to ORG of ORG . It quashed the judgment , however , in respect of its findings on the civil actions and , within that limit , referred the case back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant had lodged a complaint against GPE with ORG , arguing that LAW no . CARDINAL was incompatible with the LAW establishing ORG .", "In DATE ORG initiated the infringement procedure provided for in LAW establishing ORG and requested the NORP authorities to submit their observations on the compatibility of LAW no . CARDINAL with LAW , concerning freedom of establishment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a reasoned opinion finding that LAW was incompatible with LAW . It requested GPE to amend that provision , which had the effect of placing non - NORP operators wishing to run clinical biology laboratories in GPE and establish themselves there at a disadvantage in relation to certain NORP professionals ( in particular doctors , pharmacists or persons qualified in chemical sciences ) . In the ORG \u2019s opinion , the fact that only those laboratories which fulfilled the prescribed conditions could provide services eligible for reimbursement through the health insurance system discouraged beneficiaries of that insurance from going to other laboratories and thus restricted the effectiveness of the freedom of establishment , in breach of LAW establishing ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE enacted a law amending LAW no . CARDINAL , abolishing the requirement to have particular qualifications to operate a laboratory carrying out clinical tests eligible for reimbursement under the sickness and invalidity insurance scheme .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parties wrote to the office of the public prosecutor at ORG seeking the organisation of a preparatory hearing . It took place DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The debate concerning the reimbursement of clinical tests focussed on the question of the compatibility with Community law of LAW no . CARDINAL . In the applicants\u2019 submission , that provision was in breach of certain rules of the LAW establishing ORG , in particular those concerning freedom of establishment ( LAW ) , the free movement of capital ( LAW ) , the free provision of services ( LAW and the rules on free competition ( Articles CARDINAL and DATE ) . Referring in particular to ORG opinion of DATE ( see above ) , they concluded that LAW no . CARDINAL could not have produced ab initio any legal effect and that , being bound by the primacy of Community law , ORG could not take account of the convictions handed down , not even considering the offences as mere torts . In the alternative , the second applicant requested that a question be referred to ORG of ORG for a preliminary ruling on the conformity of LAW no . CARDINAL with the provisions of Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW establishing ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 arguments . It emphasised that ORG reasoned opinion of DATE was not binding and that ORG judgment of DATE , of which the criminal provisions had the authority of res judicata , had found LAW no . CARDINAL to be compatible with Community law . Further noting that ORG , in its decision of DATE , had decided that there was no need to refer preliminary questions to ORG of ORG , it reached the same conclusion , on the ground that such questions were not \u201c indispensable for adjudication \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Upholding the civil claims , ORG ordered the applicants to pay various amounts to the civil parties , including CARDINAL mutual insurance companies jointly , for a total of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed on points of law against the judgment of DATE . They reiterated in particular the argument that LAW no . CARDINAL was incompatible with the LAW establishing ORG , a higher source of law . They further submitted that , whilst ORG itself had not found the provisions incompatible , it had a duty , under LAW establishing ORG , to refer the matter to ORG of ORG for a preliminary ruling on the issue ofprinciple of the authority of res judicata and the primacy of Community law . In their submission , the fact that ORG had upheld the authority of res judicata in ORG judgment , whereas developments following that decision had revealed it to be erroneous , constituted a breach of the right to a fair hearing LAW and more specifically the entitlement to a hearing by an impartial tribunal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeals . It reiterated among other things the principle that the authority of res judicata in criminal matters precluded the court hearing any subsequent civil claims from calling into question what had been adjudicated with final effect , certainty and necessity as to the existence of a fact forming the common basis of the criminal proceedings and the civil suit . It concluded that ORG had rightly held that the finding of ORG of DATE concerning the conformity of LAW no . CARDINAL with Community law had been correct , being in line with that principle .", "ORG , moreover , considered that the question whether the principle of the primacy of Community law should take precedence over that of the authority of res judicata had already been settled by ORG of ORG in its judgments in ORG and ORG ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of DATE and PERSON v. ORG GmbH ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of DATE . It noted in this connection that ORG had concluded in those judgments that the second principle prevailed , finding that \u201c Community law [ did ] not require a national court to disapply domestic rules of procedure conferring finality on a decision , even if to do so would enable it to remedy an infringement of Community law by the decision at issue \u201d , and had explained in the ORG judgment that \u201c the obligation of the body concerned to review a final decision , which would appear to have been adopted in breach of ORG law [ was ] subject , in accordance with LAW ORG , to the condition , inter alia , that that body should be empowered under national law to reopen that decision \u201d . ORG concluded that \u201c there [ was ] no need to submit once again to ORG of ORG the point of law that it [ had ] thus resolved , regardless of the nature of the proceedings which [ had given ] rise to its case - law and despite the questions at issue not strictly being the same \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG issued a decision suspending the laboratory \u2019s accreditation for a DATE period . Referring to ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the decision was based on a failure to comply with LAW no . CARDINAL .", "The company Biorim unsuccessfully lodged an administrative appeal : the suspension was confirmed by a ministerial decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , a fresh ministerial decision had extended the suspension of accreditation for a DATE period \u201c on account of the continuing infringements of LAW no . CARDINAL \u201d .", "In a decision of DATE the Minister dismissed the administrative appeal lodged by ORG and confirmed the suspension , on the ground that the company had not put an end to the situation which had justified the first suspension of accreditation , the applicant having continued to run the laboratory .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL September CARDINAL Biorim applied to the ORG d\u2019Etat for the annulment of the ministerial decisions of CARDINAL DATE ( G / A CARDINAL.CARDINAL/VI-CARDINAL.CARDINAL ; the \u201c first set of proceedings \u201d ) and of DATE ( G / A CARDINAL ; the \u201c second set of proceedings \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was a third - party intervener in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The company Biorim and the applicant claimed in particular that LAW no . CARDINAL , on which the impugned decisions had been based , was in breach of Articles CARDINAL ( freedom of establishment ) , DATE ( free provision of services ) and CARDINAL ( free movement of capital ) of the LAW establishing ORG , and of Article CARDINAL taken together with ORG CARDINAL ( prohibition of abuse of dominant position ) , CARDINAL , DATE or DATE . They concluded that those decisions were devoid of admissible basis and should therefore be annulled .", "In the alternative , the applicant requested the PERSON d\u2019Etat to refer questions to ORG of ORG for a preliminary ruling to determine whether the above - mentioned ORG of the LAW establishing ORG were to be interpreted as precluding the application of legislation imposing the various restrictions provided for in LAW no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In his report of DATE , the Auditeur ( legal assistant at the PERSON d\u2019Etat ) declared the argument well - founded and took the view that the impugned decisions should be annulled on the ground that LAW no . CARDINAL was not in conformity with Community law .", "The PERSON observed first of all that the NORP courts had to refuse to give effect to any provisions of domestic law that ran counter to provisions of international law having direct effect . This was the case for national legislation concerning the services of medical laboratories , which had to be compatible with the rules of Community law on freedom of establishment and the free provision of services , since ORG of ORG had held that those rules applied to such services ( ORG , DATE , C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . He added that it was invalid in the present case to argue that the legislation bore no relation to trade between CARDINAL ORG member GPE \u2013 especially as , in his opinion , factors of such nature were present \u2013 as justification for finding the provisions inapplicable , referring in this connection to the case - law of the GPE court to the effect that since the fundamental freedoms enshrined in Community law extended in their application to the potential effects of legislation , they could not be considered inapplicable simply because the facts of the specific case were confined to a single member ORG ( ORG , C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL to C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . He went on to observe that \u201c national measures capable of hindering or rendering less attractive the exercise of such fundamental freedoms \u201d were admissible only under certain conditions , in particular where they did not go beyond what was necessary to achieve the aim pursued . In the present case , firstly , LAW no . CARDINAL hindered and rendered less attractive the freedom of establishment , the free provision of services and the free movement of capital as regards the operation of clinical biology laboratories ; secondly , the measure implemented was disproportionate to the aim pursued DATE to avoid over - consumption of clinical biology services \u2013 as that aim could be achieved by means that were less restrictive of freedoms .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL judgments of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat dismissed the submission that there had been a violation of the above - mentioned ORG of the LAW establishing ORG .", "It first observed that , under LAW , \u201c [ i]n the case of public undertakings and undertakings to which member States grant[ed ] special or exclusive rights , member GPE [ could ] neither enact nor maintain in force any measure contrary to the rules contained in that LAW , in particular to the rules provided for in LAW to CARDINAL \u201d . Finding that the laboratories referred to in LAW no . CARDINAL did not fall within those categories , it declared DATE of LAW inapplicable in the present case .", "As to the other provisions of the LAW relied upon in the submission , the PERSON d\u2019Etat referred to the case - law of ORG of ORG to the effect that the LAW \u2019s rules in matters of free circulation of persons and services did not affect any restrictions applying to nationals of a member ORG on the territory of that ORG where the situation in which they found themselves had no link to any of the situations envisaged by Community law . According to the ORG d\u2019Etat , the dispute did not , in the present case , contain any extraneous elements capable of justifying the application of Community law . In that connection it explained as follows :", "\u201c ... [ Biorim ] is a company incorporated under NORP law and operating in GPE . As it operates within the NORP market , it has not availed itself of the freedom of establishment or the free provision of services provided for respectively by ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW establishing ORG . The alleged circumstance ... that Community nationals established in other member GPE could make use of the services of [ Biorim ] does not constitute , in respect of the company , a link to Community law within the meaning of the above - cited case - law of ORG of ORG .", "[ The applicant ] is NORP and in order to run the laboratory of [ Biorim ] he did not make use of freedom of movement within ORG . Although it has been shown in the criminal - court decisions that he used \u201c financing packages \u201d , in particular through the intermediary of the GPE company [ T. ] , this factor has no bearing on the grounds for the impugned decision . The case against [ Biorim ] is not that it was operated by that company , or that it was financed by foreign capital , but precisely that it was run by [ the applicant ] , whereas he did not have CARDINAL of the qualifications required to do so , as shown by the criminal - court decisions . The [ applicant \u2019s ] situation in this connection is confined exclusively to the national sphere ... \u201d", "The PERSON d\u2019Etat further refused to refer the applicant \u2019s questions to ORG of ORG for a preliminary ruling , observing as follows :", "\u201c ... LAW does not oblige courts or tribunals against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law to refer a question concerning the interpretation of Community law raised before them if that question is not relevant , that is to say , if the answer to that question , regardless of what it may be , can in no way affect the outcome of the case . The same applies when the question raised is materially identical with a question which has already been the subject of a preliminary ruling in a similar case , where previous decisions of the ORG have already dealt with the point of law in question , even though the questions at issue are not strictly identical , or where the correct application of Community law is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt as to the manner in which the question raised is to be resolved ... In the present case , there is no reasonable doubt as to the inapplicability of LAW establishing ORG to the laboratories referred to in LAW no . CARDINAL .... In addition , for the reasons given , an answer by the ORG as to the interpretation of ORG CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW establishing ORG could not affect the outcome of the present dispute ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The company Biorim additionally argued , inter alia , that there had been a breach of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW concerning equality before the law and the prohibition of discrimination .", "The PERSON d\u2019Etat held that , in so far as Biorim was complaining of a difference in treatment between NORP nationals established in GPE and those established in other member GPE or nationals of other member GPE , on the ground that the latter categories enjoyed more rights and guarantees in the context of the application of LAW no . CARDINAL , this was a new submission raised only in its rejoinder and was thus belated and inadmissible .", "In response to Biorim \u2019s argument that , by reserving the intervention of the sickness insurance scheme to laboratories run by doctors , pharmacists or persons qualified in chemical sciences , LAW no . CARDINAL introduced , between those persons and other business operators , a prohibited difference in treatment , the ORG d\u2019Etat found that its decision should be reserved in order to submit a question on that subject to ORG for a preliminary ruling . ORG responded by a judgment of DATE that the said provision did not breach ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . In addition , in the context of the second set of proceedings , the PERSON d\u2019Etat partly re - opened the case , requesting the Auditeur to pursue the investigation and produce a supplementary report on arguments other than those alleging a breach of Community law .", "The Auditeur found that the ministerial decision of DATE should be annulled on grounds related to the reasoning of the impugned decision , being unconnected to the complaints submitted by the applicant to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON d\u2019Etat dismissed the applications by CARDINAL judgments of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW establishing ORG ( former LAW and , since DATE , Article CARDINAL of the LAW on the Functioning of ORG ) provides for preliminary rulings of ORG of ORG as follows :", "\u201c ORG shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning :", "( a ) the interpretation of this LAW ;", "( b ) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions of the Community ... ;", "...", "Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a Member ORG , that court or tribunal may , if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment , request ORG to give a ruling thereon .", "Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member ORG against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law , that court or tribunal shall bring the matter before ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of ORG . ORG and ORG . v. ORG ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG . DATE , p. CARDINAL ) ORG of ORG had received a request from ORG for a ruling as to whether the third paragraph of LAW establishing ORG ( former LAW ) laid down an obligation to refer a matter which precluded the national court from determining whether the question raised was justified or whether it made that obligation conditional on the prior finding of a reasonable interpretative doubt .", "In its judgment ORG explained , firstly , as follows :", "\u201c ... CARDINAL . The second paragraph of that article [ Article CARDINAL ] provides that any court or tribunal of a Member ORG may , if it considers that a decision on a question of interpretation is necessary to enable it to give judgment , request ORG to give a ruling thereon . The third paragraph of that article provides that , where a question of interpretation is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member ORG against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law , that court or tribunal shall , bring the matter before ORG .", "CARDINAL . That obligation to refer a matter to ORG is based on cooperation , established with a view to ensuring the proper application and uniform interpretation of Community law in all the Member States , between national courts , in their capacity as courts responsible for the application of Community law , and ORG . More particularly , the third paragraph of Article [ CARDINAL ] seeks to prevent the occurrence within ORG in judicial decisions on questions of Community law . The scope of that obligation must therefore be assessed , in view of those objectives , by reference to the powers of the national courts , on the one hand , and those of ORG , on the other , where such a question of interpretation is raised within the meaning of Article [ CARDINAL ] .", "CARDINAL . In this connection , it is necessary to define the meaning for the purposes of Community law of the expression \u201c where any such question is raised \u201d in order to determine the circumstances in which a national court or tribunal against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law is obliged to bring a matter before ORG .", "CARDINAL . In this regard , it must in the first place be pointed out that Article [ CARDINAL ] does not constitute a means of redress available to the parties to a case pending before a national court or tribunal . Therefore the mere fact that a party contends that the dispute gives rise to a question concerning the interpretation of Community law does not mean that the court or tribunal concerned is compelled to consider that a question has been raised within the meaning of Article CARDINAL . ... \u201d", "ORG went on to observe that courts or tribunals against whose decisions there was no judicial remedy had the same discretion as any other national court or tribunal to ascertain \u201c whether a decision on a question of Community law [ was ] necessary to enable them to give judgment \u201d . It concluded that they were not obliged to refer a question of interpretation of Community law raised before them in the following situations : ( CARDINAL ) where the question was not relevant , in the sense that the answer to the question , regardless of what it might be , could in no way affect the outcome of the case ; ( CARDINAL ) where the question was materially identical with question which had already been the subject of a preliminary ruling in a similar case , or where previous decisions of the ORG had already dealt with the point of law in question , irrespective of the nature of the proceedings which led to those decisions , even though the questions at issue were not strictly identical ; or ( CARDINAL ) where the correct application of Community law was so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt as to the manner in which the question raised was to be resolved ( bearing in mind that before it came to this conclusion the national court or tribunal had to be convinced that the matter was equally obvious to the courts of the other member GPE and to ORG , and only if those conditions were satisfied could the national court or tribunal refrain from submitting the question to ORG and take upon itself the responsibility for resolving it ) .", "The judgment then concluded as follows ( point CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c ... the third paragraph of Article [ CARDINAL ] of the ORG treaty is to be interpreted as meaning that a court or tribunal against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law is required , where a question of Community law is raised before it , to comply with its obligation to bring the matter before ORG , unless it has established that the question raised is irrelevant or that the Community provision in question has already been interpreted by the ORG or that the correct application of Community law is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt . The existence of such a possibility must be assessed in the light of the specific characteristics of Community law , the particular difficulties to which its interpretation gives rise and the risk of divergences in judicial decisions within the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
