{"ITEMID": "001-4979", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "AUT", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 1999, "DOCNAME": "TEWS v. AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP national , born in DATE and residing in GPE . He is a lawyer by profession .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "ORG for reduction of maintenance payments", "On DATE ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) dissolved the applicant \u2019s marriage . The ORG based its decision on an agreement which the applicant and his wife had concluded DATE in court providing , inter alia , for maintenance payments by the applicant to his CARDINAL children .", "On DATE the applicant remarried and subsequently adopted the child of his present wife .", "On DATE the applicant introduced a request with ORG for reduction of maintenance payments and referred to his new obligation to maintain his present wife and child .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the request . On DATE the applicant appealed . On CARDINAL DATE ORG nevertheless appointed a book - keeping expert to assess the applicant \u2019s income . On DATE the applicant also appealed against this decision . On DATE the ORG heard the parties at the applicant \u2019s request on the appointment of the expert .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) quashed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and upheld ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE to appoint a book - keeping expert . As regards the decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG noted that the issue of the reduction of maintenance payments was closely connected with the provisions in the agreement of DATE for the recalculation of maintenance payments . ORG ( Vormundschaftsgericht ) had refused to approve part of the agreement but had failed to decide whether it also disapproved of some remaining provisions relevant to the issue . ORG should therefore have only decided on the applicant \u2019s request once this issue had been clarified .", "On DATE ORG found that there was no need to approve the remaining parts of the agreement of DATE . The applicant appealed against this decision . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision .", "On DATE ORG decided not to give its approval to the remaining part of the agreement of DATE . It found that it was not in the interests of the children to grant them maintenance payments at a fixed percentage of the applicant \u2019s income . Such a method would not take into account any increasing needs of the children . The applicant appealed against this decision .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal but granted an ordinary appeal on points of law ( ordentlicher Revisionsrekurs ) as it considered that there existed no case - law on partial approval of maintenance agreements concluded in the course of divorce proceedings .", "On DATE the applicant introduced the appeal on points of law , which was dismissed on DATE by ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) .", "On DATE the applicant applied for a time - limit to be fixed for the seeking of the expert opinion . On DATE the court file was transmitted to the appointed expert , who submitted his expert opinion to ORG on DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for reduction of maintenance payments . The applicant appealed and also challenged the court clerk ( GPE ) for bias .", "On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision of DATE . On DATE the President of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s challenge for bias .", "On DATE ORG again dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for reduction of maintenance payments . The applicant appealed .", "On DATE the applicant again challenged the court clerk dealing with his case for bias , as well as the President of ORG who on DATE had rejected the applicant \u2019s previous challenge .", "On DATE ORG decided the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . It partially confirmed ORG decision and partially granted the applicant a reduction of maintenance payments . On DATE it dismissed the applicant \u2019s bias contention .", "On DATE the applicant introduced an extraordinary appeal on points of law ( au\u00dferordentlicher Revisionsrekurs ) , which on DATE was granted by ORG insofar as it concerned the partial reduction of maintenance payments , referring the case back to the first instance court . It considered that the extraordinary appeal granted only if there is insufficient case - law concerning a legal issue was admissible in the interests of legal certainty and uniformity .", "On DATE the competent Judge , ORG , requested that the President of ORG be withdrawn from the case for bias . On DATE the applicant filed an application for a time - limit to be set for the delivery of a decision on that request . On DATE the President himself requested that he be withdrawn from the case for bias . Both requests were dismissed . Judge PERSON \u2019s further appeal , dated CARDINAL DATE , was rejected on DATE .", "Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant had filed an application challenging the probable substitute Judge PERSON for bias . Moreover , on DATE , the applicant filed a motion challenging Judge PERSON for bias . On DATE he filed an application for a time - limit to be set for the delivery of a decision on his latter request .", "His applications were dismissed on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , following the applicant \u2019s appeal , withdrew Judge PERSON from the case .", "On DATE Judge PERSON was appointed to deal with the case but was also challenged for bias by the applicant on DATE . On DATE Judge PERSON was appointed to deal with the case .", "On DATE the court clerk issued a summons for a hearing scheduled for DATE .", "On DATE the applicant requested a time - limit to be fixed for the continuation of the proceedings . On DATE this application was dismissed because correspondence had crossed .", "On DATE and DATE the applicant , and on DATE the defendants , filed pleadings with the court .", "On DATE an expert was appointed in order to establish the applicant \u2019s income and financial position . On DATE the Linz ORG rendered a partial judgment on the maintenance claim , the decision on the remainder being postponed until the delivery of the expert opinion .", "On DATE the applicant filed a motion requesting a time - limit to be fixed for the delivery of the decision on the reduction of maintenance payments .", "On DATE the applicant , as well as the defendant , appealed against ORG decision of DATE . On DATE ORG , deciding on the remainder of the applicant \u2019s claim , refused the reduction of the maintenance payments and , instead , ordered their increase . It noted that an exact evaluation of the applicant \u2019s financial position had not been possible as the applicant had not provided the expert with the necessary documents . Therefore it had to be presumed that the applicant could afford the fixed amount of maintenance because otherwise he would have given the relevant documents to the expert .", "On DATE the applicant appealed . On DATE ORG partly granted the appeals of CARDINAL and DATE . The applicant as well as his children appealed from this decision .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeals . The decision was served on the applicant in DATE .", "II . Official liability proceedings", "The applicant instituted official liability proceedings ( Amtshaftung ) against the ORG claiming compensation for damages resulting from legal errors and delays caused by the court clerk . His claim related to the written pleadings of DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , his motions for a time - limit to be fixed of DATE and DATE , and his appeals of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE , which had been prompted by the court clerk \u2019s conduct . He argued that the ORG was also liable for the proper organisation of court proceedings which had failed in his case because a secondary file concerning only the maintenance matters should have been opened much earlier due to the complexity of the litigation .", "On DATE ORG granted compensation in respect of CARDINAL pleadings and appeals . It noted in particular that the delay of DATE , as from CARDINAL DATE , when the applicant had introduced the request for reduction of maintenance payments , until DATE , when the file finally had been transferred to the expert , had been too long , which engaged the ORG \u2019s liability and obligation to pay damages .", "The applicant appealed against this decision insofar as his appeal of DATE against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE was concerned . He did not appeal against the remainder of the above decision .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s appeal and awarded further damages ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
