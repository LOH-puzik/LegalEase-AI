ORG During the first trial , it emerged that details of a telephone conversation to which Mr. PERSON had been a party prior to CARDINAL DATE were contained in the note - book of the police officer in charge of the investigations . Counsel for the prosecution then accepted that this conversation had been intercepted on the authority of a warrant issued by the Secretary of ORG for ORG .", "CARDINAL .

He based his belief on delay to and signs of interference with his correspondence . In particular , he produced to the Commission bundles of envelopes which had been delivered to him either sealed with an adhesive tape of an identical kind or in an unsealed state . As to his telephone communications , he stated that he had heard unusual noises on his telephone and alleged that the police had at times been in possession of information which they could only have obtained by telephone tapping .

According to the ORG , this interception was carried out in full conformity with the law and the relevant procedures . No disclosure was made either at the trial of the applicant or during the course of the applicant \u2019s proceedings against the Commissioner of Police as to whether the applicant \u2019s own telephone number had been tapped or as to whether other and , if so , what other , telephone conversations to which the applicant was a party had been intercepted . The primary reasons given for withholding this information were that disclosure would or might frustrate the purpose of telephone interceptions and might also serve to identify other sources of police information , particularly police informants , and thereby place in jeopardy the source in question . For similar reasons , the ORG declined to disclose before the ORG or the ORG to what extent , if at all , the applicant \u2019s telephone calls and correspondence had been intercepted on behalf of the police authorities . It was however denied that the resealing with adhesive tape or the delivery unsealed of the envelopes produced to the ORG was attributable directly or indirectly to any interception .

ORG The legal basis of the practice of intercepting telephone communications was also examined by the Vice - Chancellor in his judgment in the action which the applicant brought against ORG Commissioner ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Certain changes have occurred in the organisation of the postal and telephone services since DATE , when ORG made its report . ORG , which ran both services , was then a ORG under the direct control of a Minister ( ORG ) . By virtue of ORG DATE , it became a public corporation with a certain independence of the ORG , though subject to various ministerial powers of supervision and control exercised at the material time by the ORG Secretary . ORG DATE was repealed in part and amended by LAW DATE . That Act divided ORG into CARDINAL corporations : ORG , responsible for mail , and ORG , responsible for telephones . The DATE Act made no change of substance in relation to the law governing interceptions . For the sake of convenience , references in the present judgment are to the position as it was before the DATE Act came into force .", "CARDINAL . ORG The existence of a power vested in the Secretary of ORG to authorise by warrant the interception of correspondence , in the sense of detaining and opening correspondence transmitted by post , has been acknowledged from early times and its exercise has been publicly known ( see the PERSON report , Part I , especially paras . CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ) . The precise origin in law of this executive authority is obscure ( ibid . , para . CARDINAL ) . Nevertheless , although none of the Post Office statutes ( of DATE , DATE , DATE or DATE ) contained clauses expressly conferring authority to intercept communications , all recognised the power as an independently existing power which it was lawful to exercise ( ibid . , paras .

ORG It was held in a case decided in DATE ( Attorney General v. ORG , ( DATE ) CARDINAL Queen \u2019s Bench Division CARDINAL ) that a telephone conversation is a \" telegraphic communication \" for the purposes of FAC . It has not been disputed in the present proceedings that the offences under the Telegraph Acts apply to telephone conversations .", "CARDINAL . ORG The power to intercept telephone messages has been exercised in GPE and GPE from time to time since the introduction of the telephone . Until DATE , ORG , which was at that time a ORG , acted upon the view that the power which the ORG exercised in intercepting telephone messages was a power possessed by any operator of telephones and was not contrary to law . Consequently , no warrants by the Secretary of ORG were issued and arrangements for the interception of telephone conversations were made directly between the police authorities and ORG . In DATE , the position was reviewed by the Home Secretary and ORG ( the Minister then responsible for the administration of ORG ) and it was decided , as a matter of policy , that it was undesirable that records of telephone conversations should be made by ORG servants and disclosed to the police without the authority of the Secretary of ORG . The view was taken that the power which had for long been exercised to intercept postal communications on the authority of a warrant of the Secretary of ORG was , by its nature , wide enough to include the interception of telephone communications . Since DATE it had accordingly been the practice of ORG to intercept telephone conversations only on the express warrant of the Secretary of ORG ( see the PERSON report , paras . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "ORG considered that the power to intercept telephone communications rested upon the power plainly recognised by the Post Office statutes as existing before the enactment of the statutes ( PERSON report , para . CARDINAL ) . It concluded ( ibid . , para . CARDINAL ) :", "\" We are therefore of the opinion that the state of the law might fairly be expressed in this way .", "( a ) The power to intercept letters has been exercised from the earliest times , and has been recognised in successive Acts of ORG .", "( b ) This power extends to telegrams .", "( c ) It is difficult to resist the view that if there is a lawful power to intercept communications in the form of letters and telegrams , then it is wide enough to cover telephone communications as well . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG Under LAW DATE , ORG \" ceased to be a ORG and was established as a public corporation of that name with the powers , duties and functions set out in the LAW . In consequence of the change of status of ORG and of the fact that ORG was no longer under the direct control of a Minister of the ORG , it became necessary to make express statutory provision in relation to the interception of communications on the authority of a warrant of the Secretary of ORG . By section CARDINAL of the Act it was therefore provided as follows :", "\" A requirement to do what is necessary to inform designated persons holding office under the ORG concerning matters and things transmitted or in course of transmission by means of postal or telecommunication services provided by ORG may be laid on ORG for the like purposes and in the like manner as , at the passing of this LAW , a requirement may be laid on the Postmaster General to do what is necessary to inform such persons concerning matters and things transmitted or in course of transmission by means of such services provided by him . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The DATE Act also introduced , for the first time , an express statutory defence to the offences under the Telegraph Acts mentioned above ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) , similar to that which exists under section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW DATE . This was effected by paragraph CARDINAL sub - paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL to the Act , which reads :", "\" In any proceedings against a person in respect of an offence under LAW of LAW DATE or LAW of ORG ) Act DATE consisting in the improper divulging of the purport of a message or communication or an offence under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE it shall be a defence for him to prove that the act constituting the offence was done in obedience to a warrant under the hand of a Secretary of ORG . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG In the civil action which he brought against ORG Commissioner , Mr. PERSON sought various relief including declarations to the following effect :", "- that any \" tapping \" ( that is , interception , monitoring or recording ) of conversations on his telephone lines without his consent , or disclosing the contents thereof , was unlawful even if done pursuant to a warrant of the Home Secretary ;", "- that he had rights of property , privacy and confidentiality in respect of conversations on his telephone lines and that the above - stated tapping and disclosure were in breach of those rights ;", "- that the tapping of his telephone lines violated LAW article CARDINAL) of the LAW .", "In his judgment , delivered on DATE , the Vice - Chancellor noted that he had no jurisdiction to make the declaration claimed in respect of LAW article CARDINAL) of the Convention . He made a detailed examination of the domestic law relating to telephone tapping , held in substance that the practice of tapping on behalf of the police as recounted in the PERSON report was legal and accordingly dismissed the action .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Vice - Chancellor described the central issue before him as being in simple form : is telephone tapping in aid of the police in their functions relating to crime illegal ? He further delimited the question as follows :", "\" ... the only form of telephone tapping that has been debated is tapping which consists of the making of recordings by ORG officials in some part of the existing telephone system , and the making of those recordings available to police officers for the purposes of transcription and use . I am not concerned with any form of tapping that involved electronic devices which make wireless transmissions , nor with any process whereby anyone trespasses onto the premises of the subscriber or anyone else to affix tapping devices or the like . All that I am concerned with is the legality of tapping effected by means of recording telephone conversations from wires which , though connected to the premises of the subscriber , are not on them . \" ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports , p. CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . ORG The Vice - Chancellor held that there was no right of property ( as distinct from copyright ) in words transmitted along telephone lines ( ibid . , p. CARDINAL ) .", "As to the applicant \u2019s remaining contentions based on privacy and confidentiality , he observed firstly that no assistance could be derived from cases dealing with other kinds of warrant . Unlike a search of LOC , the process of telephone tapping on ORG premises did not involve any act of trespass and so was not prima facie illegal ( ibid . , p. CARDINAL ) . Secondly , referring to the warrant of the Home Secretary , the Vice - Chancellor remarked that such warrant did not \" purport to be issued under the authority of any statute or of the common law \" . The decision to introduce such warrants in DATE seemed \" plainly to have been an administrative decision not dictated or required by statute \" ( ibid . ) . He referred , however , to section CARDINAL of the Post Office Act DATE and Schedule CARDINAL to the Act , on which ORG had based certain contentions summarised as follows :", "\" Although the previous arrangements had been merely administrative , they had been set out in the PERSON report DATE , and the section plainly referred to these arrangements ; ... A warrant was not needed to make the tapping lawful : it was lawful without any warrant . But where the tapping was done under warrant ... [ section DATE ] afforded statutory recognition of the lawfulness of the tapping . \" ( ibid . , p. CARDINAL )", "\" In their essentials \" , stated the Vice - Chancellor , \" these contentions seem to me to be sound . \" He accepted that , by LAW ,", "\" ORG has provided a clear recognition of the warrant of the ORG Secretary as having an effective function in law , both as providing a defence to certain criminal charges , and also as amounting to an effective requirement for ORG to do certain acts \" ( ibid . , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "The Vice - Chancellor further concluded that there was in LANGUAGE law neither a general right of privacy nor , as the applicant had contended , a particular right of privacy to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy of one \u2019s home without molestation ( ibid . , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . Moreover , no duty of confidentiality existed between ORG and the telephone subscriber ; nor was there any other obligation of confidence on a person who overheard a telephone conversation , whether by means of tapping or otherwise ( ibid . , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Turning to the arguments based on the Convention , the Vice - Chancellor noted firstly that the LAW was not part of the law of GPE and , as such , did not confer on the applicant direct rights that could be enforced in the NORP courts ( ibid . , p. CARDINAL ) .", "He then considered the applicant \u2019s argument that the LAW , as interpreted by ORG in the case of PERSON and Others ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , could be used as a guide to assist in the determination of LANGUAGE law on a point that was uncertain . He observed that the issues before him did not involve construing legislation enacted with the purpose of giving effect to obligations imposed by the LAW . Where ORG had abstained from legislating on a point that was plainly suitable for legislation , it was difficult for the court to lay down new rules that would carry out the ORG \u2019s treaty obligations , or to discover for the first time that such rules had always existed . He compared the system of safeguards considered in the PERSON case with the NORP system , as described in the PERSON report , and concluded :", "\" ... Not a single one of these safeguards is to be found as a matter of established law in GPE , and only a few corresponding provisions exist as a matter of administrative procedure .", "It does not , of course , follow that a system with fewer or different safeguards will fail to satisfy LAW article CARDINAL) in the eyes of ORG . At the same time , it is impossible to read the judgment in the PERSON case without it becoming abundantly clear that a system which has no legal safeguards whatever has small chance of satisfying the requirements of that ORG , whatever administrative provisions there may be . ... Even if the system [ in operation in GPE ] were to be considered adequate in its conditions , it is laid down merely as a matter of administrative procedure , so that it is unenforceable in law , and as a matter of law could at any time be altered without warning or subsequent notification . Certainly in law any \u2018 adequate and effective safeguards against ORG are wanting . In this respect LANGUAGE law compares most unfavourably with NORP law : this is not a subject on which it is possible to feel any pride in LANGUAGE law .", "I therefore find it impossible to see how LANGUAGE law could be said to satisfy the requirements of the LAW , as interpreted in the PERSON case , unless that law not only prohibited all telephone tapping save in suitably limited classes of case , but also laid down detailed restrictions on the exercise of the power in those limited classes . \"", "This conclusion did not , however , enable the Vice - Chancellor to decide the case in the way the applicant sought :", "\" It may perhaps be that the common law is sufficiently fertile to achieve what is required by the first limb of [ the above - stated proviso ] : possible ways of expressing such a rule may be seen in what I have already said . But I see the greatest difficulty in the common law framing the safeguards required by the second limb . Various institutions or offices would have to be brought into being to exercise various defined functions . The more complex and indefinite the subject - matter the greater the difficulty in the court doing what it is really appropriate , and only appropriate , for the legislature to do . Furthermore , I find it hard to see what there is in the present case to require the LANGUAGE courts to struggle with such a problem . Give full rein to the LAW , and it is clear that when the object of the surveillance is the detection of crime , the question is not whether there ought to be a general prohibition of all surveillance , but in what circumstances , and subject to what conditions and restrictions , it ought to be permitted . It is those circumstances , conditions and restrictions which are at the centre of this case ; and yet it is they which are the least suitable for determination by judicial decision .", "... Any regulation of so complex a matter as telephone tapping is essentially a matter for ORG , not the courts ; and neither the ORG nor the PERSON case can , I think , play any proper part in deciding the issue before me . \" ( ibid . , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL )", "He added that \" this case seems to me to make it plain that telephone tapping is a subject which cries out for legislation \" , and continued :", "\" However much the protection of the public against crime demands that in proper cases the police should have the assistance of telephone tapping , I would have thought that in any civilised system of law the claims of liberty and justice would require that telephone users should have effective and independent safeguards against possible abuses . The fact that a telephone user is suspected of crime increases rather than diminishes this requirement : suspicions , however reasonably held , may sometimes prove to be wholly unfounded . If there were effective and independent safeguards , these would not only exclude some cases of excessive zeal but also , by their mere existence , provide some degree of reassurance for those who are resentful of the police or believe themselves to be persecuted . \" ( ibid . , p. CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . ORG As a final point of substance , the Vice - Chancellor dealt , in the following terms , with the applicant \u2019s contention that as no power to tap telephones had been given by either statute or common law , the tapping was necessarily unlawful :", "\" I have already held that , if such tapping can be carried out without committing any breach of the law , it requires no authorisation by statute or common law ; it can lawfully be done simply because there is nothing to make it unlawful . Now that I have held that such tapping can indeed be carried out without committing any breach of the law , the contention necessarily fails . I may also say that the statutory recognition given to the Home Secretary \u2019s warrant seems to me to point clearly to the same conclusion . \" ( ibid . , p. CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . ORG The Vice - Chancellor therefore held that the applicant \u2019s claim failed in its entirety . He made the following concluding remarks as to the ambit of his decision :", "\" Though of necessity I have discussed much , my actual decision is closely limited . It is confined to the tapping of the telephone lines of a particular person which is effected by ORG LOC in pursuance of a warrant of the Home Secretary in a case in which the police have just cause or excuse for requesting the tapping , in that it will assist them in performing their functions in relation to crime , whether in prevention , detection , discovering the criminals or otherwise , and in which the material obtained is used only by the police , and only for those purposes . In particular , I decide nothing on tapping effected for other purposes , or by other persons , or by other means ; nothing on tapping when the information is supplied to persons other than the police ; and nothing on tapping when the police use the material for purposes other than those I have mentioned . The principles involved in my decision may or may not be of some assistance in such other cases , whether by analogy or otherwise : but my actual decision is limited in the way that I have just stated . \" ( ibid . , p. CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . ORG Following the Vice - Chancellor \u2019s judgment , the necessity for legislation concerning the interception of communications was the subject of review by the Government , and of NORP discussion . On DATE , on the publication of ORG , the ORG Secretary announced in ORG that after carefully considering the suggestions proffered by the Vice - Chancellor in his judgment , the ORG had decided not to introduce legislation . He explained the reasons for this decision in the following terms :", "\" The interception of communications is , by definition , a practice that depends for its effectiveness and value upon being carried out in secret , and can not therefore be subject to the normal processes of parliamentary control . Its acceptability in a NORP society depends on its being subject to ministerial control , and on the readiness of the public and their representatives in ORG to repose their trust in the Ministers concerned to exercise that control responsibly and with a right sense of balance between the value of interception as a means of protecting order and security and the threat which it may present to the liberty of the subject .", "Within the necessary limits of secrecy , I and my right hon . Friends who are concerned are responsible to ORG for our stewardship in this sphere . There would be no more sense in making such secret matters justiciable than there would be in my being obliged to reveal them in the ORG . If the power to intercept were to be regulated by statute , then the courts would have power to inquire into the matter and to do so , if not publicly , then at least in the presence of the complainant . This must surely limit the use of interception as a tool of investigation . The Government have come to the clear conclusion that the procedures , conditions and safeguards described in the [ White ] Paper ensure strict control of interception by Ministers , are a good and sufficient protection for the liberty of the subject , and would not be made significantly more effective for that purpose by being embodied in legislation . The Government have accordingly decided not to introduce legislation on these matters \" ( ORG , ORG , DATE , cols . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "He gave an assurance that \" ORG will be informed of any changes that are made in the arrangements \" ( ibid . , col . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the course of the NORP proceedings leading to the enactment of LAW DATE , attempts were made to include in the PERSON provisions which would have made it an offence to intercept mail or matters sent by public telecommunication systems except pursuant to a warrant issued under conditions which corresponded substantially to those described in the White Paper . The Government successfully opposed these moves , primarily on the grounds that secrecy , which was essential if interception was to be effective , could not be maintained if the arrangements for interception were laid down by legislation and thus became justiciable in the courts . The present arrangements and safeguards were adequate and the proposed new provisions were , in the ORG \u2019s view , unworkable and unnecessary ( see , for example , the statement of ORG in ORG on DATE , ORG , cols . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . The DATE Act eventually contained a re - enactment of section CARDINAL of the Post Office Act DATE applicable to ORG , para . CARDINAL , of the DATE Act ) . LAW of LAW itself continues to apply to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG In its report presented to ORG in DATE ( ORG ) , ORG , which had been appointed in DATE , also considered the possible need for legislation in this field . In the chapter entitled \" Investigative powers and the rights of the citizen \" , ORG made the following recommendation in regard to what it termed \" surreptitious surveillance \" ( paras . CARDINAL - CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) :", "\" ... [ A]lthough we have no evidence that the existing controls are inadequate to prevent abuse , we think that there are strong arguments for introducing a system of statutory control on similar lines to that which we have recommended for search warrants . As with all features of police investigative procedures , the value of prescribing them in statutory form is that it brings clarity and precision to the rules ; they are open to public scrutiny and to the potential of Parliamentary review . So far as surveillance devices in general are concerned this is not at present so .", "...", "We therefore recommend that the use of surveillance devices by the police ( including the interception of letters and telephone communications ) should be regulated by statute . \"", "These recommendations were not adopted by the Government .", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE , ORG , a permanent body set up by statute in DATE for the purpose of promoting reform of the law , produced a report on breach of confidence ( presented to ORG in DATE Paper CARDINAL ) . This report examined , inter alia , the implications for the civil law of confidence of the acquisition of information by surveillance devices , and made various proposals for reform of the law ( paras . PERCENT ) . ORG , however , felt that the question whether \" the methods which the police ... may use to obtain information should be defined by statute \" was a matter outside the scope of its report ( paras . CARDINAL and CARDINAL in fine ) . No action has been taken by the Government on this report .", "CARDINAL . ORG Details of the current practices followed in relation to interceptions are set out in the Government \u2019s ORG of DATE .

ORG The police , ORG and Excise and ORG may request authority for the interception of communications for the purposes of \" detection of serious crime and the safeguarding of the security of the ORG \" ( paragraph CARDINAL of the White Paper ) . Interception may take place only on the authority of the Secretary of ORG given by warrant under his own hand . In GPE and GPE , the power to grant such warrants is exercised by the ORG Secretary or occasionally , if he is ill or absent , by another Secretary of ORG on his behalf ( ibid . ) . In the case of warrants applied for by the police to assist them in the detection of crime , CARDINAL conditions must be satisfied before a warrant will be issued :", "( a ) the offence must be \" really serious \" ;", "( b ) normal methods of investigation must have been tried and failed or must , from the nature of things , be unlikely to succeed ;", "( c ) there must be good reason to think that an interception would be likely to lead to an arrest and a conviction .", "CARDINAL . ORG As is indicated in the PERSON report ( paras . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , the concept of \" serious crime \" has varied from time to time . Changing circumstances have made some acts serious offences which were not previously so regarded ; equally , some offences formerly regarded as serious enough to justify warrants for the interception of communications have ceased to be so regarded . Thus , the interception of letters believed to contain obscene or indecent matter ceased in DATE ( PERSON report , para . CARDINAL ) ; no warrants for the purpose of preventing the transmission of illegal lottery material have been issued since DATE ( ibid . , para .

CARDINAL ) . In DATE , the ORG Secretary announced to ORG that , on a recommendation made by Lord PERSON in his second report ( see paragraph DATE below ) , the concept of a serious offence was to be extended to cover offences which would not necessarily attract a penalty of CARDINAL PERSON imprisonment on first conviction , but in which the financial rewards of success were very large ( ORG , ORG , DATE , col .
