From DATE to DATE and from DATE to CARDINAL DATE he was a Member of ORG and from DATE to DATE he was First Deputy Minister of ORG . His father - in - law was President of ORG from DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE and then DATE the applicant was one of the equity partners of the law firm ORG ( subsequently renamed ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the ORG - owned joint - stock company ORG ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c NORP \u201d ) , which was involved in several serious disputes before ORG , decided to extend the legal services agreement which it had concluded with ORG in DATE and which was about to expire .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , acting in his capacity as First Deputy Minister of Justice , sent a letter to GPE , at the latter \u2019s request , informing it of the existence of exceptional conditions , as provided under domestic law , for purchasing legal services from ORG without inviting bids from other law firms . It was noted that ORG had been providing GPE with legal services for a long time , including in the proceedings before ORG . Accordingly , changing the legal DATE provider would be costly and unjustified .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s letter , which was subsequently submitted to ORG , provided the basis for PERSON to contract further legal services from ORG without pursuing a bidding procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) opened a criminal case under LAW of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in respect of alleged forgery of the letter of CARDINAL DATE by unspecified officials at ORG . On DATE the GPE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) quashed the above ruling after a complaint by the applicant . On DATE and DATE ORG ( \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) and ORG , respectively , upheld the first - instance court \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG opened another criminal case in respect of the same facts , this time under LAW of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on suspicion of abuse of office with grave consequences by unspecified ORG officials . On DATE the ORG quashed that ruling . Its decision was upheld by the appellate court on DATE . It appears that it was not challenged on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG faxed the applicant \u201c an invitation \u201d to go to its offices at TIME DATE for questioning about \u201c possible abuse of office and forgery by officials of ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG re - sent the \u201c invitation \u201d to the applicant . This time his questioning was expected at TIME on DATE . However , he did not appear before the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG instructed the GPE city police to establish the applicant \u2019s whereabouts and to hand him a summons for questioning at TIME on DATE . The letter noted that the applicant had not been present at his address as established by the investigation .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE the ORG enquired with ORG regarding the applicant \u2019s trips abroad in DATE and DATE . According to the information it received on DATE , the applicant had left GPE CARDINAL times during the period in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an official of the GPE city police wrote to the ORG that its information about the applicant \u2019s address was outdated ( he had sold the flat in DATE and had not lived there since ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG enquired with the GPE city and regional address bureau about the applicant \u2019s registered address and received a reply on DATE that he lived in GPE in the GPE region .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant under LAW of the ORG ( exceeding of powers by an official leading to grave consequences \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In describing the applicant \u2019s actus reus , the prosecutor found that he had bypassed the registry of ORG when accepting the request from PERSON and issuing his letter in reply ; that his conclusion about the existence of exceptional conditions for PERSON not to pursue a bidding procedure had been in contradiction with the applicable legal provisions ; and that he had had no right to put that conclusion on official ORG paper . The subsequent extension by PERSON of its contract with ORG had caused considerable losses to the ORG budget .", "CARDINAL . DATE the investigator called the applicant by telephone to summon him for questioning . At the time , he was in hospital with his wife , who was giving birth to their third child .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE , the applicant appeared before the investigator and after being questioned was arrested at TIME under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . According to the official report , the applicant had been arrested on the grounds that \u201c eyewitnesses , including victims , directly identified [ him ] as the one who had committed the offence \u201d . His arrest was justified by the necessity to prevent him evading justice or from obstructing the establishment of the truth , and to ensure the execution of an eventual court judgment . The arrest report had the following description of the facts giving rise to the prosecution :", "\u201c ... during the period from DATE [ the applicant ] , exceeding his official powers , issued an expert conclusion with knowingly false information , as a result of which considerable damage , amounting to CARDINAL [ NORP ] hryvnias [ equal to CARDINAL at the time ] was caused to [ GPE ] . In other words , he is suspected of committing a criminal offence under LAW of the [ ORG ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The procedural rights of arrestees were also listed . The applicant signed it with a remark that he considered his arrest as unlawful given that he had complied with the investigator \u2019s summons in accordance with the ORG and that there was no risk of him hindering the establishment of the truth as he was no longer a civil servant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was officially charged under LAW of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged his arrest before a court . He claimed that the investigator had failed to refer to any factual circumstances to justify his arrest under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG . The applicant contended that he had appeared before the investigator upon the latter \u2019s first summons , despite the fact that on DATE his wife had been in hospital giving birth . That indicated , in his opinion , that he had had no intention of absconding or hindering the investigation .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE the investigator applied to the court for the applicant to be held in pre - trial detention . The necessity of that preventive measure was explained as follows :", "\u201c Having regard to [ the applicant \u2019s ] role in the commission of the offence and his causing serious damage to ORG interests , his age , state of health , family and financial situation , and other circumstances characterising him , the investigation has grounds to believe that [ the applicant ] will try to influence the witnesses in this case given his extensive networks in law - enforcement bodies and among judicial authorities .", "Furthermore , the case file contains sufficient evidence showing that [ the applicant ] avoided appearing before the investigation authorities , that he travels abroad regularly and that he is absent from his registered address . That being so , if at liberty , he will abscond or hinder the investigation and the implementation of procedural decisions .", "Therefore , the application of any other preventive measure in respect of the accused ... will not be able to ensure his proper procedural conduct and the fulfilment of procedural decisions ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the case file did not contain sufficient information about the applicant in order to take a decision on the investigator \u2019s application . In particular , the file did not contain sufficient information about the applicant \u2019s health , family and financial situation or his occupation . The court therefore extended the applicant \u2019s preliminary detention to DATE as a temporary preventive measure . The decision was not subject to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the investigator \u2019s application ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as well - founded and ordered the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention . The court further held that that finding rendered it unnecessary to examine alternative preventive measures . It rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint about his arrest as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . He reiterated his earlier arguments on the alleged unlawfulness of his arrest by the investigator ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Furthermore , he complained that ORG had failed to justify the application of what was the most intrusive preventive measure available in his case . He argued that the court had not taken into account the fact that he was the sole breadwinner for his CARDINAL children and his wife and that their newborn child was still in hospital . Positive character references and his requests for a non - custodial preventive measure had also been disregarded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG applied to ORG , offering his personal surety for the applicant \u2019s release . In the alternative , he indicated that he was ready to pay bail for the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the findings and reasoning of ORG decision of DATE . There was no reference in the ruling to the application by ORG President .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was additionally charged with forging an official document under LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the pre - trial investigation was declared completed and the applicant was given access to the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention to DATE , finding that there were no grounds to change the preliminary measure to a more lenient one .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator released the applicant under an undertaking not to abscond . The change of preventive measure was explained by the fact that the applicant could no longer influence witnesses or impede the investigation . The investigator also made a general reference to the applicant \u2019s age , state of health , family and financial situation , as well as the fact that he had children to care for , permanent employment and positive character references .", "CARDINAL . As known from public available material , some media outlets linked the applicant \u2019s release to a private meeting between his father - in - law as the President of ORG and the President of GPE DATE , on DATE . The applicant publicly denied those rumours .", "CARDINAL . The parties did not inform the ORG of any further developments in the criminal proceedings against the applicant . Publicly available material shows that he was amnestied in DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
