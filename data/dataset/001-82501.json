He grew raspberries there and had a lucrative contract with the shop ORG , but lost it in DATE when the local environmental health officer let it be known to the shop that the applicant was packing raspberries in his kitchen . The applicant and his wife sued ORG and ORG ( ' DOLGE ' ) for mis - statement and were awarded over GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL in damages by the Manx High Court on DATE . The applicant did not consider that this was enough , and , wishing to appeal , instructed a new ( NORP ) advocate , a PERSON PERSON , then a partner in a firm of advocates called PERSON ORG CJM ' ) .", "Mr PERSON advised that there was merit in an appeal , and applied for legal aid on his client 's behalf in DATE : this application was rejected on CARDINAL DATE . The applicant 's ORG from the first instance judgment was rejected DATE because it had been filed DATE . Mr PERSON advised ( via letter and at a meeting ) that it would not be unduly difficult to apply for an extension of time in which to lodge the appeal , but that , in the circumstances , the best course of action was for the applicant to cut his losses and to accept an offer put forward by ORG . The applicant accepted this advice and , on DATE , ORG 's offer of GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP CJM issued proceedings against the applicant for payment of their fees on DATE . An advocate instructed by the applicant to defend the claim failed to file a Defence in the prescribed period , and judgment was entered for ORG on DATE . After taxation of ORG 's costs , judgment was issued on DATE for a total of ORG .

The applicant appealed on DATE and on DATE Mr PERSON wrote to the Coroner and the applicant requesting that no further steps be taken in respect of the enforcement of the execution against the applicant until specifically instructed . It appears that the execution remained suspended until the judgment of CARDINAL DATE detailed below .", "CARDINAL . After a delay occasioned by their difficulty in obtaining legal aid , the applicant and his wife brought proceedings on DATE against ORG in negligence , claiming that ORG 's actions and omissions in DATE had deprived them of the opportunity to pursue their appeal against the first instance decision in their case against ORG . These proceedings are referred to hereafter as \u201c the ORG proceedings . \u201d In them , the applicant and his wife were represented throughout by leading Counsel from GPE , who had been granted a special temporary licence as a NORP advocate . The proceedings were heard by Acting PERSON , succeeded by Acting PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The summons issued on DATE was not served on ORG until DATE , the time for service of the summons having been extended by ORG on DATE . After the applicant filed a motion for judgment in default of defence on DATE , it appears a first defence was served out of time on DATE . A second defence was served on DATE . After the service of this second defence , a motion filed by the applicant for judgment in default was dismissed by consent on DATE . On DATE the defendants filed a motion for a split trial between liability and quantum issues , which was dismissed on DATE . It appears that there had been no correspondence between the parties and ORG DATE and DATE , leading ORG to write to the defendants on DATE indicating , inter alia , that Acting PERSON \u201c was very anxious to progress the matter \u201d . After the dismissal of the defendant 's motion for a split trial on DATE , it appears it was incumbent on the applicant to apply to have the case set down for trial within DATE of this date . No application was made . On DATE , ORG wrote to the applicant 's solicitors requesting that they make the necessary application as soon as possible . On DATE , the applicant 's solicitors replied , apologising for the delay in their application . On DATE , ORG replied with instructions from ORG that the case be set down for trial within DATE . Both parties responded expressing concern at this proposal .", "It further appears that throughout DATE the parties each filed a number of motions , the defendants requesting a stay in the proceedings and each seeking leave to amend the statement of case , the defence and reply . Further such motions were sought throughout DATE and DATE and DATE . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE , ORG made orders setting further directions for the proceedings . Further orders were agreed by consent between the parties on DATE , DATE and DATE , in each instance agreeing to a revised timetable and date for trial . On DATE the applicant issued a motion for additional time to serve a further expert report to which the defendants responded with a motion that the action be struck out for non - compliance with orders of ORG . In order to hear the motions , ORG vacated the scheduled trial date . They were heard on DATE with the defendant 's motion being dismissed , the applicant being given leave to serve the expert report and further directions being given to the parties .", "CARDINAL . The ORG proceedings did not therefore come to trial before Acting PERSON until DATE , at which point ORG essentially conceded liability and limited themselves to contesting quantum . By a judgment dated CARDINAL DATE : ( CARDINAL ) the judgments obtained by ORG in DATE were set aside ( by consent ) and these earlier proceedings dismissed ; and ( CARDINAL ) the applicant and his wife were awarded the sum of ORG plus interest of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his wife appealed against the quantum of the award ; their appeal was dismissed on DATE . In a detailed CARDINAL page judgment , ORG of GPE ) considered and dismissed each head of their challenge to the conclusions of the first instance judge . It seems that the applicant 's Counsel was directed by the lead judge at the end of the hearing that his interest was now at end .", "CARDINAL . The applicant wished to apply to ORG for special leave to appeal directly to ORG but it appears that after failing to obtain such leave as a \u201c poor person \u201d and failing to obtain legal aid from the NORP authorities , he did not do so .", "CARDINAL .
