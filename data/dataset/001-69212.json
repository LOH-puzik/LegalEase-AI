FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively . They were shareholders in CARDINAL limited liability companies . It appears that at least PERSON was also in a management position in those companies . Both companies were in the process of being wound up from DATE .", "CARDINAL . W. , a lawyer working for the bank which was the main creditor of the companies , was appointed as the official receiver to control the assets of the companies . Having received a special auditor \u2019s reports about the companies PERSON , on DATE , requested the police to investigate whether offences had been committed in the companies before they went into liquidation . The police interview of the official receiver began on DATE and continued in DATE . PERSON was questioned by the police for the first time on DATE . DATE he was also arrested and a large number of documents were seized from both the applicants . ORG was questioned by the police on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) revoked the seizure of the documents , as requested by GPE , as the time - limit of DATE had passed since they had been seized and no charges had been brought against the applicants during that time . The decision became a precedent ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were questioned several times in the course of the investigations during the period from DATE until DATE . It appears that the police investigations concerning the CARDINAL companies came to an end in DATE and DATE or DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . S.E. petitioned the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman , who in her decision of CARDINAL DATE took the view that the pre - trial investigations should have been speedier .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were charged with offences as dishonest debtors . Writs of summons were served upon LOC on DATE and on CARDINAL DATE and upon ORG on CARDINAL DATE . CARDINAL oral hearings were held in GPE ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE . PERSON was absent from the first hearing due to a lawful impediment . At the second hearing the complainants requested a deferral which was granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled inadmissible the charges brought against the applicants , without considering their merits , on the grounds of their being in breach of procedural requirements . ORG found that the complainants , i.e. the meeting of the debtors , had not requested that charges be brought against the applicants . The mere fact that the official receiver had made a request to that effect was not sufficient , as the practice at the time of the alleged offences required that the decision should be made by the meeting of the debtors . ORG noted , however , that chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( rikoslaki , strafflagen ) , which had entered into force after the commission of the alleged offences , allowed for the official receiver to request a prosecution . ORG concluded that although the provision was of a procedural nature and as such applicable to offences committed prior to its entry into force , applying the provision in this case would lead to an unfavourable outcome for the applicants . Thus , ORG decided not to apply the new provision , and accordingly , not to consider the merits of the charges .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the public prosecutor , the complainants and GPE appealed . On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) found that the official receiver had been entitled to request criminal proceedings against the applicants under chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , as the application of that provision in the instant case neither affected the period of limitation nor subjected the applicants to a stricter criminal liability . ORG revoked ORG decision and remitted the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested leave to appeal . On DATE ORG granted them leave to appeal and invited the observations of the other parties . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG appeal for substantially the same reasons as those given by ORG . The decision became a precedent ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an application for an annulment . Further , they requested on DATE that ORG postpone the consideration of the annulment until ORG had given judgment and as ORG on DATE had informed them that the case would be decided shortly , they requested again that the application be stayed . However , on DATE they withdrew the application for an annulment .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the parties that the case would be restored to its case - list . It was , however , adjourned several times as there were settlement negotiations going on between the applicants and the complainants . The time - limit for submission of observations was extended until DATE upon request of the public prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a contract was signed between the complainants and the applicants , agreeing that they had no claims , either civil or criminal , against each other on the basis of the events mentioned above . According to the Government , the parties reached an agreement on compensation , whereas the applicants denied that the agreement concerned any form of compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor informed ORG that he wanted to withdraw all the charges against the applicants , finding that his right to bring charges had ceased to exist as the complainants had withdrawn their claims .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , at the oral hearing held on DATE in the ORG PERSON requested notwithstanding the withdrawal that it be examined whether the ORG prosecution request had been specific enough for charges to be brought and whether the period of limitation on the right to bring charges had become time - barred . The public prosecutor noted that CARDINAL witnesses had died since the police investigations , and that he might have withdrawn the charges in any event as the proceedings had already lasted an unreasonably long time . It was announced by ORG and the complainants that the case had been settled as far as they were concerned .", "ORG found on DATE that the public prosecutor could not withdraw the charges if there was an objection and that GPE had the right to a decision in the matter . The case was adjourned until DATE as far as LOC was concerned . The charges against ORG were removed from the docket and the decision was not appealed against .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having held an oral hearing , rejected CARDINAL of the charges as time - barred and ruled the rest inadmissible , without considering their merits . In so far as ORG refused to consider the merits , it found that the complainants had not particularised their allegations when reporting the alleged offences to the police in DATE or during the questioning of the official receiver in DATE , and that the time - limit for requesting prosecution , as stipulated by LAW ( rikoslain voimaanpanosta annettu asetus , f\u00f6rordningen om inf\u00f6rande av strafflagen ) , had thus been exceeded .", "CARDINAL . The public prosecutor and ORG appealed against ORG decision not to consider part of the charges . The case became pending before ORG in DATE .", "On DATE ORG , noting that GPE had a right to have the question of guilt examined and as part of that issue also whether the prosecution procedure had been in accordance with the law , found that the complainants had particularised their allegations sufficiently within the period of limitation , and therefore revoked the ORG decision to rule the charges inadmissible . Instead , ORG removed the charges from the docket as the applicants and the complainants had reached a settlement . LAW , LAW , as in force until DATE , provided that a debtor could not be convicted if he had satisfied his creditor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON applied to ORG for leave to appeal . The case was still pending before ORG when ORG decided to give notice of the application to the respondent ORG . On DATE ORG refused GPE leave to appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
