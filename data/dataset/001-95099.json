On DATE LAW ( hereinafter \u201c the CC \u201d ) was amended . In accordance with its newly introduced LAW , a general meeting of a joint stock company was empowered to decide to wind up the company and transfer all its assets to a shareholder who owned shares representing PERCENT of the company 's share capital ( \u201c the main shareholder \u201d ) . An asset transfer contract between the main shareholder and the company was to be concluded to that end and compensation paid to the minority shareholders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the general meeting of the company adopted , by votes of the main shareholder , a resolution on the winding - up of the company and on the transfer of all its assets to the main shareholder ( together also referred to as \u201c the transfer \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed an action to have that resolution and the asset transfer contract set aside with ORG ( m\u011bstsk\u00fd soud ) . They asserted that the resolution had been adopted contrary to law , treaties concerning the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments and their property rights . They informed the court administering the commercial register ( obchodn\u00ed rejst\u0159\u00edk ) about this step .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court administering the commercial register ( rejst\u0159\u00edkov\u00fd soud ) approved the transfer . No hearing was held prior to that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants contested the decision to register the transfer before ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00ed soud ) , alleging an infringement of the right to a fair trial and their property rights . They claimed not to have been able to raise their objections to the general meeting resolution in a hearing during the non - contentious proceedings preceding the delivery of the decision . They invited the court to strike down inter alia Articles CARDINALh(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and PERSON of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in its decision no . IV . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL rejected the applicants ' appeal without holding a hearing . It found that the applicants were not entitled to participate in the proceedings as the task of the court in charge of the commercial register had been to decide on the rights of the company , not on theirs . It noted that that court had the applicants ' arguments in their action to set aside at its disposal and had taken them into consideration before delivering the impugned decision , whilst reviewing the lawfulness of the resolution as a preliminary question . It held that the power to stay the proceedings was still available to that court under the law as it stood at the relevant time . ORG dismissed the applicants ' second claim according to which that decision amounted to other interference by public authority into their right to access to a court . Referring to Article CARDINALh of the ORG , it found the application of LAW in conformity with constitutional law . In this regard , the court pointed to procedural safeguards enshrined in Articles CARDINAL , ORG , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINALp of the ORG which were available to the applicants , and emphasised the aim of the regulation providing for legal certainty and expeditious transformation of companies . As for the applicants ' challenge to the law providing for the winding - up and the transfer on the ground of insufficient protection of the rights of minority shareholders , the court did not examine it since it went beyond the scope of that court 's review defined by the applicants ' constitutional appeal contesting the decision in which the court in charge of the commercial register had approved the registration of the winding - up and the transfer at the commercial register , but not any decisions adopted in other proceedings available to the complaining minority shareholders .", "CARDINAL .

As for the applicants ' plea of invalidity of the asset transfer contract , namely the insufficient number of experts commissioned for the expert report on the compensation and the determination of the decisive day ( rozhodn\u00fd den ) , the court expressed the view that the validity of the asset transfer contract must have been examined as a preliminary question by the court approving the registration of the transfer into the commercial register . At the same time , having reviewed the contract , ORG found that the determination of decisive day complied with the ORG . Having interpreted relevant provisions of the ORG , the court further found that the law did not require that more experts be commissioned for the purposes of assessing the compensation to be paid by the main shareholders to the applicants . Finally , the court examined and dismissed the applicants ' claims that the compensation had not been properly determined as unfounded or reviewable only by a court reviewing the compensation in separate proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

[ L]egitimate expectations of shareholders do not have the same intensity as those of owners of other property . .. [ as ] the nature of a joint stock company implies risks of a change in the shareholders ' status ...", "The gist of the appeal consists in the applicant 's disagreement with the law providing for [ the winding - up of a company and the transfer of its assets to its main shareholder ] as such , in particular with the insufficient guarantees for minority shareholders .
