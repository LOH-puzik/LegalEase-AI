The applicant was born in DATE and lives in FAC . He is the father of Mr Valdis Jasinskis ( \u201c the applicant 's son \u201d ) , a NORP national who was born in DATE and who died on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's son ( who had been deaf and mute since birth ) and several of his friends were drinking beer in a bar in FAC . Witness statements differ somewhat as to how much alcohol the applicant 's son consumed that night . After the applicant 's son 's death , a forensic expert took into the account witness testimonies and used Widmark 's equation to arrive at the estimate that , after finishing his last drink , the alcohol concentration in the applicant 's son 's blood would have been CARDINAL \u2030 , which meant that all traces of alcohol would have left his body TIME . The expert , however , noted that this figure was approximate . The applicant disagreed with the estimate , noting that such a concentration of alcohol would be deadly .", "CARDINAL . After leaving the bar , the applicant 's son and his friends walked to a nearby school where a party was taking place . In front of the school entrance ORG DATE a minor \u2013 pushed the applicant 's son , who fell backwards down the stairs in front of the school , hit his head against the ground and lost consciousness for TIME . The persons present then tried to attract the attention of the security guards , who were inside the school , by knocking on the locked doors . In the process a glass pane of the entrance doors was cracked . It appears from the subsequent investigation that the glass was broken by CARDINAL of the students of the school .", "CARDINAL . The security guards came outside and saw the applicant 's son lying unconscious on the ground . They called an ambulance and the police . After the applicant 's son had regained consciousness , the security guards sat him down on the stairs of the school .", "CARDINAL . The police arrived on the scene at CARDINAL a.m. They later reported that the applicant 's son had been unable to stand up on his own and had been flailing his arms . Upon their arrival the officers were informed that the applicant 's son was deaf and mute and that he had fallen down the stairs . They were also told that he was probably responsible for breaking the glass of the entrance doors .", "CARDINAL . The policemen decided not to wait for the ambulance that had been called and took the applicant 's son to the LOC Police station in order to initiate administrative proceedings for petty hooliganism and public drunkenness . The policemen alleged that in the car on the way to the police station the applicant 's son had behaved aggressively and had been flailing his arms and kicking .", "CARDINAL . The record of the administrative detention of the applicant 's son indicates that the reason for the detention was to \u201c sober up \u201d the detainee . The only injury that was noted was a graze on his face . The same record also notes that at CARDINAL TIME on the following day the applicant 's son was released from detention because he had \u201c sobered up \u201d ( but see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The policemen alleged that on the premises of the police station the applicant 's son had continued to behave aggressively by flailing his arms . The applicant submits that it is probable that his son was trying to communicate with the policemen by using gestures , because they had taken away the notebook he normally used to communicate with persons who did not understand sign language .", "CARDINAL . Shortly afterwards the ambulance crew contacted the police station . The officer on duty informed them that no medical aid was necessary , since the applicant 's son was merely intoxicated . He was then placed in the sobering - up room . For a while he kept knocking on the doors and walls but stopped doing so after a while and went to sleep .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the duty officers tried to wake the applicant 's son but he only opened his eyes and , according to the conclusions of the internal investigation of the police , \u201c did not want to wake up \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Approximately TIME after the applicant ' son had been brought to the police station ( at QUANTITY one of the policemen considered that he had been \u201c sleeping for too long \u201d and called an ambulance . The doctors apparently refused to take ORG to a hospital ( during the internal investigation the officers reported that the ambulance crew had indicated that he was \u201c faking \u201d and was healthy ) . The Government dispute that fact , observing that it had not been mentioned in the report on the quality of medical care provided to the applicant 's son ( see below , paragraph CARDINAL ) . Nevertheless , the fact of the ambulance crew 's initial refusal is confirmed by the statements of the police officers who were present at the police station at the time , which have been recounted in several documents , such as the conclusions of the internal inquiry of DATE ( see below , paragraph CARDINAL ) , the report of the additional internal inquiry of CARDINAL DATE ( see below , paragraph CARDINAL ) , the DATE decision to terminate the criminal proceedings ( see below , paragraph CARDINAL ) and others .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's son was taken to hospital only after repeated requests from his father , who had at that time been informed of his son 's arrest and had arrived at the police station . From the reports of the internal investigation it appears that the transfer took place at TIME on DATE . Upon arrival at the hospital it was noted that the applicant 's son was conscious but \u201c non - communicative \u201d . His condition was characterised as \u201c serious \u201d and he was diagnosed with severe intoxication with unknown alcohol surrogates . At CARDINAL p.m. the applicant 's son lost consciousness and his condition was described as \u201c very serious \u201d . At TIME the medical report was updated to note that the presence of an intracranial haematoma could not be excluded but that because of his condition the patient could not be transported for a GPE scan ( which was only available at a hospital in GPE , QUANTITY from FAC ) . The applicant 's son died at CARDINAL a.m. on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A post - mortem examination of the applicant 's son 's body was carried out on DATE . It disclosed fractures of the frontal , parietal and occipital bones of the applicant 's son 's cranium , oedema in the brain as well as multiple other injuries to the head and brain . The expert concluded that those injuries had been the cause of death . It was further established that neither the blood nor the urine of the applicant 's son contained any traces of alcohol .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert of ORG ( \u201c MADEKKI \u201d ) issued a report on the quality of medical aid provided to the applicant 's son before his death . The report noted several shortcomings in the treatment of the applicant 's son at the police station . In particular , it was noted that no information was available concerning the health condition of the applicant 's son during the time spent in the police station or when he was placed in the sobering - up room . It was further concluded that the ambulance had been called to the police station belatedly . The final conclusion of the report was that the death of the applicant 's son was not attributable to any lack of professionalism on behalf of the doctor who had treated him in the hospital but rather to the severity of his injuries .", "CARDINAL . After the death of the applicant 's son ORG launched an internal inquiry . On DATE the final report of the inquiry was approved by the head of that department . The report concluded that the policemen present at the police station during the night in question had acted in accordance with the internal guidelines and the legislation governing police work . The report further referred to an article in the local newspaper in which a surgeon had expressed the opinion that injuries such as the ones sustained by the applicant 's son were difficult to detect , in particular if the injured person was intoxicated . The final conclusion was that the staff of the department had committed no infractions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator of ORG adopted a decision to terminate the criminal proceedings against ORG , which had been initiated on DATE . In this decision several witness testimonies were recounted and some of them seemed to indicate that the security guards who had been on duty during the party at the school had hit the applicant 's son in the head with a rubber truncheon . It was also found that upon the applicant 's son 's arrival at the police station the policemen had noted that he did not have any visible injuries and that he was heavily intoxicated . The decision further remarked that at TIME at the police station a doctor had observed that the applicant 's son was conscious and had no traces of having been hit on his body or head . There was some dried blood in CARDINAL of his nostrils . However , considering that the applicant 's son was deaf and mute and thus unable to communicate orally any complaints about his health , he had been diagnosed as being intoxicated with alcohol surrogates and taken to the FAC hospital . It was further noted that the internal inquiry of FAC had established that the policemen in charge had not committed any offence . Lastly it was established that ORG 's actions did not constitute corpus delicti . Therefore , the criminal proceedings concerning the death of the applicant 's son were terminated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to quash the decision of CARDINAL May and remitted the case for additional investigation . Among other things , the public prosecutor indicated that it was necessary to determine whether it would have been possible to correctly diagnose the applicant 's son 's injuries had he been taken to hospital earlier than he was , whether the police had adequately taken into account the fact that he was deaf and mute , and whether there were any visible external signs of the injuries that eventually caused his death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of ORG approved a report drawn up in the context of an additional internal inquiry that had been prompted by the decision of DATE . Once again no wrongdoings on the part of the police officers were established . In particular , it was noted that even though an internal police instruction concerning sobering - up rooms prohibited the placement therein of persons with visible physical injuries , the applicant 's son did not fall within that category . The report confirmed that his injuries had not been obvious , in that regard referring to the visit of the ambulance crew to the police station at CARDINAL p.m. on DATE , during which no injuries had been noted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC terminated the criminal proceedings for the second time . The decision pointed out , inter alia , that even if the applicant 's son had been taken to hospital sooner , it was not certain that he would have received the correct diagnosis due to the absence of a GPE scanner and a specialist neurologist at FAC hospital . It was also established that since the applicant 's son 's injuries were not visible , the police officers in question had not breached the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC decided to quash the decision of DATE on the ground that the evidence had not been examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC decided to terminate the criminal proceedings . The text of the decision was practically identical to that of DATE .", "CARDINAL . As of DATE the applicant was represented by a lawyer . Pursuant to a request by the applicant 's representative , on DATE a prosecutor of ORG quashed the decision of DATE and sent the case to ORG ( NORP policijas PERSON dro\u0161\u012bbas birojs ) for continued investigation . The decision of DATE focused , inter alia , on the actions of the policemen before and after the applicant 's son 's arrest as well as on the legality and permissibility of his detention as such . It was suggested that the question of the potential liability of the policemen of ORG for criminal inaction ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , see below , paragraph CARDINAL ) needed to be resolved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that ORG decided to split the criminal proceedings into CARDINAL parts , CARDINAL regarding the actions of ORG and the other concerning the inaction of the LOC policemen . The first part was transferred back to FAC and the second remained with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC decided to terminate the criminal proceedings against ORG due to lack of corpus delicti . The applicant did not appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG decided to terminate the criminal proceedings against the officers of LOC for want of corpus delicti . During the course of the investigation statements were taken from all CARDINAL officers who had been present at the police station during TIME of the applicant 's son 's arrest and DATE . The officers who had arrested the applicant 's son confirmed that the security guards at the school had informed them that he had fallen backwards down the stairs but they had not waited for the ambulance that had been called because he had behaved in a way that was typical of an intoxicated person and had had no visible injuries . The officers who had been on duty on DATE pointed out that they had tried to wake up the applicant 's son on several occasions without success , but that after they had eventually succeeded , the applicant 's son had gotten up without any help and walked to the reception area of the police station where he had been seen by a doctor who had arrived in an ambulance . The doctor had then allegedly proclaimed that the applicant 's son was \u201c faking \u201d and was still drunk . He had only been taken to hospital after the applicant had persuaded the doctor to do so . The decision also pointed out that it was \u201c obvious \u201d that a mistake had been made by the doctors , who had failed to correctly diagnose the applicant 's son 's injuries before his death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a public prosecutor of ORG dismissed the applicant 's representative 's appeal against the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a senior prosecutor of the same office rejected the applicant 's representative 's appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . In addition to upholding the conclusions of the decision of CARDINAL DATE , it was pointed out that no causal link existed between the decision of the officers present at the scene to transport the applicant 's son to the police station without waiting for the ambulance and the applicant 's son 's death , since the death had occurred despite the fact that the applicant 's son had eventually been placed under medical supervision .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of DATE a senior prosecutor of ORG attached to ORG dismissed the applicant 's complaint about the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The fifth paragraph of section CARDINAL of the Law on Police provides one of the basic principles for organising the work of the police is safeguarding the health of persons in police custody , which includes carrying out emergency measures to provide medical assistance .
