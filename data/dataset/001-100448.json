The police and prosecuting authorities were afterwards led to suspect that CARDINAL of the vehicles participating in the street race had been used as a getaway car following a ram raid on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On TIME DATE , a police officer contacted the PERSON editorial office by telephone , summoning the editors to surrender to the police all photographic materials concerning the street race of DATE . This police officer was informed by the staff member whom she had called , namely the features chief editor ( chef reportage ) , that this request could not be met as the journalists had only been given permission to take photographs of the street race after having guaranteed the anonymity of the participants in the race .

On behalf of the applicant company , ORG \u2019s editor - in - chief PERSON refused to surrender the photographs , considering this to be contrary to the undertaking given by the journalists to the street race participants as regards their anonymity .", "CARDINAL .

Mr PERSON was told by the public prosecutors that \u201c it concerned a matter of life and death \u201d . No further explanation was given and Mr PERSON \u2019s request for written confirmation that the matter was CARDINAL of \u201c life and death \u201d was not entertained .", "CARDINAL .

The threatened search would entail financial damage for the applicant company as , during DATE , articles were to be prepared for publication on the subject of the wedding of the GPE PERSON , due to take place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , PERSON was arrested on suspicion of having violated LAW . He was not taken to the police station but remained on the applicant company \u2019s LOC . After the GPE public prosecutor had arrived on these LOC and after he had been brought before the prosecutor , Mr PERSON was released at TIME", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company then consulted their counsel , PERSON , and a second lawyer , PERSON , the latter being a specialist in criminal procedure . At some point the CD - ROM was transferred to the ORG offices unbeknown to the public prosecutor and the police investigators . Upon this , the public prosecutor and the other persons involved went to the ORG offices .", "CARDINAL . Mr NORP spoke with the public prosecutors involved for TIME , from TIME . Taking the view that judicial authorisation was required , he sought and obtained the agreement of the public prosecutors to seek the intervention of the duty investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) of ORG ( rechtbank ) , who was then contacted by telephone . After having spoken with PERSON , and after having been briefed by one of the public prosecutors , the investigating judge expressed the view that the needs of the criminal investigation outweighed the applicant company \u2019s journalistic privilege . While recognising from the outset that by law he lacked competence in the matter , he also stated that , had he had the power to do so , he would have been prepared to give an order to that effect and even to sanction a search of the offices .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME , the applicant company , through Mr S. and Mr NORP and under protest , surrendered the CD - ROM containing the photographs to the public prosecutor , who formally seized it . An official receipt issued by a police officer describes it as a CD - ROM in purpose - made packaging , the packaging labelled in handwriting \u201c FAC , ORG [ ORG ] driving simulator , sidecar motorcycle with coffin \u201d . The receipt stated that Mr S. had handed over the CD - ROM under protest .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE a hearing was held before ORG during which the public prosecutor explained why the surrender of the photographs had been found necessary . The summons complained of had been issued in the context of a criminal investigation concerning serious criminals who had pulled cash dispensers out of walls with the aid of a shovel loader , and there was reason to believe that a car used by participants in the street race could lead to the perpetrator(s ) of those robberies .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE ORG granted the request to lift the seizure and to return the CD - ROM to the applicant company as the interests of the investigation did not oppose this . It rejected the remainder of the applicant company \u2019s complaint . It found the seizure lawful and , on this point , considered that a publisher / journalist could not , as such , be regarded as enjoying the privilege of non - disclosure ( verschoningsrecht ) under Article CARDINALa of LAW . Statutorily , the persons referred to in LAW and acknowledged as enjoying the privilege of non - disclosure were , amongst others , public notaries , lawyers and doctors . It considered that the right to freedom of expression , as guaranteed by LAW , included the right freely to gather news ( recht van vrije nieuwsgaring ) which , consequently , deserved protection unless outweighed by another interest warranting priority . It found that , in the instant case , the criminal investigation interest outweighed the right to free gathering of news in that , as explained by the public prosecutor during the hearing , the investigation at issue did not concern the illegal street race , in which context the undertaking of protection of sources had been given , but an investigation into other serious offences . ORG was therefore of the opinion that the case at hand concerned a situation in which the protection of journalistic sources should yield to general investigation interests , the more so as the undertaking to the journalistic source concerned the street race whereas the investigation did not concern that race . It found established that the data stored on the CD - ROM had been used for the investigation of serious offences and that it had been made clear by the prosecutor that these data were relevant to the investigation at issue as all other investigation avenues had led to nothing . It therefore concluded that the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity had been complied with and that the interference had thus been justified . ORG did not find that the seizure had been rash , although more tactful action on the part of the police and the public prosecutor might have prevented the apparent escalation of the matter .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( PERSON ) , which on DATE gave a decision declaring it inadmissible . ORG held that , as ORG had accepted the applicant company \u2019s complaint in so far as it related to the request to lift the seizure and to return the CD - ROM , the applicant company no longer had an interest in its appeal against the ruling of DATE . Referring to its earlier case - law ( ORG , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON ( GPE Law Reports \u2013 \u201c GPE \u201d ) DATE , no . CARDINAL , and ORG , CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , it held that this finding was not altered by the circumstance that the complaint \u2013 apart from a request to return the CD - ROM \u2013 also contained a request to order that any print - outs or copies of the CD - ROM were to be destroyed and that data collected with the aid of the CD - ROM could not be used : neither Article CARDINALa nor any other provision of LAW provided for the possibility of obtaining a declaratory ruling that the seizure or the use of the seized item was unlawful once the item had been returned .", "CARDINAL . The order issued under LAW was closely related to a criminal investigation into a series of ram raids which had taken place on DATE , DATE and DATE .

An interference with the right to freely gather news \u2013 including the interest of protection of a journalistic source \u2013 can be justified under LAW in so far as the conditions set out in that provision have been complied with .

Secondly , the interference must serve CARDINAL of the aims mentioned in LAW . Thirdly , the interference must be necessary in a NORP society for attaining such an aim . In this , the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality play a role . In that framework it must be weighed whether the interference is necessary to serve the interest involved and therefore whether no other , less far - reaching ways ( minder bezwarende wegen ) can be followed along which this interest can be served to a sufficient degree . Where it concerns a criminal investigation , it must be considered whether the interference with the right to freely gather news is proportionate to the interest served in arriving at the truth .
