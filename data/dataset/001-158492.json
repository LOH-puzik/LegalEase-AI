The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE ) . When lodging his application , he was detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of several counts of extortion , robbery , burglary , embezzlement and assault . Applying the criminal law relating to young offenders , it sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . ORG suspended the execution of the sentence and granted probation . In a separate decision of DATE , ORG imposed conditions on the applicant during the probation period , which was to run until DATE . The applicant was not to reoffend ; in addition , he was ordered , inter alia , to complete TIME of unpaid social work .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel informed ORG that he represented the applicant in the proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s probation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a detention order against the applicant , which was confirmed on appeal . The courts found that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed a burglary on CARDINAL May/CARDINAL DATE in a hotel in PERSON . The suspicion was based on the witness statement made by the applicant \u2019s former girl - friend PERSON to the police .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel notified ORG , which received the letter on CARDINAL DATE , that he represented the applicant also in the investigation proceedings concerning the burglary on CARDINAL May/CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested . He was heard on DATE by the investigating judge at ORG , without his counsel being present , on suspicion of having committed the burglary in a hotel on CARDINAL May/CARDINAL DATE in PERSON . The applicant , who had been informed of his rights to remain silent and to consult a defence counsel at any time , admitted having committed the offence described in the detention order of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a hearing before ORG for review of the necessity of his further detention on remand , the applicant , in the presence of his counsel , revoked his confession of DATE . He submitted that he had only admitted having committed the burglary on CARDINAL May/CARDINAL DATE as a police officer had told him at the time of his arrest that he had good chances of being released from detention on remand if he did so .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , ORG charged the applicant with the burglary committed in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , relying on section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , revoked the suspension on probation of the applicant \u2019s prison sentence granted in that court \u2019s judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that in its decision of DATE to suspend the sentence on probation , the applicant had been imposed the condition not to reoffend during the probation period . He had breached that condition as he had confessed having committed a burglary on CARDINAL May/CARDINAL DATE in PERSON . His new offence was similarly serious as the offences he had been convicted of on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG further observed that the applicant had failed to comply with additional conditions imposed in the probation order . In particular , he had not completed the unpaid social work he had been obliged to carry out and had not contacted his probation officer without having a valid excuse .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against ORG decision . He contested the court \u2019s finding that he had reoffended . He stressed , in particular , that he had revoked his confession of CARDINAL DATE . Moreover , a confession alone , the credibility of which had not been tested , was not sufficient to be proved guilty of an offence . In any event , under the standards of NORP law , the revocation of the suspension of a sentence on probation could only be based on a final conviction of a new offence . He had to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision . ORG considered that the revocation of the suspension on probation of the applicant \u2019s prison sentence under LAW of LAW could not be based on the applicant \u2019s failure to carry out the unpaid social work he had been imposed in the probation order because ORG had failed to specify in which institution the applicant was to do that work .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found : \u201c However , ultimately it was nevertheless correct to revoke the suspension on probation as the convicted offender , as ORG had correctly found , committed another offence during the probation period . \u201d ( \u201c PERSON jedoch i m Ergebnis gleichwohl zu ORG erfolgt , denn PERSON , wie das ORG zutreffend angenommen hat , innerhalb der PERSON straff\u00e4llig geworden . \u201c ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG confirmed that the revocation of the suspension of the applicant \u2019s sentence did not require that the applicant had been convicted by a final judgment of the offence on which the revocation was based . It was sufficient that the court revoking the suspension of the sentence had obtained certainty by other means that the person concerned had committed the offence . The presumption of innocence laid down in LAW did not warrant a different conclusion . That presumption only related to proceedings in which a decision on the charges against the accused had to be taken and not to proceedings concerning the revocation of the suspension of a sentence on probation . Referring , in particular , to a decision of ORG of DATE ( see paragraphs DATE below ) , ORG found that it was therefore sufficient , in particular , that the court revoking the suspension on probation of the penalty was convinced that the person concerned was guilty of a new offence on the basis of a credible confession that person made before a judge .", "CARDINAL . In the case before it , ORG then found that in view of the applicant \u2019s confession on DATE before the investigating judge , it was of the \u201c firm conviction that the applicant had again committed an offence \u201d ( \u201c sichere PERSON erneuten PERSON durch den GPE ) , namely a burglary on CARDINAL May/CARDINAL DATE in a hotel in PERSON . The applicant \u2019s confession was credible , in particular , as it was supported by the detailed description of the applicant \u2019s acts before and after the offence given by witness PERSON before the police . The subsequent revocation of the confession by the applicant , who had further contested S. \u2019s statements , arguing that PERSON wanted to take revenge following the breakdown of their relationship , was not credible in the light of the results of the investigations undertaken to date . ORG referred in this respect , in particular , to the reports of the witness statements made by PERSON and by PERSON , an employee of the hotel concerned , before the police . ORG therefore concluded that the applicant had demonstrated by his new offence that he had not fulfilled the expectations on which the suspension of his sentence had been based .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a decision of ORG , the applicant \u2019s detention on remand was interrupted in order for him to serve the sentence imposed on him in ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against the decisions of ORG dated DATE and of ORG dated DATE . He argued , in particular , that the said courts\u2019 finding , on the basis of the case - file alone , that he had committed another burglary had disregarded the rule of law and the presumption of innocence as guaranteed by LAW and by LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW . His initial confession before the investigating judge was irrelevant as he had revoked that confession , the credibility of which had not been tested by the courts revoking the suspension of his sentence on probation . He further took the view that the question whether he had committed a new burglary had to be determined by the competent criminal courts following a trial . The domestic courts\u2019 finding that he had committed another burglary before he had been convicted thereof by a final judgment also disregarded ORG Rights\u2019 findings in a judgment of DATE ( GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without giving reasons , declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of burglary , committed on CARDINAL May/CARDINAL DATE in a hotel in PERSON , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released from prison on CARDINAL DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
