On DATE the regional prosecutor \u2019s office drew up the indictment and committed the applicant and his presumed accomplice for trial before the GPE regional court .", "CARDINAL . The regional court considered the criminal case DATE and DATE . During the proceedings the applicant , who was assisted by a lawyer , submitted that he and his presumed accomplice had indeed been in GPE on DATE and that they had indeed intended to commit a robbery in the bureau de change , but that they had changed their minds and returned to GPE DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE regional court delivered its judgment . The applicant was found guilty of armed robbery in the GPE bureau de change , which crime had been accompanied by the murder of QUANTITY persons and committed with the complicity of GPE He was also found guilty of the unlawful purchase of a pistol and ammunition . The regional court imposed the heaviest sentence available under LAW , namely a whole - life sentence . In accordance with section ORG [ CARDINAL ] of the PERSON on the Execution of Punishments , the regional court ordered the applicant \u2019s placement under the so - called \u201c special \u201d prison regime .", "CARDINAL . Drawing on the evidence gathered during the preliminary investigation and at the hearing , the regional court established the facts as follows : the applicant \u2019s former partner , GPE , had started work as a cashier in the bureau de change in question in DATE when she was still living with the applicant . While working there she had met the first victim , a certain GPE , who was a close relative of the owner and an employee in the same establishment . In DATE PERSON had left the applicant and moved in with GPE in GPE . The applicant had then decided to kill GPE and to steal the cash kept in the bureau de change . He had purchased a \u201c Makarov \u201d pistol , a silencer and ammunition . The applicant had persuaded a friend , GPE , to take part in the robbery . On TIME the applicant and FAC had arrived in GPE by bus . They had then gone to the building in which the bureau de change was located , and had gone up to the top floor to spend TIME . TIME , just before TIME , they had descended to the floor on which the bureau de change was located and noted that GPE was in the LOC alone . GPE , who had been carrying the pistol , had burst into the LOC and fired CARDINAL point - blank shot at the victim \u2019s left temple . The young man had died instantly . The CARDINAL accomplices had then placed the money which they had found in the bureau de change in a bag which they had brought with them . Meanwhile the armed security guard of the bureau de change , a certain GPE , had rushed into the LOC where the first victim had been killed . GPE had fired QUANTITY shots at him , hitting him in the face . The security guard had been killed instantly . GPE and the applicant had left the building . They had then concealed the murder weapon under a rubbish bin , thrown away the clothes they had been wearing and hidden the stolen money . Some time later the CARDINAL men had ordered a certain FAC to fetch the money for them , which he had done .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against that judgment . He complained that insufficient reasons had been given for the conviction , that his guilt had not been established , that the first - instance court had reached an erroneous decision , that there had been several breaches of the procedural and substantive rules under domestic law and that the regional court had shown bias .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer requested the withdrawal of all the judges of ORG . He argued that the media coverage of the criminal case had created a climate of intolerance and hostility towards his client . The defence called for an additional witness to be summoned , the re - examination of CARDINAL of the witnesses already questioned by the court of first instance , and several additional expert opinions . On DATE the judge - rapporteur responsible for the criminal case rejected the requests for further evidence - gathering as irrelevant . He dismissed the challenge to the judges of ORG for lack of evidence of bias .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered the criminal case DATE . It questioned a new witness and received additional conclusions from psychiatric experts on the mental state of the CARDINAL accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of the court of first instance , giving its full backing to the latter \u2019s factual and legal findings . The evidence gathered during the preliminary investigation , presented before the court of first instance and produced for the first time before ORG had demonstrated that the CARDINAL accused had planned and carried out the robbery in the bureau de change and that the CARDINAL victims had been killed by FAC Yet the applicant had been the instigator of those murders and had provided the weapon used by his accomplice . ORG drew on the depositions of the many witnesses questioned during the assessment of the case , on the results of the ballistic , technical and NORP reports and the medical and psychiatric opinions , and also on the material and documentary evidence gathered .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal observed that the accused \u2019s initial depositions during the preliminary investigation had differed considerably from their submissions to the court of first instance . The initial depositions had corroborated the finding concerning their participation in committing the criminal offences in issue , whereas the subsequent ones set out a version of events to the effect that an NORP national had committed those offences . ORG gave credence to the accused \u2019s initial depositions , which had been made to an investigator in their ORG presence after they had been formally charged . The CARDINAL individuals thus charged had been advised that their statements could be used in court with a view to establishing the facts , and their prior medical examination had revealed no sign of physical violence , which contradicted the defence lawyer \u2019s allegation that the applicant \u2019s initial confession had been extracted from him .", "CARDINAL . ORG turned its attention to the applicant \u2019s version of events stating that the CARDINAL murders and the robbery had been committed by a certain PERSON , an NORP national , and that the applicant himself had been at his place of work in GPE at the material time . Verifications carried out in the ORG database had shown that no NORP national of that name was present in GPE . It was true that the applicant had been at his place of work in GPE on DATE . However , he had been working as a night watchman and the robbery and murders had been committed early in the morning , which had given him enough time to cover the distance between GPE and GPE and to arrive at work TIME . ORG deemed unconvincing the statement by the only witness who had corroborated the applicant \u2019s version of events .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the judgment of the court of first instance displayed none of the procedural defects mentioned by the defence . The factual and legal findings of the regional court had not been exclusively based on the accused \u2019s confessions but on the whole body of consistent evidence gathered during the criminal proceedings . The applicant had participated actively in the proceedings and his lawyers had submitted several requests linked to the progress of the trial and the gathering of evidence . The regional court had responded to all those requests and had provided full reasons for its procedural decisions . There had been no sign of bias on the part of the judges who had examined the case , and the proceedings had been conducted in such a way as to safeguard the parties\u2019 interests .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal excluded a statement by CARDINAL witness from the evidence for non - compliance with the procedural rules , but did not consider that statement decisive in terms of the factual and legal conclusions in the case . The problem was that the regional court had been dilatory in issuing its grounds of judgment . However , the defence had been able to submit additional observations on appeal after having secured a copy of the grounds of judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , reiterating his submissions to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . That court found that none of the circumstances mentioned by the defence demonstrated the existence of bias on the part of the judges who had considered the criminal case . The applicant had had an opportunity to defend himself effectively during the criminal proceedings : he had given evidence and challenged the evidence against him . Some of his requests for further evidence - gathering had been accepted by the lower - level courts , and proper reasons had been given for their rejection of other evidential requests as mentioned by the defence .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in adopting the appeal court \u2019s other arguments , ORG considered that the facts had been well established , that the substantive and procedural legislation had been appropriately applied and that the accused \u2019s rights had been fully respected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was held in ORG from DATE to DATE , and again from DATE to DATE . He was incarcerated in FAC from DATE to DATE , and again from DATE to DATE . On DATE he was transferred to FAC , where he is still being held .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that he had been held in a cell without window , toilets or running water . The LOC had had poor ventilation and lighting . He had not been allowed to exercise in the open air . Access to sanitation had been restricted and the time allowed for washing had been insufficient . The applicant emphasised that the conditions of hygiene in the detention facility had been deplorable . He had subsequently been moved to another cell with CARDINAL other detainees . The CARDINAL detainees had had to take turns sleeping because the cell only had one bench .", "CARDINAL . According to a rapport by the Director General of Prisons submitted by the ORG , at the time the only furniture in the cells in ORG had been a bench . The cells had had no windows and the only daylight had entered through holes in metal plates affixed to the doors . The facility in question had only had CARDINAL shared toilet and bathroom and lacked any open - air facilities for detainees . The rapport also mentioned that DATE the facility had been completely renovated and redeveloped to bring the conditions of detention into line with the GPE human dignity .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that his cell in FAC had had a surface area of QUANTITY . It had contained a bed and a metal rack . There had been neither running water nor toilets in his cell . He had used a plastic bucket for his bodily functions . Like all the prisoners he was allowed out of his cell for TIME CARDINAL times a day , in order to empty the bucket and fill his water bottle . The applicant submitted , in support of those allegations , a statement by his co - accused GPE , who had been detained with him under the same conditions in FAC . The applicant added that he had been forced to wear a convict \u2019s uniform even though he should have been allowed to wear his own clothes , under the prison rules .", "CARDINAL . The applicant explained that at the beginning of his term in FAC he had been deprived of open - air exercise . According to ORG statement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , prisoners were allowed TIME open - air exercise every other day . The applicant was not involved in any organised activity in FAC . He had submitted several requests to the prison authorities to allow him to join in the various vocational training and occupational programmes and had applied for a transfer to FAC in order to be closer to his family , but no action had ever been taken on his requests .", "CARDINAL . According to a report by the Director of ORG submitted by the Government , the applicant had problems adapting to the prison regulations ; his attitude to the wardens and the prison authorities had been refractory and disrespectful . However , the applicant had enjoyed all the rights afforded to persons deprived of their liberty . He had board and lodging in accordance with normal prison standards . He had open - air exercise every day and free access to the prison library . He had consulted a psychologist on several occasions and had had a number of meetings with the official responsible for activities in the prison .", "CARDINAL . Following his transfer to FAC the applicant had been subject to a \u201c special \u201d prison regime involving virtually total isolation from the rest of the prison population .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that over the period from DATE he had been confined to a cell measuring CARDINAL x QUANTITY which he had shared with another prisoner . The CARDINAL beds had taken up most of the floor area , leaving the QUANTITY prisoners with a free area of QUANTITY . There had been no running water in the cell and the prisoners had used a bucket as a toilet .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant stated that he had spent most of the day sitting on his bed for lack of free space in the cell . He had eaten his meals in the cell and had been allowed to walk in the prison yard for TIME every day . His access to the prison library had been limited to TIME it took to choose and borrow a book , after which he had been immediately taken back to his cell . He had been allowed to attend the prison chapel twice a year , at GPE and DATE , although not during worship so that he would not meet other prisoners .", "CARDINAL . The applicant added that up until DATE , the high - security wing of the prison had been overcrowded and ill prisoners had not been held separately from other prisoners , which had fostered the transmission of infectious diseases . Material conditions had improved somewhat after the works in the high - security wing in DATE and DATE . In DATE , his prison regime had been relaxed . However , like all prisoners in his category , he had still been kept separate from the rest of the prison population and his cell had been kept locked during DATE . In DATE and DATE he had occasionally worked in his cell folding envelopes . Since DATE he has been allowed into an activities room where he can talk to other life prisoners and read books .", "CARDINAL . According to a report by the Director of PERSON dated DATE , the high - security wing of FAC had been completely renovated in DATE and DATE . On the date of the report in question the applicant had been held in an individual cell measuring QUANTITY and containing a bed , a table , a rack , a shower and private toilets . His cell had been heated and had running water and proper lighting .", "CARDINAL . Apart from the restrictions imposed by his prison regime , the applicant benefited from all the activities provided to other prisoners : he could work , visit the library and the prison chapel , receive visits from his relatives , write and receive letters . He was also eligible for relaxation of his prison regime under section CARDINAL of LAW , subject to a favourable opinion from the relevant special commission , and could ultimately be accommodated with the rest of the prison population .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in DATE the applicant applied for the annulment of a number of the provisions of the implementing regulations of LAW concerning the manner and method of execution of his life sentence . His application was finally dismissed by a judgment of DATE delivered by ORG , which found that the challenged provisions of the implementing regulations were not contrary to LAW and that the adoption of the regulations had not involved any irregularities justifying their annulment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , while in FAC , the applicant began a hunger strike in protest against the authorities\u2019 refusal to transfer him to FAC . He was monitored by the prison medical team while on hunger strike . In DATE his state of health worsened and he was transferred , on the initiative of the prison authorities , to FAC hospital . On recovery he returned to FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was taken to FAC hospital . Medical examinations revealed that he was suffering from tuberculosis . He received medicinal treatment at the hospital until DATE . He subsequently asked the prison authorities to allow him to take more exercise in the open air , which request was rejected . The applicant submitted that he had been unable to obtain a diet suited to his state of health either during or after his treatment in the prison hospital .", "CARDINAL . According to the CARDINAL DATE report by the Director of PERSON , after his stay in the prison hospital in DATE the applicant had been given regular medical examinations and biological control analyses .
