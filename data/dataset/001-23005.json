AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant is the ORG , a limited liability company with its seat in GPE ( GPE ) . It is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the owner and publisher of the DATE magazine \u201c News \u201d .", "In its issue no CARDINAL/CARDINAL the magazine published articles reporting on a planned demonstration against racism and the ORG \u2019s policy , and articles about Mr PERSON , ORG and , at that time , Chairman of ORG ( ORG ) , commenting , inter alia , on his role in the ongoing process of the creation of the new ORG ( Bundesregierung ) after the election of ORG ( PERSON ) in DATE . On the front page it placed a photomontage picturing PERSON symbolising the devil : horns attached to a bald head on a blazing red background . This picture was accompanied by the following text sequences :", "\u201c Arch - enemy PERSON , how he plans to come into power \u201d and", "\u201c The Demonstration : Who opposes him \u201d and", "\u201c How he further tries to set fire \u201d", "On DATE Mr PERSON brought compensation proceedings against the applicant company claiming compensation under section CARDINAL of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) for defamation . He argued that the photomontage , picturing him as devil , constituted offences under LAW . Further he requested supplementary measures under LAW , such as the publication of a notice that proceedings under LAW had been opened and the publication of the judgment .", "On DATE the ORG ( PERSON ) , without having held a hearing , ordered the applicant company to publish the following notice :", "\u201c Notice pursuant to sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) LAW :", "In its issue CARDINAL from CARDINAL DATE the periodical \u2018 News\u2019 published on the front page a portrayal of the claimant as devil . Alongside the following headlines were published : \u2018 Arch - enemy PERSON , how he plans to come into power\u2019 ; \u2018 The Demonstration : Who opposes him.\u2019 ; and \u2018 How he further tries to set fire.\u2019", "The claimant Dr. PERSON filed an application under LAW because of this front page against the defendant , the Verlagsgruppe News GmbH.", "The proceedings are pending . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant company filed an appeal . It stressed that the photomontage on the front page had to be considered in connection with the articles in the magazine , in which it had reported on a planned demonstration and its supporters against the ORG \u2019s and Mr PERSON \u2019s policy , against racism in general and against Mr PERSON \u2019s political position . Further it submitted that the photomontage was easily recognisable as a caricature and that the fundamental message of the publication had been that PERSON PERSON was the \u201c political arch - enemy \u201d for many NORP people . The impugned publication had therefore been a value judgment . Finally , the applicant company referred to the ORG \u2019s PERSON v. GPE judgment ( no.CARDINAL ) of CARDINAL DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , in which the ORG found that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider with regard to a politician acting in his public capacity than in relation to a private individual .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal .", "On DATE the ORG , after having held a hearing , sentenced the applicant company to a fine of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ordered it to publish this judgment in its magazine . It found that the average reader had related the photomontage to the negative characteristics of the devil . The incriminated publication had constituted a debasing denunciation as Mr PERSON had been equated with the evil . However , no factual basis could have been deduced from the accompanying headlines .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , after having held a hearing , partly allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law and fact ( GPE wegen PERSON ) and the appeal against sentence ( GPE wegen PERSON ) and reduced the fine to ORG CARDINAL . It found that the incriminated publication did not constitute an equalisation with the character of the devil . However , it was placed as eye - catcher on the front page and constituted a striking exposure of Mr PERSON , in which he was described as debased and publicly ridiculed . Further it found that the photomontage could not be regarded as a caricature . Although the limits of acceptable criticism were wider with regard to a politician acting in his public capacity than in relation to a private individual , defamation was prohibited . Balancing Mr PERSON \u2019s personal interest against the rights of the applicant company under LAW , it found that a politician too was entitled to have his reputation protected , particularly if the debasing picture , taking into account its luridness , had served primarily the company \u2019s business interests ( the issue CARDINAL/CARDINAL of the magazine \u201c News \u201d reached the highest sales volume ever ) . In this case it found that the personal interest in protecting a person \u2019s reputation outweighed the right secured by LAW as the emphasis of the publication was put on the personal insulting statement . Therefore , the court concluded that the objective elements of the offence of defamation within the meaning of LAW of LAW had been met . Referring to the LAW v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL ) , it found that the photomontage on the front page had to be considered separately from the reports in the magazine as , in any case , its impact had overlaid all potential factual references . The accompanying headlines had not provided a factual basis for the incriminated photomontage and freedom of expression could not justify the personal insulting statement committed by the publication .", "According to LAW , compensation claims may be made either in criminal proceedings against the publisher or , failing such criminal proceedings , in separate proceedings .", "If a publication in the media , viewed objectively , constitutes , inter alia , an insult under LAW of LAW , the insulted person may claim compensation for non - pecuniary damages from the media owner , pursuant to section LAW .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Anyone who , in public or in the presence of several others , insults , mocks , mistreats or threatens to mistreat a third person , shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding DATE or a fine ... unless he is liable to a more severe penalty under another provision . ... \u201d", "Upon request of the insulted person under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , the competent court has to order the publication of a notice to the effect , that compensation proceedings under LAW are pending , if it is to be presumed that the requirements for compensation will be met . If the defendant does not comply with the order to publish the notice , the plaintiff may request the court to impose a fine which can not exceed ATS CARDINAL per published edition of the defendant \u2019s magazine ( section QUANTITY of LAW ) .", "In the case of an insulting statement , the amount of damages payable can not exceed ORG CARDINAL ( section QUANTITY of LAW ) . When fixing the amount to be awarded , the competent court has to give particular consideration to the effect of the insulting publication and the economic situation of the media company ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
