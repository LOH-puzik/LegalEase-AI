GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The application was lodged by the association ORG e . ORG , represented by PERSON , and CARDINAL other applicants . The applicants Ms GPE , GPE , PERSON , and PERSON are NORP nationals who were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and Mr PERSON , all lawyers practising in GPE .", "The applicant association has its business office , and the other CARDINAL applicants live or lived , close to busy roads and intersections in GPE .", "On DATE the applicants requested ORG and Drivers ( PERSON ) to take specific measures designed to curb respirable car dust emissions of diesel vehicles . The applicants requested ORG and Drivers to :", "threaten the car manufacturers with withdrawal of the general operating licence ( PERSON ) for certain diesel vehicles unless they recalled the cars in question and equipped them with particulate filters within a reasonable time - limit ;", "revoke the general operating licence after the time - limit for the retrofitting had expired ; and", "refuse to issue the general operating licence for diesel vehicles if the cars exceeded a certain critical limit of particles .", "On DATE ORG and Drivers rejected the request . It held that the general operating licenses were issued in accordance with NORP and NORP legislation . On DATE ORG and Drivers dismissed an administrative objection by the applicant , holding that there was no legal basis for an obligation to install particulate filters .", "On DATE the applicants lodged an action with the administrative courts .", "On DATE the Schleswig - Holstein Administrative Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 action in its entirety . It held that the applicant association \u2019s action was inadmissible since ORG e . PERSON lacked the right to sue in the present case . The applicant association could not claim any right ; in particular , it could not rely on a right to be protected from a health impairment . With respect to the other CARDINAL applicants , ORG declared the action admissible , holding that they could rely on a positive obligation of the ORG emanating from their constitutional right to life and physical integrity . On the merits it found that the ORG authorities enjoyed a wide latitude and were only under an obligation to take measures of a kind that could not be said to be wholly inappropriate or insufficient for the protection of ORG rights . Referring to environmental reports submitted by the applicants , the court accepted that the particles were dangerous for the human organism but held that the NORP legislature was cognisant of the problem of respirable dust particles and , in accordance with ORG ( GPE ) legislation , had taken measures to curb such emissions . It added that the authorities were constantly monitoring the situation and had already announced further plans to tighten emission limits . The ORG had a general interest in the limitation of car emissions being harmonised at ORG level . ORG accepted that particulate filters were a very effective measure to curb emissions , but noted that other possible means included , for example , tax incentives for low - emission cars or road - traffic related measures . It concluded that the wide latitude available to the ORG to comply with its positive obligation had in the present case not been narrowed down to such an extent that the ORG authorities were under an obligation to take the specific measures requested by the applicants .", "On DATE ORG confirmed that ORG . PERSON lacked the right to sue . It rejected , in particular , the applicant association \u2019s argument that the right to sue could be deduced from the fact that ORG , as an employer , was responsible for the health of its employees . On the merits ORG upheld the reasoning of ORG . It held that the ORG \u2019s positive obligation did not compel ORG authorities to take the measures the applicants had requested ; it was for the legislature and not the judiciary to decide on the appropriate ceiling on respirable dust emissions . The NORP legislature had met the requirements emanating from its positive obligation when implementing the critical values required under the NORP directives .", "On DATE ORG , without giving any reasons , refused to admit the constitutional complaint lodged by the applicants ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
