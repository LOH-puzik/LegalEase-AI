QUANTITY away is the Enichem agricoltura company \u2019s chemical factory , which lies within the municipality of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the factory , which produced fertilisers and caprolactam ( a chemical compound producing , by a process of polycondensation , a polyamide used in the manufacture of synthetic fibres such as nylon ) , was classified as \u201c high risk \u201d according to the criteria set out in Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c ORG CARDINAL \u201d ) , which transposed into NORP law Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of ORG ( the \u201c Seveso \u201d directive ) on the major - accident hazards of certain industrial activities dangerous to the environment and the well - being of the local population .", "CARDINAL . The applicants said that in the course of its production cycle the factory released large quantities of inflammable gas \u2013 a process which could have led to explosive chemical reactions , releasing highly toxic substances \u2013 and sulphur dioxide , nitric oxide , sodium , ammonia , metal hydrides , benzoic acid and above all , arsenic trioxide . These assertions have not been disputed by the Government .", "CARDINAL . Accidents due to malfunctioning have already occurred in the past , the most serious CARDINAL on DATE when the scrubbing tower for the ammonia synthesis gases exploded , allowing several tonnes of potassium carbonate and bicarbonate solution , containing arsenic trioxide , to escape . CARDINAL people were admitted to hospital with acute arsenic poisoning .", "CARDINAL . In a report of CARDINAL DATE a committee of technical experts appointed by ORG established that because of the factory \u2019s geographical position , emissions from it into the atmosphere were often channelled towards PERSON . It was noted in the report that the factory had refused to allow the committee to carry out an inspection and that the results of a study by the factory itself showed that the emission treatment equipment was inadequate and the environmental - impact assessment incomplete .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the factory restricted its activity to the production of fertilisers , and it was accordingly still classified as a dangerous factory covered by ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL . In DATE ORG issued an order jointly with ORG prescribing measures to be taken by the factory to improve the safety of the ongoing fertiliser production , and of caprolactam production if that was resumed ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the factory permanently stopped producing fertiliser . Only a thermoelectric power station and plant for the treatment of feed and waste water continued to operate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL residents of PERSON ( including the applicants ) applied to ORG ( pretore ) complaining that the air had been polluted by emissions of unknown chemical composition and toxicity from the factory .

Most of the defendants escaped a prison sentence , either because the charges were covered by an amnesty or were time - barred , or because they had paid an immediate fine ( oblazione ) . CARDINAL directors were sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of MONEY and ordered to pay damages to the civil parties , for having had waste dumps built without prior permission , contrary to the relevant provisions of ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL on waste disposal .", "CARDINAL . On appeals by the CARDINAL directors who had been convicted and by ORG ( ORG ) and ORG , which had both joined the proceedings as civil parties claiming damages , ORG acquitted the directors on DATE on the ground that the offence had not been made out but upheld the remainder of the impugned decision . The court held that the errors which the directors were alleged to have made in the management of the waste were in fact attributable to delays and uncertainties in the adoption and interpretation , particularly by ORG , of regulations implementing ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL . Consequently , there was no damage that gave rise to a claim for compensation .", "CARDINAL . A joint committee of representatives from the ORG and GPE was set up within ORG to implement the ORG directive .", "The committee ordered a technical survey , which was carried out by a panel established by an order of the Minister for the Environment of DATE .

The latter published its conclusions on DATE and fixed CARDINAL DATE as the date on which the report required by LAW ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the risk of major accidents should be submitted to the Minister for ORG . It also recommended :", "( a ) commissioning studies of the factory \u2019s safety and compatibility with its environment , additional analyses of disaster scenarios and of the preparation and implementation of emergency procedures ;", "( b ) introducing a number of changes designed to reduce the atmospheric emissions drastically and to improve the treatment of waste water , making radical alterations to the production cycles for urea and nitrogen and carrying out studies on the pollution of the subsoil and on the hydrogeological structure of the factory site . These steps were to be taken within DATE .

On DATE ORG and ORG jointly adopted conclusions on the factory \u2019s safety report of DATE , as required by LAW ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL . Those conclusions prescribed a number of improvements to be made to the installations , both in relation to fertiliser production and in the event of resumed caprolactam production ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and provided the prefect with instructions as to the emergency plan for which he was responsible and the measures required for informing the local population under LAW ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "In a letter of DATE to ORG , however , the mayor of ORG indicated that the investigation for the purpose of drawing up conclusions under LAW was still continuing and that he had not received any documents relating to them . He pointed out that ORG was still awaiting direction from ORG before deciding what safety measures should be taken and what procedures should be followed in the event of an accident and communicated to the public . He said that if the factory resumed production , the measures for informing the public would be taken as soon as the conclusions based on the investigation were available .", "CARDINAL . As regards the obligation to inform the public on matters of environmental and public safety , LAW provides that any undertaking carrying on dangerous activities must submit a report to ORG and ORG giving details of , among other things , its activities , emergency procedures in the event of a major accident , the persons responsible for carrying these procedures out , and the measures taken by the undertaking to reduce the risks to the environment and public health .

Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provided that data and information on industrial activities obtained pursuant to ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL could be used only for the purposes for which they had been requested .", "That provision was partly amended by Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE . LAW of that decree provides for an exception to the ban on disclosure of industrial secrets in the case of certain information , namely that contained in an information sheet which the undertaking must complete and send to ORG and the regional or inter - regional technical committee . Mayors\u2019 duties with regard to informing the public are unchanged and now appear in paragraph CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL also lays certain obligations on the prefect in the matter of providing information .
