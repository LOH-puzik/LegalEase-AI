The facts of the case , particularly concerning events on or CARDINAL November CARDINAL when the gendarmes carried out an operation at ORG , were disputed by the parties . The Commission , pursuant to former LAW ( a ) of the LAW , conducted an investigation with the assistance of the parties .", "The Commission heard witnesses in GPE on DATE . These included the applicant ; PERSON her son ; and PERSON , a villager . ORG also had regard to the oral evidence given by witnesses on CARDINAL and DATE in the case of PERSON ( see PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-IV ) , which concerned the same operation . This included the testimony of PERSON , whose brother had disappeared after being taken into custody by the gendarmes ; PERSON , a villager and spouse of the disappeared person ; PERSON , previously muhtar of the village ; PERSON the gendarme commander of the operation ; and PERSON , a villager .", "CARDINAL . The DATE \u2019s findings of fact are set out in its report of DATE and summarised below ( Section A ) . The applicant accepts the ORG \u2019s findings of fact . The Government \u2019s submissions concerning the facts are summarised below ( Section B ) .", "CARDINAL . \u00c7itlibah\u00e7e was in a district in which terrorist activity was intense in DATE . The ORG used to come to the village , holding meetings and taking food by force . The security forces made regular visits and operations were not uncommon . They told the villagers not to give food to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , PERSON and PERSON all recalled an incident in DATE when villagers were forced by the security forces to pull up their tobacco crops . Although there was some disparity amongst the witnesses as to how this was done , the ORG accounts were similar in stating that the tobacco crops were destroyed by order of the security forces . The gendarme commander who gave evidence before the Delegates denied that this occurred but recalled that he had destroyed hemp crops . ORG did not make any finding in regard of this aspect as it was not the subject - matter of any specific complaint .", "CARDINAL . Shortly before DATE , ORG terrorists went to the village of PERSON in the NORP district and took away CARDINAL teachers , the imam and the imam \u2019s brother . All , save CARDINAL of the teachers , were shot . The imam \u2019s brother , though wounded , survived .", "CARDINAL . Following the discovery of the bodies of the teachers , the gendarmes at ORG gathered information from their contacts and sources as to what had happened and who had been involved . They had descriptions of the villagers in the area who had been assisting the ORG in holding the group of teachers . On DATE , an operation , under the command of PERSON , was carried out by the ORG gendarmes in ORG , while gendarmes from ORG went to GPE nearby .", "CARDINAL . Concerning what happened during the operation at ORG , ORG had earlier found PERSON to be an evasive witness , with a volubly unhelpful response to questioning . They found a lack of sincerity in the way in which he drowned simple questions in long and complicated explanations , which were often contradictory and inconsistent . On the other hand , the Delegates had found that the villagers , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , who gave eyewitness accounts , were on the whole consistent and credible and that they were convincing in their demeanour and their response to questions . Their evidence was found to support the testimony of the witnesses heard in this case . In this regard , ORG Delegates found the applicant to be a convincing witness , an elderly , simple and unsophisticated lady who was on the whole credible . Her oral testimony was largely consistent with the statement given by her to ORG shortly after the incident . While there were some inconsistencies in her accounts , the Commission considered that they could be attributed to the applicant \u2019s advanced DATE and the passage of time since the events in question . Her evidence accorded in essentials with that of her son PERSON and the villager PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found that the ORG gendarmes included ORG in the operation since they intended to look for and take into custody PERSON , who , as a person already under suspicion of involvement in ORG activities , would be likely to have information about the kidnap group that passed through the village .", "CARDINAL . When the gendarmes arrived at the village , TIME , they left their vehicles outside and entered . They gathered the men together in CARDINAL place and the women in another . PERSON had hidden . A search was carried out by the gendarmes , who also started setting fire to houses . PERSON was found and taken into custody . He was last seen by the witnesses being taken by village guards and soldiers to the vehicles .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had gone into her house when she saw all the soldiers but had been forced to leave by the soldiers . They set fire to her house , which had CARDINAL rooms and was made of timber . The family stored provisions , crops and wheat inside and these , along with the furniture and other household goods , were destroyed . CARDINAL houses in the village were burned down . She stated that once they had caught PERSON the gendarmes left . After the departure of the gendarmes , the village was left in ruins and villagers were forced to leave .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the evidence as a whole , the ORG accepted the evidence of the applicant as regards its principal elements . It did not find the matters referred to by the ORG as being indicative of bad faith or as materially undermining the credibility and reliability of the applicant and her witnesses , which its Delegates assessed in generally positive terms . While the ORG took note of the applicant \u2019s age , its Delegates had not found any indication of mental infirmity that would cast doubt on her ability to give evidence .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found in conclusion that the applicant \u2019s property , furniture and possessions were deliberately burnt and destroyed during an operation by security forces in the village of ORG on DATE . This led to the evacuation of the village . The possessions burned included a fridge , television , kitchen utensils , household goods , and produce ( including tobacco , wheat , barley , lentils , and DATE provisions ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and other villagers went to ORG after the operation . Accompanied by her son and CARDINAL other villagers , the applicant went to ORG . She made a statement and thumbprinted it .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the applicant was summoned to a police station . In his evidence to the Delegates , her son , PERSON remembered that she had been summoned to the public prosecutor \u2019s office in DATE . He accompanied her there . She had been asked to make a statement . The public prosecutor read out of a file , stating that she had complained to LOC about GPE . He told the Delegates that he thought the prosecutor was trying to put pressure on his mother .", "CARDINAL . The Government emphasised the terrorism which was prevalent in this region from DATE and created a public danger threatening the life of the nation . The ORG had killed CARDINAL of innocent victims and exerted intolerable pressure on the local population . The operation in this case concerned an investigation into the kidnapping and killing of teachers and an imam .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had made no complaint to the public prosecutor about the alleged burning of her house and property by the gendarmes during the operation on DATE . She only made a statement to the public prosecutor when he summoned her after the case was communicated to the Government by the Commission . He issued a decision of non - jurisdiction , transferring the file to the ORG governor . ORG began an investigation and found that her claims were unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the applicant \u2019s various accounts , oral and written , were inconsistent and implausible , in particular the details purportedly noted down by ORG in her application to the Commission .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Government submitted a copy of the statement taken by the ORG public prosecutor from the applicant via an interpreter on DATE . This had not been provided to the Commission .", "CARDINAL . According to the statement , thumbprinted by the applicant , the letter from ORG , the appended documents and the application to the Commission were read out to her through an interpreter and she was asked about them . She acknowledged that the thumbprint on the document was hers and that she did not remember who took the statement . As regarded the events , she could not remember the exact date but DATE before CARDINAL or more army vehicles had come to ORG , with soldiers and village guards . They rounded up the villagers and set fire to the houses . After the village burned down , she went to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The statement recorded that she was shown the application and letter of authority and asked about them . She stated the thumbprints were hers . She said that she thought her application was going to GPE to claim her rights . She was illiterate and ignorant and did not know anything about NORP human rights . She made her statement to them as she thought this would get something done about the damage which she had suffered . She wanted the ORG to vindicate her rights . She did not want to start a case in LOC in the way that he < the public prosecutor > had explained and did not agree to foreign lawyers starting such a case . It was for the ORG to look after her rights . When she made a statement to the ORG , there had been a lot of people with her and they described the events also . The application which had been read out was accurate though and she had no complaints to make about the person who wrote it down . She had not started any court case in ORG or ORG as she was poor and ignorant and did not know what to do .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c All acts or decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review ...", "The administration shall be liable to indemnify any damage caused by its own acts and measures . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The above provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war . The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration , whose responsibility is of an absolute , objective nature , based on a concept of collective liability and referred to as the theory of \u201c social risk \u201d . Thus the administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the ORG may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety , or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property .", "CARDINAL . The principle of administrative liability is reflected in the additional LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE on ORG , which provides :", "\u201c ... actions for compensation in relation to the exercise of the powers conferred by this PERSON are to be brought against the administration before the administrative courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

For all these offences complaints may be lodged , pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities . The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them , the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated , pursuant to LAW . A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . If the suspected authors of the contested acts are military personnel , they may also be prosecuted for causing extensive damage , endangering human lives or damaging property , if they have not followed orders in conformity with Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the Military Code . Proceedings in these circumstances may be initiated by the persons concerned ( non - military ) before the competent authority under LAW , or before the suspected ORG hierarchical superior ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL on the LAW and Procedure of Military Courts ) .", "CARDINAL . If the alleged author of a crime is an agent of the ORG , permission to prosecute must be obtained from local administrative councils ( ORG of ORG ) . The local council decisions may be appealed to ORG ; a refusal to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal of this kind .", "CARDINAL . Any illegal act by civil servants , be it a crime or a tort , which causes material or moral damage may be the subject of a claim for compensation before the ordinary civil courts .", "CARDINAL . Proceedings against the administration may be brought before the administrative courts , whose proceedings are in writing .", "CARDINAL . Damage caused by terrorist violence may be compensated out of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Extensive powers have been granted to the Regional Governor of ORG by decrees enacted under PERSON no . CARDINAL on ORG ( DATE ) , especially Decree no . CARDINAL , as amended by Decrees nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and Decree no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Decree no . CARDINAL modifies the application of PERSON no . ORG , the Anti - Terror Law ( DATE ) , in those areas which are subject to the state of emergency , with the effect that the decision to prosecute members of the security forces is removed from the public prosecutor and conferred on local administrative councils . These councils are made up of civil servants and are under the authority of the provincial governors who also head the security forces .", "CARDINAL . DATE of Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE provides as follows :", "\u201c No criminal , financial or legal responsibility may be claimed against ORG or a NORP Governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers entrusted to them by this decree , and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to this end . This is without prejudice to the rights of individuals to claim indemnity from the ORG for damage suffered by them without justification . \u201d", "According to the applicant , this Article grants impunity to the Governors and reinforces the powers of the Regional Governor to order the permanent or temporary evacuation of villages , to impose residence restrictions and to enforce the transfer of people to other areas . Damage caused in the context of the fight against terrorism would be \u201c with justification \u201d and therefore immune from suit ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
