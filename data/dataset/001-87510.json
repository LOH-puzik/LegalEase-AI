Early in DATE the applicant began to suspect that her colleagues were aware of her illness . At that time hospital staff had free access to the patient register which contained information on ORG diagnoses and treating doctors . Having confided her suspicions to her doctor in DATE , the hospital \u2019s register was amended so that henceforth only the treating clinic \u2019s personnel had access to its ORG records . The applicant was registered in the patient register under a false name . Apparently later her identity was changed once again and she was given a new social security number .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant changed her job as her temporary contract was not renewed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant complained to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninhallitus , l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) , requesting it to examine who had accessed her confidential patient record . Upon request , the director in charge of the hospital \u2019s archives filed a statement with ORG , according to which it was not possible to find out who , if anyone , had accessed the applicant \u2019s patient record as the data system revealed CARDINAL most recent consultations ( by working unit and not by person ) and even this information was deleted once the file was returned to the archives .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE ORG held that :", "\u201c LAW ( laki potilaan asemasta ja oikeuksista , lag om patientens st\u00e4llning och r\u00e4ttigheter ) provides that the health authorities and staff have to comply with the regulations issued by ORG ( sosiaali- ja terveysministeri\u00f6 , social- och h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rdsministeriet , \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) when preparing and processing patient records .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . According to the duty to take care , precaution and good registering practices must be observed when gathering , depositing , using and delivering data and these must be done in a manner so as not to infringe unnecessarily the right to privacy of the registered person or his or her benefits and rights . The protection obligation means that data in patient records must be duly protected against unauthorised processing , use , destruction , amendment and theft ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "In the said Regulation it is also noted that the patient records must form an entity to ensure that outsiders can not gain unauthorised access to them and that , in addition to the said obligations , in accordance with LAW , the purpose of use of the said data can be taken into account . This way it can be made sure that requisite patient data are only given to the personnel participating in the treatment of the patient .", "[ The applicant ] has in her representations alleged that [ X ] , who is working for [ the hospital ] has ordered up the case history of [ the applicant \u2019s ex - husband ] and that someone else has ordered up her file or visited the archives and read her file and/or that of [ her son ] and that the data have been transmitted to [ Y ] and other staff mentioned in [ the applicant \u2019s ] representations .", "[ X ] has contested having proceeded erroneously . The other persons mentioned in [ the applicant \u2019s ] representations have contested having had knowledge of the data mentioned therein concerning [ the applicant ] and her family .", "According to the director in charge of [ the hospital \u2019s ] archives it is not possible to retroactively clarify the use of patient records . The data system reveals CARDINAL most recent consultations ( by working unit and not by person ) but this information is deleted once the file has been returned to the archives .", "Therefore , ORG can not further rule on whether information contained in the patient records has been used by or given to an outsider .", "Having regard to the foregoing , ORG however finds that the system should record any consultation of patient files as a safeguard of privacy in order to ensure that the responsibility for a possible leak of information can be individualised . For the future , ORG draws the hospital \u2019s attention to the protection obligation and the duty to take care provided by LAW , and further , to the need to ensure that privacy protection is not put at risk when processing medical data within the hospital . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
