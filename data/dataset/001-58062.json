ORG Since DATE , serious disturbances have raged in the South - East of GPE between the security forces and the members of the ORG ( ORG of Kurdistan ) . This confrontation has so far , according to the ORG , claimed the lives of CARDINAL civilians and CARDINAL members of the security forces . It appears from information submitted by the applicants and by the amicus curiae that a large number of villages , estimated at CARDINAL , have been destroyed and evacuated during this conflict ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Since DATE , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL provinces of south - eastern GPE have been subjected to emergency rule which was in force at the time of the facts complained of .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicants ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , NORP nationals , were residents in the village of GPE in the NORP district of the province of GPE . The village of GPE and the surrounding areas have been the centre of intense NORP terrorist activity . It is undisputed that the ORG launched serious attacks on ORG on DATE or DATE , and the neighbouring village of GPE on DATE . As a result of the first attack , CARDINAL Kelek\u00e7i villagers were killed and CARDINAL others wounded . The second attack on DATE was directed at the GPE gendarme station , which was destroyed , with CARDINAL gendarme being killed and CARDINAL others injured . Thereafter security forces were reinforced in the area and extensive searches were carried out for terrorists . The applicants alleged that on DATE ORG security forces launched an attack on the village of GPE , burnt QUANTITY houses , including their homes , and forced the immediate evacuation of the entire village .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Government categorically denied these allegations , contending that the houses had been set on fire by the ORG . Initially they stated that the village had merely been searched and that no damage had been caused . Subsequently , it was maintained that no soldiers had entered GPE on DATE , and , if they had been in the vicinity , they had stopped on the outskirts of the village to take a rest .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE houses in GPE were set on fire and the village was almost completely destroyed . It is disputed , however , whether this destruction was caused by terrorists or by security forces .", "CARDINAL . The Commission established that QUANTITY houses , including those of the applicants , were destroyed or seriously damaged by fire not long after the attack on the GPE gendarme station on DATE . Although noting that there was some uncertainty as to the exact date when the QUANTITY houses were burnt , it accepted the applicants ' claims that this occurred on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that no proper investigation was carried out at the domestic level regarding the destruction of the QUANTITY houses at GPE on DATE either immediately after the event or thereafter . Apparently , a gendarmerie report of CARDINAL DATE dealt with events at GPE . However , the Commission concluded that this report and other \" incident reports \" which had been submitted to ORG at ORG , in so far as they concerned the destruction of the QUANTITY houses , did not result in any investigation of the facts and involved no attempt to establish responsibility for the destruction .", "CARDINAL . ORG It was also established by the Commission that , although the applicants had lost their homes , no one gave proper advice to them or , apparently , to the other displaced ORG villagers , on how to obtain compensation for the loss of their homes or other forms of assistance . Petitions were made by the mayor of the village and statements were given to several ORG officials . However , no authority took up the applicants ' problems or referred them to the competent body .", "CARDINAL . ORG There was also evidence before the Commission that , after the case had been brought to it , certain of the applicants , or persons who were believed to be applicants such as ORG and PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , had been questioned by the ORG authorities about their applications to the ORG . ORG had been provided with a filmed interview with these QUANTITY persons , during which they were asked about the case in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG As regards the events on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Commission noted that the investigation reports and the recorded statements by villagers which had been submitted to it by the respondent Government were dated DATE , i.e. DATE after the destruction of the QUANTITY houses . In these statements they placed the blame on the ORG for setting fire to the houses . At that time , a number of villagers had been heard by the authorities about events at GPE . It was observed that this inquiry had taken place at a time when the village had been further damaged on DATE , and after the ORG had communicated the applicants ' complaints to the Government for observations and decided to hold an oral hearing in the case .", "It was further noted that the investigation reports of DATE were based on an exploratory mission undertaken by helicopter on DATE . During this mission , the investigating team did not land at GPE but only observed the village during low - level flights . The report stated that all the houses at ORG had collapsed and that there were no inhabitants in the village .", "CARDINAL . ORG As to the events of DATE , the ORG found that a team of gendarmes had heard various villagers in DATE . However , in their recorded statements no reference was made by the villagers to the incident of CARDINAL DATE . The statements were examined by ORG in order to determine whether they should affect the ORG 's findings on questions of fact in respect of the incident complained of . In its report of CARDINAL DATE it concluded as follows :", "\" CARDINAL . In this respect , it is striking that the various statements by the villagers are drafted in a stereotyped form and have on the whole the same contents ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE ) . Most of them describe the events of DATE in an almost identical manner . In the recorded statements the villagers refer to the fact that the terrorists had made a previous attack on the village during which CARDINAL persons had been killed and CARDINAL others injured , this general formula being used even in the statements of the applicants PERSON and PERSON whose close relatives , including the latter 's father , had been killed on that occasion . The statements also contain a declaration about the villagers ' respect for the ORG and their willingness to help the ORG . All in all , the recorded statements give the impression of having been drafted in a uniform manner by the gendarmes rather than reflecting spontaneous declarations by the villagers . This may also explain why some of these statements are in complete contradiction to what the same persons have stated on other occasions ( see PERSON statements referred to in DATE and CARDINAL above , PERSON statements referred to in DATE and DATE above , and PERSON statements referred to in CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . Thus it seems highly doubtful whether the recorded statements to the gendarmes can be said to reflect the information that the villagers intended to convey in regard to the events at issue . \"", "CARDINAL . The Commission concluded that it attached no particular weight to the statements of the villagers in DATE . It further noted the inadequacy of any real investigations at the domestic level which could be of assistance in elucidating the events on DATE . It concluded that the absence of any such investigations was in itself a disturbing element in regard to a serious matter such as the destruction of the homes of a considerable number of persons .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the absence of any relevant investigations at the domestic level , the Commission based its finding on the evidence which had been given orally by various persons or submitted in writing in the course of the proceedings before it .", "CARDINAL . The Commission concluded that there was no evidence of any conspiracy between the villagers to accuse the ORG of the burning of the houses in order to obtain compensation or for any other purpose .", "It also noted that , while there was evidence that the security forces were in the village , none of the witnesses stated that any stranger had been seen at ORG on DATE . It was unlikely that terrorists would have set fire to QUANTITY houses in the village without anyone having noted their presence . Nor was there any other evidence showing that terrorists had been at GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Following an assessment of the evidence , the Commission found it convincingly shown that security forces - presumably under the strain of intense terrorist activity in the area - were responsible for the burning of the CARDINAL Kelek\u00e7i houses on DATE . However , it had not been shown that the applicants were forcibly expelled from ORG , but the loss of their homes caused them to abandon the village and move elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Government have submitted that the following domestic law is relevant to the case .", "LAW provides as follows :", "\" All acts or decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review ...", "The administration shall be liable to indemnify any damage caused by its own acts and measures . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The above provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war . The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration , whose responsibility is of an absolute , objective nature , based on a concept of collective liability and referred to as the theory of \" social risk \" . Thus the administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the ORG may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety , or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property .", "CARDINAL . ORG The principle of administrative liability is reflected in the additional LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE on ORG , which provides :", "\" ... actions for compensation in relation to the exercise of the powers conferred by this PERSON are to be brought against the administration before the administrative courts . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG LAW makes it a criminal offence", "- to deprive someone unlawfully of his or her liberty ( LAW generally , LAW ,", "- to oblige someone through force or threats to commit or not to commit an act ( Article CARDINAL ) , - to issue threats ( Article CARDINAL ) ,", "- to make an unlawful search of someone 's home ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) ,", "- to commit arson ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) , or aggravated arson if human life is endangered ( Article CARDINAL ) ,", "- to commit arson unintentionally by carelessness , negligence or inexperience ( Article CARDINAL ) , or", "- to damage another 's property intentionally ( Articles CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG For all these offences complaints may be lodged , pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities . The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them , the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated , pursuant to LAW . A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG If the suspected authors of the contested acts are military personnel , they may also be prosecuted for causing extensive damage , endangering human lives or damaging property , if they have not followed orders in conformity with Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the Military Code . Proceedings in these circumstances may be initiated by the persons concerned ( non - military ) before the competent authority under LAW , or before the suspected persons ' hierarchical superior ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL on the LAW and the Procedure of Military Courts ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG If the alleged author of a crime is an agent of the ORG , permission to prosecute must be obtained from local administrative councils ( ORG of ORG ) . The local council decisions may be appealed to ORG ( PERSON ) ; a refusal to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal of this kind .", "CARDINAL . ORG Any illegal act by civil servants , be it a crime or a tort , which causes material or moral damage may be the subject of a claim for compensation before the ordinary civil courts .", "CARDINAL . ORG Proceedings against the administration may be brought before the administrative courts , whose proceedings are in writing .", "CARDINAL . Damage caused by terrorist violence may be compensated out of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the LAW provide for fundamental limitations on constitutional safeguards .", "CARDINAL . ORG Provisional LAW provides that there can be no allegation of unconstitutionality in respect of measures taken under laws or decrees having the force of law and enacted between CARDINAL DATE and DATE . That includes PERSON no . CARDINAL on ORG of CARDINAL DATE , under which decrees have been issued which are immune from judicial challenge .", "CARDINAL . ORG Extensive powers have been granted to ORG of ORG by such decrees , especially Decree no . CARDINAL , as amended by Decrees nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and Decree no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG Decree no . CARDINAL modifies the application of PERSON no . ORG , the Anti - Terror Law ( DATE ) , in those areas which are subject to the state of emergency , with the effect that the decision to prosecute members of the security forces is removed from the public prosecutor and conferred on local administrative councils . According to ORG , these councils are made up of civil servants and have been criticised for their lack of legal knowledge , as well as for being easily influenced by the Regional Governor or ORG , who also head the security forces .", "CARDINAL . ORG LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE provides as follows :", "\" No criminal , financial or legal responsibility may be claimed against ORG or a NORP Governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers entrusted to them by this decree , and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to this end . This is without prejudice to the rights of individuals to claim indemnity from the ORG for damage suffered by them without justification . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG According to the submissions of the applicants , this Article grants impunity to the Governors and reinforces the powers of the Regional Governor to order the permanent or temporary evacuation of villages , to impose residence restrictions and to enforce the transfer of people to other areas . Damage caused in the context of the fight against terrorism would be \" with justification \" and therefore immune from suit ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["25", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["25-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "18"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
