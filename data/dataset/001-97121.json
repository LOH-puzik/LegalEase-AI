NORP The applicant company is based in ORG . Its business is publishing and marketing magazines , including the DATE Autoweek , which caters for readers who are interested in motoring .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and shown by documents available to the public , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an illegal street race was held in an industrial area on the outskirts of the town of GPE . Journalists of PERSON attended this race at the invitation of its organisers . The journalists were given the opportunity to take photographs of the street race and of the participating cars and persons . Before they were given permission to take photographs , the journalists were made to guarantee the participants that the latter \u2019s identity would remain undisclosed . The street race was ended by the police , who were present and eventually intervened . The police did not make any arrests .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company intended to publish an article about illegal car races in LOC no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE . This article would be accompanied by photographs of the car race held on DATE . These photographs would be edited in such a manner that the participating cars and persons were unidentifiable , thus guaranteeing the anonymity of the participants in the race . The original photographs were stored by the applicant company on a CD - ROM , which was kept in the editorial office of a different magazine published by the applicant company ( not NORP ) .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE , a police officer contacted the PERSON editorial office by telephone , summoning the editors to surrender to the police all photographic materials concerning the street race of DATE . This police officer was informed by the staff member whom she had called , i.e. the features chief editor ( chef reportage ) , that this request could not be met as the journalists had only been given permission to take photographs of the street race after having guaranteed the anonymity of the participants in the race . He further told this police officer that he thought that the press was reasonably protected against this kind of [ police ] action and advised her to contact the editorial office in writing .", "CARDINAL . In TIME DATE , QUANTITY police detectives visited the NORP editorial office and , after having unsuccessfully tried to obtain the surrender of the photographs , issued PERSON \u2019s editor - in - chief with a summons , within the meaning of Article PERSON of LAW Wetboek van Strafvordering ) . This summons was issued by the GPE public prosecutor and ordered the applicant company to surrender , in the context of a criminal investigation into offences defined in ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) against an unspecified person , the photographs taken on DATE during the illegal street race in GPE and all related materials . On behalf of the applicant company , ORG \u2019s editor - in - chief PERSON refused to surrender the photographs , considering this to be contrary to the undertaking given by the journalists to the street race participants as regards their anonymity .", "CARDINAL . DATE , a telephone conversation took place between , on the one side , CARDINAL public prosecutors and , on the other , the lawyer of the applicant company . The lawyer was told by the public prosecutors that \u201c it concerned a matter of life and death \u201d . No further explanation was given and the lawyer \u2019s request to amend the summons was not entertained .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police detectives and the public prosecutors threatened to detain Mr B. during DATE of CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE for having acted in violation of LAW , i.e. the offence of failure to comply with an official order ( ambtelijk bevel ) , and to close and search the applicant company \u2019s LOC , if need be , for DATE . The latter action would entail considerable financial damage for the applicant company as , during DATE , articles were to be prepared for publication on the subject of the wedding of the GPE PERSON , due to take place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , PERSON was arrested on suspicion of having violated LAW . He was not taken to the police station but remained on the applicant company \u2019s LOC . After the GPE public prosecutor had arrived on these LOC and after PERSON had been brought before the prosecutor , PERSON was released at TIME", "CARDINAL . The applicant company then consulted its own lawyer and a second lawyer . The latter spoke with the public prosecutors involved , after which the duty investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) was contacted by telephone . After having spoken with one of the lawyers assisting the applicant company , and after having been briefed by CARDINAL of the public prosecutors , the investigating judge expressed the view that the needs of the criminal investigation outweighed the applicant company \u2019s journalistic privilege . On DATE at TIME , the applicant company , through its lawyer and under protest , surrendered the CD - ROM containing the photographs to the public prosecutor , who formally seized it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company filed a complaint under LAW PERSON of LAW , seeking the lifting of the seizure and restitution of the CDROM , an order to the police and prosecution department to destroy copies of the data recorded on the CD - ROM and an injunction preventing the police and prosecution department from taking cognisance or making use of information obtained through the CD - ROM .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing was held before ORG during which the public prosecutor explained why the surrender of the photographs had been necessary . The summons complained of had been issued in the context of a criminal investigation concerning serious criminals who had pulled cash dispensers out of the wall with the aid of a shovel loader , and there was reason to believe that a car used by participants in the street race could lead to the perpetrator(s ) of those robberies .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE ORG granted the request to lift the seizure and to return the CD - ROM to the applicant company as the interests of the investigation did not oppose this . It rejected the remainder of the applicant company \u2019s complaint . It found the seizure lawful and , on this point , considered that a publisher / journalist could not , as such , be regarded as enjoying the privilege of non - disclosure ( verschoningsrecht ) under Article CARDINALa of LAW . Statutorily , the persons referred to in LAW and acknowledged as enjoying the privilege of non - disclosure were , amongst others , public notaries , lawyers and doctors . It considered that the right to freedom of expression , as guaranteed by LAW , included the right freely to gather news ( recht van vrije nieuwsgaring ) which , consequently , deserved protection unless outweighed by another interest warranting priority . It found that , in the instant case , the criminal investigation interest outweighed the right to free gathering of news in that , as explained by the public prosecutor during the hearing , the investigation at issue did not concern the illegal street race , in which context the undertaking of protection of sources had been given , but an investigation into other serious offences . ORG was therefore of the opinion that the case at hand concerned a situation in which the protection of journalistic sources should yield to general investigation interests , the more so as the undertaking to the journalistic source concerned the street race whereas the investigation did not concern that race . It found established that the data stored on the CD - ROM had been used for the investigation of serious offences and that it had been made clear by the prosecutor that these data were relevant to the investigation at issue as all other investigation avenues had led to nothing . It therefore concluded that the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity had been complied with and that the interference had thus been justified . ORG did not find that the seizure had been rash , although more tactful action on the part of the police and the public prosecutor might have prevented the apparent escalation of the matter .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company \u2019s subsequent appeal in cassation was declared inadmissible by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . ORG held that , as ORG had accepted the applicant company \u2019s complaint in so far as it related to the request to lift the seizure and to return the CD - ROM , the applicant company no longer had an interest in its appeal against the ruling of DATE . Referring to its case - law ( ORG , DATE , PERSON ( GPE Law Reports \u2013 \u201c GPE \u201d ) DATE , no . CARDINAL , and ORG , CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , it held that this finding was not altered by the circumstance that the complaint \u2013 apart from a request to return the CD - ROM \u2013 also contained a request to order that any print - outs or copies of the CD - ROM were to be destroyed and that data collected with the aid of the CD - ROM could not be used , as neither Article DATE nor any other provision of LAW provided for the possibility of obtaining , once a seized item had been returned , in a procedure like the present one , a declaratory ruling that the seizure or the use of the seized item was unlawful .", "CARDINAL . In their observations on the admissibility and merits of the application , the ORG stated the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL . To supplement the summary of the facts appended to the ORG \u2019s letter of DATE [ giving notice of the application to the respondent ORG under LAW ( b ) of ORG ] , the Government would make the following observations", "CARDINAL . The order in question , issued LAW PERSON of LAW ( ... , \u2018 CCP\u2019 ) , requiring the surrender for seizure of a CD - ROM containing photographs was closely related to a criminal investigation initiated following a series of ram raids in which cash machines were pulled from the wall with a shovel loader . These ram raids took place on DATE , DATE and DATE . A group of men was suspected of perpetrating the ram raids and CARDINAL members of the group ( \u2018 A\u2019 and \u2018 M\u2019 ) were the main suspects . A telephone conversation involving M , tapped in the context of the investigation on DATE , revealed that M and A had participated in an illegal street race in GPE with an ORG RSCARDINAL that day . The investigation team knew that journalists from the DATE magazine PERSON had taken photographs of the illegal street race .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another ram raid took place . During the incident , a bystander was threatened with a firearm . After ramming a cash machine , the perpetrators hauled it off in a lorry , which was followed closely by an ORG . The police , who had already been informed of the incident , saw the lorry stop and the driver get into an ORG , which then drove away with CARDINAL people inside . The police followed , but the ORG accelerated to QUANTITY and disappeared from view .", "CARDINAL . The police suspected that the ORG used in the illegal street race in GPE on DATE was the same ORG observed at the ram raid on DATE . With that in mind , the public prosecutor decided DATE ( DATE ) to issue an order under LAW ORG in order to obtain the photographs taken at the street race .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINALa of LAW entered into force on DATE . Prior to this date , only the investigating judge was competent to issue an order to surrender items for the purpose of seizure ( former LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A failure to comply with such an order constitutes an offence as defined in LAW failure to comply with an official order ) or LAW failure to make available documents ) of LAW . Pursuant to LAW \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY of LAW , no such order may be given to the suspect or to a person who , by virtue of ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , enjoys the privilege of nondisclosure . Such persons are an accused \u2019s relatives , ( former ) spouse and ( former ) registered partner ( Article CARDINAL ) ; persons who , by virtue of their position , profession or office , are bound to secrecy albeit that their privilege of non - disclosure only covers matters the knowledge of which has been entrusted to them in that capacity ( Article CARDINAL ; for further details about this category , see PERSON v. the GPE , no .

Such an objection is heard in public by ORG , which has the power to give whatever orders the situation may require ( Article PERSON of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , ORG did not recognise a journalistic privilege of non - disclosure . On DATE , it handed down a judgment in which it found that a journalist , when asked as a witness to disclose his source , was obliged to do so unless it could be regarded as justified in the parti that the interest of non - disclosure of a source outweighed the interest served by such disclosure . This principle was reversed by ORG in a landmark judgment of DATE on the basis of the principles set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON v. GPE . In this ruling , ORG accepted that , pursuant to LAW , a journalist was in principle entitled to non - disclosure of an information source unless , on the basis of arguments to be presented by the party seeking disclosure of a source , the judge was satisfied that such disclosure was necessary in a democratic society for CARDINAL or more of the legitimate aims set out in LAW , no . CARDINAL ) . In a judgment given on DATE concerning the search of premises of a publishing company on DATE ( ORG [ National Jurisprudence Number ] PERSON ) , ORG held inter alia :", "\u201c The right of freedom of expression , as set out in LAW , encompasses also the right freely to gather news ( see , amongst others , PERSON v. the GPE , judgment of DATE , GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ; and Roemen and PERSON v. GPE , judgment of DATE [ ORG CARDINALIV ] ) . An interference with the right freely to gather news \u2013 including the interest of protection of a journalistic source \u2013 can be justified under LAW in so far as the conditions set out in that provision have been complied with . That means in the first place that the interference must have a basis in national law and that those national legal rules must have a certain precision . Secondly , the interference must serve CARDINAL of the aims mentioned in LAW . Thirdly , the interference must be necessary in a NORP society for attaining such an aim . In this , the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality play a role . In that framework it must be weighed whether the interference is necessary to serve the interest involved and therefore whether no other , less far - reaching ways ( minder bezwarende wegen ) can be followed along which this interest can be served to a sufficient degree . Where it concerns a criminal investigation , it must be considered whether the interference with the right freely to gather news is proportionate to the interest served in arriving at the truth . In that last consideration , the gravity of the offences under investigation will play a role . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

R(CARDINAL ) CARDINAL adopted on DATE by ORG DATE ( see below under \u201c Relevant international materials \u201d ) , ORG ( College van procureurs - generaal ) adopted an ORG within the meaning of LAW of ORG ( Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie ) on the application by ORG of coercive measures in respect of journalists ( Aanwijzing toepassing dwangmiddelen bij journalisten ; published in ORG , no .

This Instruction defines who is to be considered as a \u201c journalist \u201d and sets out the pertinent principles and guidelines as regards the application of coercive measures , such as inter alia an order under LAW , in respect of a journalist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the boards of ORG - in - Chief ( PERSON ) and GPE ( PERSON ) set up a commission to investigate and take stock of problems arising in relation to the protection of journalistic sources and seizure of journalistic materials . This commission \u2013 which was composed of a professor of criminal law , the secretary of GPE , a ORG judge and an editor of a national DATE newspaper DATE concluded in its report of DATE , inter alia , that specific legislation was not necessary and that by way of making certain procedural changes \u2013 such as a preliminary assessment procedure , where it concerned the application of coercive measures in cases where the protection of sources was in issue \u2013 a number of problem areas could be resolved .", "CARDINAL .
