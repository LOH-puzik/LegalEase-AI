The soldiers deposited a large number of arms and ammunition collected from the fighters near the hospital . They then went to PERSON central square to see a convoy of CARDINAL buses containing fighters , some of them wounded .

Journalists and cameramen from ORG , ORG and the army \u2019s press service stated that ORG had told the reporters that he had been in charge of a small group of fighters . During the encounter with General PERSON he had behaved in a slowed - down manner , as if under the influence of narcotics .

The witness stated that he had concluded from the fighter \u2019s inadequate reaction that ORG had been intoxicated , but as there was no smell of alcohol , he thought he might be under the influence of narcotics . The officer said that his harsh reaction had been caused by the detainee \u2019s dangerous conduct , which could have incited other fighters and the villagers to disobey . In his first witness statement Mr PERSON claimed that the video footage had been altered to omit the fighter \u2019s provocative statements . He stressed that the servicemen surrounding him were not his subordinates and thus could not have taken orders from him .
