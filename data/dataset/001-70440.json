PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant entered the GPE , where he applied for asylum . He stated that , during the former ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) regime of PERSON in GPE , he had been a member of ORG ( ORG ) and had been a pilot in the NORP air force . He further stated that , DATE , he had stayed in GPE for military training purposes . After having returned to GPE in DATE , he had participated between DATE and DATE in military operations in GPE , Tigra and PERSON and had carried out bombings . DATE and DATE , he had stayed for a second period in GPE for further military training . When the PERSON regime had been overthrown in DATE , he had remained in GPE and had returned to GPE in DATE . Shortly after his return , he had reported to the new authorities in GPE and had subsequently been sent to a political re - education camp . He had stayed in that camp from DATE until CARDINAL or DATE , when he had been released with an obligation to report regularly to the authorities . He had complied with this obligation until DATE when DATE after having heard that pilots had been arrested on accusations of murder and plundering , and after members of the military had come to his aunt \u2019s house with whom he had then lived and who had asked for him DATE he had gone into hiding for fear of being arrested again . He had left GPE for GPE in DATE . In the course of DATE , he had travelled from GPE to GPE where , holding forged residence permits , he had stayed until DATE when he had travelled on his own NORP passport via GPE to the GPE .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s asylum request was rejected by the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) , who did not find it established that the applicant had a well - founded fear of persecution .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision with the Deputy Minister . On DATE he filed a request with the President of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE for an interim measure to the effect that he would be allowed to remain in the GPE pending the proceedings on his objection .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on CARDINAL DATE , the Acting President of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for an interim measure . The Acting President considered , inter alia , that there were no concrete indications that the applicant would be arrested if he returned to GPE , that the applicant \u2019s claims were only based on assumptions and hearsay information , and that the fact that his passport had been prolonged on DATE by the NORP consular authorities in GPE indicated that the applicant was not sought by the NORP authorities . The Acting President concluded that it had not been established that the applicant had a well - founded fear of persecution or that his expulsion to GPE would be contrary to the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . Further considering that the proceedings on the applicant \u2019s objection would not result in a different finding , the Acting President also rejected the applicant \u2019s objection , in accordance with LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) as in force at the material time .", "No further appeal lay against this decision .", "On DATE , the applicant requested ORG of The GPE for a revision ( herziening ) of the ruling of DATE . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected the revision request .", "On DATE the applicant filed a second asylum request on the basis of new facts and circumstances , namely a copy of a letter of DATE addressed to his aunt by the NORP authorities , requesting information about the applicant \u2019s new address . The applicant further submitted that , in the proceedings on his first asylum request , he had omitted to say that , in his function as an air force pilot , he had participated in CARDINAL of flights over war zones .", "The Deputy Minister of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s second asylum request on DATE , holding that it did not appear from the letter of DATE from which it could only be concluded that the authorities wished to be informed of the applicant \u2019s new address DATE that the applicant had a well - founded fear of persecution . The Deputy Minister further held that this finding was supported by the applicant \u2019s statements that he had remained in contact with an aunt and his brother in GPE , and that there was no evidence whatsoever of any interest being shown by the NORP authorities in the applicant since DATE . The Deputy Minister further held that the applicant \u2019s statement about his participation in numerous flights over war zones did not constitute a relevant legal novum , as this element had already been taken into account in the proceedings on his first asylum request .", "The applicant filed an objection against this decision with the Deputy Minister and requested the President of ORG of The GPE to issue an injunction to stay his expulsion pending the proceedings on his objection .", "On DATE , the Acting President of ORG of The GPE accepted the applicant \u2019s request for an injunction . On the basis of , inter alia , information obtained by the applicant from ORG and ORG , the Acting President considered that it was plausible that pilots of the former NORP air force , like the applicant , who had been involved in bombings of the then freedom fighters , did in fact risk serious repercussions from the current NORP authorities , and that a further investigation was required to assess whether the applicant had a well - founded fear of persecution in GPE . The Acting President , having noted the applicant \u2019s statement that the rank last held by him was that of CARDINALst lieutenant - pilot , considered that , to this end , it was necessary to obtain an individual official report ( individueel ambtsbericht ) on the applicant \u2019s personal situation from the Minister of ORG and , after receipt of this official report , to hear the applicant before ORG for ORG ( PERSON vreemdelingenzaken ) .", "On DATE , ORG transmitted the requested individual official report to the Deputy Minister of ORG , who sent a copy to the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE . It reads , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL.a . The statement of DATE by ORG submitted by the [ applicant ] has been issued by this organisation and the therein - cited ranks of the air force officers are correctly mentioned .", "CARDINAL.b . According to ORG and ORG , CARDINAL air force officers from the former ORG - period are detained in the ORG prison , which serves as a prison for authorities of the former ORG regime , on suspicion of genocide and crimes against humanity . There is no re - education regime in this prison . Some of these air force officers were arrested and detained in DATE after DATE of the ORG rule DATE , others later in DATE , [ and ] initially without any official charges having been brought . The[ir ] detention was ordered by ORG , who deals with trial proceedings against members of the ORG regime who are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity .", "A general unofficial accusation against the air force during the ORG - regime is that it has caused many civilian casualties during bombings and firing from the air in the fight against the NORP Peoples\u2019 ORG ( EPRDF ) , ORG ( ORG ) and ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The same rights and obligations as for any other NORP [ citizen ] apply to former detainees of a re - education camp after their return to NORP society .", "CARDINAL . The ... address in PERSON cited by the [ applicant ] exists . A sister of the [ applicant ] and her children live there . According to the persons living at this address and neighbours , the [ applicant ] had been held in DATE in a re - education camp and , towards DATE , had left PERSON for reasons unknown . The [ persons heard ] did not know when the [ applicant ] had been released from the above - mentioned re - education camp . According to the same persons , the [ applicant ] was a lieutenant in the NORP air force , but he would not have studied in GPE . Also according to information by these persons , local militia would have searched for the [ applicant ] after his departure , because his appointment as lieutenant in the NORP air force would at the time have been a political appointment .", "CARDINAL . In so far as could be verified , the [ applicant ] has been detained in the re - education camp ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the archive of this office , the copy of a letter of DATE of ORG , submitted by the [ applicant ] , is not a copy of an authentic document .", "CARDINAL . It has not been possible to verify the authenticity of the identity card ... , submitted by the [ applicant ] . \u201d", "On DATE , the applicant was heard before ORG for ORG .", "On DATE , ORG informed the Deputy Minister of ORG that a further investigation had been carried out in GPE , and that the applicant \u2019s name was mentioned in the list of suspects of the PERSON - tribunal in GPE .", "On the basis of the information contained in the individual official report , the Deputy Minister decided to investigate whether the applicant \u2019s situation fell within the scope of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which provides as follows :", "\u201c The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that :", "( a ) he has committed a crime against peace , a war crime , or a crime against humanity , as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes ;", "( b ) he has committed a serious non - political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee ;", "( c ) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of ORG . \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s lawyer , who learned about this development on DATE , informed the Minister of ORG on DATE that he found this approach unacceptable .", "On DATE , an immigration official conducted a further interview with the applicant about his membership of the ORG , his duties as an air force pilot , his career in the air force and whether he had been involved in the bombing of civilian targets .", "On DATE , the Deputy Minister of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objection against the decision of DATE . The Deputy Minister found that the applicant \u2019s acts as an air force pilot during the PERSON regime fell within the scope of LAW of LAW , that he could be held responsible for these acts , that consequently LAW applied to his situation and that the applicant was therefore ineligible for asylum . Pursuant to LAW , he was also ineligible for a residence permit on any other grounds , including a residence permit for a limited duration based on LAW .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG of The Hague and , on DATE , requested the provisional measures judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of that same court to issue an injunction to stay his expulsion pending the proceedings on his appeal .", "On DATE , the applicant filed his written grounds of appeal with ORG of The Hague , in which he argued that LAW of LAW had been unjustly applied to his case , and that the decision of DATE had been taken in violation of the general principles of proper administration ( algemene beginselen van behoorlijk bestuur ) . In his appeal submissions to ORG , the applicant mentioned LAW without any further elaboration .", "In its decision of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG of The Hague rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It considered that , pursuant to LAW ( PERSON ) , a person filing a repeat asylum request \u2013 i.e. after a negative decision had been taken on an original asylum request \u2013 should adduce newly emerged facts or altered circumstances ( nieuw gebleken feiten of veranderde omstandigheden ) that were not known when the initial negative decision was taken and of such a nature that it could lead to a different decision . It further noted that , under LAW , such a repeat request could be rejected with reference to the initial negative decision if no such new facts or circumstances had been adduced . Referring to the case - law of ORG of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State ) , ORG considered that it was for the courts to assess whether there was a novum within the meaning of Article CARDINAL and that this included facts or circumstances that had occurred after the negative decision on the original request had been taken or facts or circumstances that could not have been adduced earlier , as well as evidence in support of already submitted facts or circumstances which evidence could not have been submitted prior to the negative decision on the original request . However , even in case these requirements were met , such new facts and circumstances could nevertheless be regarded as not amounting to a novum if it was clear beforehand that they would not affect the decision taken on an original request or the reasons on which this decision was based .", "In the instant case , ORG held inter alia that the differences in the respective statements given by the applicant in the CARDINAL subsequent asylum proceedings about the scope of his involvement in war events did raise questions , but could not be regarded as a novum because it concerned information which the applicant already held when he had filed his first asylum request and his participation in flights over war zones had in fact already been addressed in the decision of DATE on his first asylum request . It therefore concluded that the applicant \u2019s second asylum was not based on new facts or changed circumstances within the meaning of LAW ( PERSON ) . In accordance with LAW , this decision was notified to the applicant on DATE . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "On DATE , the provisional measures judge declared inadmissible the applicant \u2019s request of CARDINAL DATE for an injunction staying his expulsion , as his appeal on the merits had been rejected by ORG of The Hague in the meantime . This decision was also notified to the applicant on DATE .", "Until DATE , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by LAW DATE ( PERSON ; \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) . Further rules were set out in LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingenbesluit ) , the Regulation on Aliens ( Voorschrift Vreemdelingen ) and LAW DATE ( PERSON ) . LAW ( PERSON ) applied to proceedings under LAW , unless indicates otherwise in this LAW .", "On DATE , the DATE LAW and the pertaining regulations were replaced by LAW , LAW , the Regulation on Aliens DATE and LAW DATE . Unless indicated otherwise in LAW , LAW continued to apply to proceedings on requests by aliens for admission and residence .", "The applicant \u2019s first asylum request was examined under LAW . Although his second asylum request had been introduced under LAW , the applicant \u2019s objection against the decision of DATE was determined on the basis of LAW .", "Under LAW of the DATE LAW DATE , aliens coming from a country where they have a well - founded reason to fear persecution on account of their religious or political convictions , or of belonging to a particular race or a particular social group , could be admitted as refugees . The expression \u201c refugee \u201d in this provision was construed to have the same meaning as in LAW , as amended by LAW of DATE ( decision of ORG of DATE , PERSON [ ORG ] DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "Under LAW of LAW , an alien may be eligible for a residence permit for the purposes of asylum if inter alia :", "he or she is a refugee within the meaning of LAW , or", "he or she has established well - founded reasons to assume that he / she will run a real risk of being subjected to torture or other cruel or degrading treatment or punishment if expelled to the country of origin .", "However , if the exclusion clause under LAW of the DATE Convention applies , the alien concerned loses any protection which would have been available under LAW and , consequently , becomes ineligible for a residence permit for asylum under LAW of LAW . In such a situation and pursuant to LAW , the alien concerned can neither be granted a residence permit on any of the other grounds referred to in LAW .", "However , a refusal to grant a residence permit on the basis of LAW of LAW does not necessarily imply that the alien concerned will be effectively removed to his or her country of origin if that would be in breach of LAW . In CARDINAL rulings handed down on , respectively , CARDINAL and DATE CARDINAL examination of these cases had been incomplete .", "These rulings resulted in an amendment to the relevant rules . Where it has been established that a person , for reasons based on LAW , can not be expelled to his or her country of origin but , pursuant to LAW , is ineligible for a residence permit , no expulsion order will be issued , at least for as long as these reasons exist . However , no residence title will be issued to the alien concerned who remains under the obligation to leave the GPE at his or her own motion . It further remains possible to issue an order for his or her expulsion as soon as his or her removal will no longer entail a risk of treatment contrary to LAW in the country of origin or an order for removal to a third ORG willing to accept the person concerned ( Chapter CCARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL of LAW CARDINAL , as amended on DATE ) .", "Article CARDINAL of LAW provides that a petitioner must adduce newly emerged facts or altered circumstances if a new request is filed following a decision in which the original request is , either totally or partially , rejected . When no such facts or altered circumstances have been adduced , the administrative authority may reject the new request with reference to the decision on the original request . Article CARDINAL thus embodies the ne bis in idem principle for the administrative law .", "Nevertheless , an exception has been made in this particular area of the law , in that an alien may adduce exceptional facts and circumstances relating to him or her personally , on the basis of which the new request may be assessed outside the framework of Article CARDINAL . In the case of a repeat asylum application which also invokes the risk of treatment contrary to LAW , an assessment by the court outside the framework of Article CARDINAL is therefore possible . ORG of ORG has on CARDINAL occasion quashed the dismissal of a repeat application for a residence permit for the purposes of asylum despite the absence of new facts or altered circumstances ( judgment of DATE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON Asiel- en ORG [ Newsletter on Asylum and Refugee law ] CARDINAL ) . It did so on the basis of the exceptional circumstance that there was no dispute between the parties , that on his return to his country of origin , the alien would run a real risk of being subjected to treatment or punishment proscribed by LAW .", "According to LAW , any act of a public body in respect of an alien is to be equated with a formal decision within the meaning of LAW , entailing that such an act may be challenged in administrative appeal proceedings . If the act concerns an act aimed at the expulsion of an alien who has been denied admission , the lawfulness of this act will already have been judicially determined in the ruling dismissing the appeal brought against a negative decision on an admission request . However , this is not the case when the situation at the time of expulsion differs from the situation at the time of the judgment rejecting the appeal in such a way that it can no longer be said that the lawfulness of the expulsion has been established ( Parliamentary Papers , ORG ( ORG ) of ORG , DATE , CARDINAL , no.CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "Policy is based on official country reports ( ambtsberichten ) , periodically drawn up by ORG . At the material time , the GPE policy was based on the official country report on GPE issued in DATE . According to this report , the observance of civil and political rights in GPE had , in comparison with DATE , generally improved . However , despite statutory guarantees , there were in practice breaches of certain fundamental rights , including freedom of expression and freedom of assembly . The victims were journalists , union members and others who were highly critical of the Government , as well as members of the banned opposition parties . The situation was , however , not such that every asylum seeker from GPE automatically qualified for asylum . Any asylum seeker from GPE should demonstrate that his or her personal circumstances \u2013 viewed objectively \u2013 justified his or her fear of persecution as defined in refugee law or constituted grounds for granting a residence permit on grounds of compelling humanitarian reasons , e.g. because he or she would be subjected to treatment in violation of LAW if he or she were to return .", "The most recent official country report on GPE was issued by ORG on DATE .
