The assertion that he was entitled to rely on the medical records alone shows that , though an able scientist , this young doctor was nonetheless unaware of one of the essential skills of the practice of medicine : listening to , getting to know and examining the patient . Indeed , before this Court Dr [ PERSON ] said that the accident had impressed upon him how vital it was to take precautions before operating .", "There is a clear causal link between this negligent act and omission and the death of the child PERSON was carrying . The accused has himself acknowledged , with commendable honesty , that a clinical examination would have alerted him to the fact that the patient was pregnant and had been mistaken for another patient .", "As regards the classification of the offence as unintentional homicide , it is first necessary to reiterate the legal principles governing this sphere .", "Various provisions of international treaties , such as LAW signed in GPE on DATE , recognise a right to life protected by law for everyone , and notably children .", "Under domestic law , section CARDINAL of the Voluntary Termination of Pregnancy LAW no .

That reservation shows , by converse implication , that that convention could concern a foetus aged DATE , the statutory maximum foetal age in GPE for a voluntary termination of pregnancy .", "It follows that , subject to the provisions on the voluntary termination of pregnancies and therapeutic abortions , the right to respect for every human being from the beginning of life is guaranteed by law , without any requirement that the child be born as a viable human being , provided it was alive when the injury occurred .", "Indeed , viability is a scientifically indefinite and uncertain concept , as the accused , who is currently studying in GPE , himself acknowledged , informing the ORG that foetuses born DATE after conception could now be kept alive , a situation that was inconceivable DATE . In the opinion prepared by Professor [ T. ] and adduced in evidence by Dr PERSON , reference is made to a report by Professor PERSON in which it is indicated that the embryo is merely the morphological expression of one and the same life that begins with impregnation and continues till death after passing through various stages . It is not yet known with precision when the zygote becomes an embryo and the embryo a foetus , the only indisputable fact being that the life process starts with impregnation . ...", "Thus the issue of viability at birth , a notion that is uncertain scientifically , is in addition devoid of all legal effect , as the law makes no distinction on that basis .", "In the instant case it has been established that when the scan was performed on CARDINAL DATE before the amniotic fluid was lost DATE the [ applicant \u2019s ] pregnancy had been proceeding normally and the child she was carrying was alive . When the therapeutic abortion was performed on DATE , it was noted that a comparison of the child \u2019s measurements with published tables suggested that the foetus was DATE and possibly older , as it is not certain that the tables take into account the specific morphology of children of NORP origin . Dr [ PERSON ] , when questioned on this point at the hearing , was unable to provide any further information . The conclusion from the anatomo - pathological examination was that the foetal lung indicated an age of DATE , its measurements suggesting that an age at the lower end of that range was the most likely . In any event , as Dr PERSON said in evidence , the age of the foetus was very close to that of certain foetuses that have managed to survive in GPE . The photographs at page D CARDINAL of the trial bundle show a perfectly formed child whose life was cut short by the accused \u2019s negligence .", "As ORG observed in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , had the assault on the child concerned inflicted a non - fatal wound , it would have been classified without any hesitation as an offence of unintentionally causing injuries . A fortiori , an assault leading to the child \u2019s death must be classified as unintentional homicide .", "Thus , the strict application of the legal principles , established scientific fact and elementary common sense all dictate that a negligent act or omission causing the death of DATE foetus in perfect health should be classified as unintentional homicide .", "Consequently , the impugned judgment must be overturned ...", "While [ the applicant \u2019s ] civil action is admissible , if only to corroborate the prosecution case , this ORG has no jurisdiction to hear the claim for reparation . This is because despite the serious nature of the negligent act and omission of Dr [ PERSON ] , a doctor in a public hospital , they do not constitute personal misconduct of such exceptional gravity entailing a total disregard for the most elementary principles and duties inherent in his function as to make them severable from public service .", "Nonetheless , it is appropriate to order Dr [ PERSON ] to pay to this civil party compensation in the sum of MONEY under LAW on account of costs which she has incurred , but which have not been paid by the ORG .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

These differences largely form the basis of most divergences around the other issues related to the protection of the embryo in vitro .", "Nevertheless , even if agreement can not be reached on the status of the embryo , the possibility of re - examining certain issues in the light of the latest developments in the biomedical field and related potential therapeutic advances could be considered . In this context , while acknowledging and respecting the fundamental choices made by the different countries , it seems possible and desirable with regard to the need to protect the embryo in vitro on which all countries have agreed , that common approaches be identified to ensure proper conditions for the application of procedures involving the creation and use of embryos in vitro . The purpose of this report is to aid reflection towards that objective . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG has issued , inter alia , the following opinion on the ethical aspects of research involving the use of human embryos in the context of the CARDINALth Framework Programme ( DATE ) :", "\u201c ...", "Legal background", "Controversies on the concept of beginning of life and \u2018 personhood\u2019", "Existing legislation in the Member GPE differs considerably from one another regarding the question of when life begins and about the definition of \u2018 personhood\u2019 . As a result , no consensual definition , neither scientifically nor legally , of when life begins exists .", "CARDINAL main views about the moral status of the embryo and thus regarding the legal protection afforded to them with respect to scientific research exist :", "( i ) NORP human embryos are not considered as human beings and consequently have a relative worth of protection ;", "( ii ) NORP human embryos have the same moral status as human beings and consequently are equally worthy of protection .", "The discussion of common rules on embryo research is continuing . Recently many NORP countries , when discussing and signing ORG , failed to reach a consensus concerning the definition of the embryo , and , therefore , were unable to find common ground on which to place the admissibility of human embryo research within the Convention . Hence , it is up to the Member States to legislate in this area . Yet , nevertheless , Article CARDINAL of the Convention stipulates \u2018 where the law allows research on embryos in vitro , it shall ensure adequate protection of the PERSON .", "...", "Different approaches regarding the definition of the human embryo", "In most Member GPE there is presently no legal definition of the human embryo ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . Among those Member GPE which define the embryo in their legislation , the existing definitions vary considerably from CARDINAL country to another ( GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) ...", "...", "Different scope of national legislation", "Among the Member GPE with legal provisions on embryo research , there are many differences regarding the activities allowed and prohibited .", "There are countries where embryo research is allowed only for the benefit of the particular embryo ( GPE , GPE ) . There are Member GPE where embryo research is exceptionally allowed ( GPE , GPE ) , or allowed under strict conditions ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ) .", "...", "Diversity of views", "The diversity of views regarding the question whether or not research on human embryos in vitro is morally acceptable , depends on differences in ethical approaches , philosophical theories and national traditions , which are deeply rooted in NORP culture . CARDINAL contrasting approaches exist : a deontological approach , in which duties and principles control the ends and consequences of our actions ; and utilitarian or consequentialist approaches in which human actions are evaluated in terms of means and ends or consequences .", "...", "The group submits the following opinion", "In the preamble it appeared crucial to recall that the progress of knowledge of life sciences , which in itself has an ethical value , can not , in any case , prevail over fundamental human rights and the respect which is due to all the members of the human family .", "The human embryo , whatever the moral or legal status conferred upon it in the different NORP cultures and ethical approaches , deserves legal protection . Even if taking into account the continuity of human life , this protection ought to be reinforced as the embryo and the foetus develop .", "The Treaty on European Union , which does not foresee legislative competence in the fields of research and medicine , implies that such protection falls within the competence of national legislation ( as is the case for medically assisted procreation and voluntary interruption of pregnancy ) . However , Community authorities should be concerned with ethical questions resulting from medical practice or research dealing with early human development .", "However , when doing so , the said Community authorities have to address these ethical questions taking into account the moral and philosophical differences , reflected by the extreme diversity of legal rules applicable to human embryo research , in DATE . It is not only legally difficult to seek harmonisation of national laws at Community level , but because of lack of consensus , it would be inappropriate to impose CARDINAL exclusive moral code .", "The respect for different philosophical , moral or legal approaches and for diverse national culture is essential to the building of LOC .", "From an ethical point of view , the multicultural character of NORP society requires mutual tolerance to be shown by the citizens and political figures of ORG that have chosen uniquely to tie their destiny together , while at the same time ensuring mutual respect for different historical traditions which are exceedingly strong .", "From a legal point of view , this multiculturalism is based upon LAW ( ex LAW ) which recognises fundamental rights at Union level notably based on \u2018 constitutional traditions common to the Member PERSON . It also declares that \u2018 the Union shall respect the national identity of its Member PERSON .", "It results from the aforementioned principles , that , in the scope of NORP research programmes , the question of research on the human embryo has to be approached , not only with regard to the respect for fundamental ethical principles , common to all Member GPE , but equally taking into consideration diverse philosophical and ethical conceptions , expressed through the practices and the national regulations in force in this field .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In GPE LAW makes it a criminal offence to cause damage to the foetus and LAW an offence to cause an abortion through gross negligence .
