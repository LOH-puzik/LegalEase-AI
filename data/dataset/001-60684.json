The applicant was born in DATE and lives at FAC ( in the province of GPE ) .", "She teaches history and geography at secondary - school level . From DATE to DATE she was the head teacher of a secondary school in ORG where she taught .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave notice through an advertisement in ORG of DATE of an internal competition to fill CARDINAL senior teaching posts at secondary - school level . On DATE ORG and ORG ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) published a provisional list of the candidates whose applications to take part in the competition had been accepted . The final list comprised CARDINAL candidates , including the applicant , and was published on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG published the candidates\u2019 assessments and the number of marks awarded to each under the chosen selection criteria , in order to allow any complaints to be lodged .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE , it published a final list of the candidates , including the applicant , who had passed the examination .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE CARDINAL candidates issued proceedings in ORG complaining about the manner in which the competition had been organised and , in particular , of the use of , and weighting given to , teacher - training diplomas in the assessment process , which they maintained was discriminatory . Notice of each individual application was published in ORG of the province of GPE . The national and regional press carried reports that a large number of legal actions had been brought complaining about the organisation and results of the competition and that senior officials in the NORP government or members of their families had passed the examination as a result of the significant weighting given to CARDINAL of the assessment criteria . The dispute was referred to the Ombudsman ( defensor del pueblo ) for GPE , who strongly criticised the weighting system and advised the NORP government to annul the competition . The teachers unions took a stand on the matter , which was also debated in the NORP parliament .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of the ORG dated DATE the applicant was appointed to the grade of senior history and geography secondary - school teacher .", "CARDINAL . In the judicial review proceedings that had been brought by a large number of candidates , ORG ordered the ORG to furnish a list of the candidates in the competition , to produce the administrative file and to serve notice on interested third parties to attend the hearing . ORG lodged written pleadings , but without identifying the interested third parties who ought to be summoned . At the end of the proceedings , in a judgment of DATE , ORG annulled the competition for history and geography teachers and directed the examiners to re - mark the examination papers without applying the disputed weighting .", "CARDINAL . NORP In other judicial review proceedings that had been brought in FAC on the same grounds , interested third parties , who had not been personally served with summonses to appear , made an application under LAW for leave to intervene after learning about the proceedings from other sources . ORG agreed to their participation in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On the reassessment of the candidates under the procedure laid down by ORG , the applicant did not attain the requisite level and failed the examination . ORG issued an order on DATE , which was published on DATE in ORG of ORG , annulling her appointment to the senior teaching post .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an amparo appeal with ORG under LAW ( right to a fair hearing ) against ORG judgment of DATE and the ORG \u2019s order of CARDINAL DATE . She said in her appeal that she had learnt of the notice in the DATE issue of ORG of ORG by accident and complained in substance that the process whereby her appointment to the senior teaching post had been annulled was unfair , as she had not been summoned to appear before ORG as an interested party to the dispute . In that connection , she argued , inter alia , that ORG had been under a duty under LAW to inform her of the court proceedings and to summon her to appear . She also sought a stay of execution of ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared her amparo appeal admissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant a stay of execution ; it discharged that order on DATE .", "CARDINAL . State Counsel lodged written pleadings with ORG on DATE concerning the amparo appeal . He argued that the appeal should be allowed in part , as there had been a violation of LAW for the following reasons :", "\u201c ... In order to examine this appeal , it is necessary to recapitulate the criteria and conditions laid down in the case - law of ORG establishing that a failure to serve a summons personally will violate the right to the effective protection of the courts .", "In that connection , the notion of \u2018 legitimate interest\u2019 has a special meaning for the purposes of LAW ( of LAW ) , as it determines who has a legitimate right to take part in court proceedings , that is to say standing as an interested party to bring an appeal .", "ORG has frequently stated that the notion of \u2018 legitimate interest ... is defined as an advantage or any legal benefit arising out of the remedy sought\u2019 ( judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In the present case , it will be seen that the appellant had a legitimate interest in the application before ORG , as she was liable to be affected by the judgment , which resulted in a new list of selected candidates being drawn up and , consequently , the loss of her newly obtained status as a senior secondary - school teacher . From that standpoint , therefore , it was vital for the summons to be served on her personally and directly in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , ... since the appellant was identifiable , it is necessary to determine whether she could have been served personally . In that connection , it will be observed from the pleadings lodged with ORG in support of the application for judicial review that it was not only the \u2018 ORG that was contested , but also the provisional list of candidates permitted to take part in the competition , which means that the persons concerned were readily identifiable .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , it was not only necessary , but also feasible , for the appellant to be summoned personally and directly . The last requirement is that the person concerned should have no knowledge of the proceedings . In the present case , there is no evidence to suggest that the appellant knew or could have found out about the proceedings , as the judgment was not even served on her . Accordingly , the rule established in ORG judgment no . DATE should be applied , namely : \u2018 this ORG will only dismiss the appeal if there is evidence establishing that the appellant was aware of the proceedings ... \u2019", "CARDINAL . In the light of the foregoing , in the present case , the appellant should have been summoned to appear in the judicial review proceedings in ORG . The fact that she was not so summoned put her in a position that was prejudicial to her defence rights , in breach of the fundamental right guaranteed by LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ordered the joinder of various amparo appeals against ORG judgment in which the appellants all relied on the same points of law .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on DATE after an adversarial hearing , ORG dismissed the amparo appeal .", "CARDINAL . With respect to the complaint that the annulment of the applicant \u2019s appointment to the senior teaching post was tainted with procedural unfairness , owing to the failure to summon her to appear before ORG as an interested party to the dispute , ORG held :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . NORP ... While it is true that the appellants allege , firstly , a violation of section CARDINAL of FAC on the ground that ORG effected service by advertisement and not personally , such a violation would only have a legal bearing on a constitutional amparo appeal if the breach of the LAW also constituted a violation of the fundamental right relied on ( see judgments LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL , legal reason no . CARDINAL ) . ORG addressed the issue of failure to summon third parties with an interest in judicial review proceedings in detail in its judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . The rules established in that case have been systematically recited , inter alia , in decisions delivered during DATE , in judgments nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; ORG ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; PERSON ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; PERSON ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; and CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) . As a general rule , the following CARDINAL conditions must be satisfied for amparo relief to be granted :", "( a ) The appellant must have a personal legitimate right or interest capable of being affected by the judicial review proceedings concerned ...", "( b ) It must be possible for the court or tribunal concerned to identify the appellant . Whether that requirement is satisfied will depend essentially on the information set out in the notice of application , the administrative file or the grounds of appeal ...", "( c ) Lastly , the appellant must have been a victim of a material infringement of his or her defence rights [ indefensi\u00f3n material ] . There will be no material infringement of defence rights if the person concerned has constructive notice of the proceedings and has not appeared through want of diligence . A finding that the person concerned had constructive notice of the proceedings must be based on reliable evidence [ fehaciente ] ( judgments nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; and CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ) . That does not prevent proof being established on the basis of presumptions ( judgments nos . DATE ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; and CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) . The presumption that the person concerned had notice will be particularly strong in cases concerning civil servants employed by an authority that is a defendant in the proceedings ( judgments LAW . CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ; and CARDINAL ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The application of the aforementioned constitutional parameters to the present case gives the following results :", "( a ) Firstly , the appellants indisputably had a legitimate interest ...", "( b ) Secondly , ... in the present case , ORG had precise details of the co - defendants or other parties , as the application for judicial review referred to the provisional list of the selected and unselected candidates ... and even the final list of candidates ...", "( c ) However , thirdly , as to whether there has been a material infringement of the rights of the defence , this Court held in its judgment no . PERSON ( legal reason no . CARDINAL ) that it was reasonable to presume that teachers had constructive notice of judicial review proceedings when , as in the present case , they had been appointed to their senior teaching posts following a competition that had been challenged in the administrative courts , had attracted extensive media coverage and had had an important impact in trade - union circles ...", "We reach the same conclusion in the present case . A number of articles on the proceedings challenging the scale used in the competition ( and the list of candidates selected to take part ) have appeared in large circulation newspapers in GPE ( the case has received extensive coverage in PERSON ( GPE ) , ORG ( PERSON edition ) , PERSON , GPE , PERSON and PERSON ) ) . The underlying issues were also examined by the NORP parliament at a briefing session ( held on DATE ) . In DATE ORG and ORG sent a memorandum to the teachers via the \u2018 ORG Office\u2019 expressly informing them of the proceedings pending in ORG . To these considerations must be added the subjective characteristics common to all the applicants : they are all civil servants employed by the defendant authority ; as teachers , they are in a category of the population that has frequent access to the media , particularly the press . Lastly , the number of people affected by the appeals is very high ( CARDINAL teachers entered the competition and CARDINAL were selected in a very specific functional environment ( teaching ) ) . In the light of the foregoing , we reach the clear conclusion that the appellants had constructive notice of the judicial review proceedings that were heard by ORG in GPE . Consequently , their failure to take part in those proceedings was not attributable to any lack of diligence by that ORG . Accordingly , there has been no violation of the right to the protection of the courts ( LAW ) . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone shall have the right to the effective protection of the judges and courts in the exercise of his rights and legitimate interests and shall never be left defenceless .", "CARDINAL . Likewise , everyone shall have the right of access to a judge of ordinary jurisdiction , as predetermined by law , to defend himself and to be assisted by a lawyer , to be informed of the charges against him , to have a public trial without undue delay and attended by all safeguards , to use the evidence relevant to his defence , not to incriminate himself , not to admit guilt and to be presumed innocent .", "... \u201d", "\u201c Everyone appearing to have an interest in the dispute shall be immediately informed of any decision by the authority that issued the relevant instrument or provision to forward the administrative file to the court and summoned within DATE to attend the hearing ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In a series of judgments published in ORG of the ORG , ORG has established the legal principles applicable to cases in which interested third parties have not been personally served with summonses requiring their appearance in judicial review proceedings to which they were not parties ( see section CARDINAL of FAC ) . A detailed summary of the rules is to be found in ORG judgment of DATE in the present case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "It is the settled case - law of ORG that anyone with constructive notice of and a legitimate personal interest in judicial review proceedings who has not been personally served with a summons to take part in those proceedings may apply to the court for leave to do so by virtue of LAW . A number of interested parties were given leave to intervene in some of the applications for judicial review heard by ORG challenging the assessment criteria used by the authority ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
