NORP The applicant 's son PERSON was killed in a road traffic accident on DATE in GPE . He was travelling in the car with : PERSON , PERSON , who was taken by ambulance to FAC , where she died TIME after intensive surgery ; PERSON , the driver of the vehicle , who died on the spot ; and Mr PERSON 's bodyguard , PERSON , who was seriously injured .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the public prosecutor and Professor PERSON , the requisitioned forensic pathologist , Chief Inspector Mules , a senior police officer with the serious crime squad , was present when the body of PERSON underwent an external forensic examination , at TIME , with no taking of body samples , and the officer was provided with the pathologist 's report at TIME During DATE , following an official ceremony , the coffin was conveyed in a cortege to Villacoublay airport , after a burial permit had been issued and the NORP authorities had made the necessary arrangements for repatriation of the body to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The body of the applicant 's son was taken to ORG for an examination by Professor PERSON , with the assistance of Chief Inspector PERSON . The police officer 's report mentioned that the pathologist 's report had been given to him at TIME and that \u201c blood , urine and other usual samples \u201d had been taken .", "CARDINAL . NORP The pathologist 's report concerning the autopsy on the driver 's body was given to Chief Inspector PERSON at TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor of GPE applied for the opening of a judicial investigation in respect of charges of unintentional homicide and wounding and failure to assist a person in danger . The case was assigned to an investigating judge at the GPE tribunal de grande instance and a second investigating judge was appointed later in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE from CARDINAL of his lawyers , the applicant applied to join the proceedings as a civil party .", "CARDINALand in particular the press photographers ' insistent and intense activity which culminated in their pursuit of the car in which the victims were travelling , CARDINAL photographers were placed under judicial investigation on charges of unintentional homicide and wounding and failure to assist a person in danger .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Chief Inspector PERSON drafted a report stating that , contrary to the indication on the report drawn up on DATE of the autopsy , no samples had been taken from the body of the applicant 's son and that the forensic pathologist had only carried out an external examination of the body in accordance with the instructions received .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge requested Professor PERSON to provide all useful indications for the purpose of establishing whether or not the injuries on the bodies of the CARDINAL victims had been such as to have resulted in their instantaneous death .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a report of DATE Professor PERSON indicated that an external examination of the body of PERSON could not by itself provide the answer to that question and that it would be necessary to examine the records of the emergency paramedics ( the ORG ) present at the scene of the accident and the autopsy report . The expert pathologist also considered that the external examination of PERSON body and her surgical treatment were not sufficient either and that only an autopsy could provide additional information concerning organs .", "CARDINAL . It was also stated by the applicant that , from the beginning of the investigation , the investigating judge had decided to make enquiries in order to identify a vehicle and its driver that had been involved in the accident according to witnesses and in the light of technical analysis by the national gendarmerie . Those enquiries were discontinued in the course of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge appointed Professors PERSON and PERSON as experts with the following assignments : to apprise themselves of all current and future material in the case file , documents from medical records to be obtained in GPE and any useful medical documents that might be forthcoming from the NORP authorities ; to provide any useful medical indications , in particular on the exact causes , circumstances and precise time of the deaths and on the treatment dispensed at the scene of the crash ; and , as regards PERSON , to indicate what treatment was given to her in the ambulance and then at the hospital , and whether it was in conformity with current medical knowledge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge supplemented the experts ' assignment by authorising them to hear representations from any person other than those under judicial investigation and giving them the opportunity to consult specially qualified persons for the purpose of completing their assignment .", "CARDINAL . In their report of CARDINAL DATE the CARDINAL experts noted in particular that there had been no determination of blood group or biological examination in respect of PERSON . They further indicated that they had visited GPE on DATE to apprise themselves of the particulars of her autopsy and that they had met CARDINAL doctors and a senior police officer during that visit . They had been informed by a forensic pathologist there that the description of the injuries had been made difficult by the fact that the body had been embalmed before departure from GPE . Moreover , the CARDINAL NORP experts mentioned that copies of the autopsy reports had been given to them \u201c on a personal basis \u201d . The applicant indicated that since the documents had been supplied \u201c on a personal basis \u201d they had not been added by the experts to the case file .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further alleged that there had been a persistent rumour , relayed by numerous press articles and a certain number of published books that had been added to the investigation file , to the effect that the NORP and GPE intelligence services had possessed material information on the circumstances surrounding the death of his son and the other passengers in the car . The applicant pointed out that , according to a number of documents in the investigation file , the judge had also received information to that effect from ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge examined PERSON , a former officer of the NORP intelligence service MICARDINAL . PERSON complemented his statements by letters dated DATE and DATE . In his letter of DATE he mentioned the involvement of CARDINAL counsellors at FAC in GPE , who were presumed to be members of MICARDINAL . In another letter of DATE he informed the judge that he had recently become aware of a new fact that might be of interest for the investigation into the deaths of PERSON and PERSON . That letter was not followed up and PERSON 's lawyer in turn wrote , without success , to the investigating judge to seek the examination of his client .", "CARDINAL . The investigating judge sent CARDINAL letters , on CARDINAL and DATE to the Secretary for ORG at FAC in GPE . The Secretary replied on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant considered that there had not been any precise response , still less any statement under oath , concerning : the possibility , referred to by PERSON , that PERSON had been a correspondent for NORP intelligence ; the presence in GPE at the material time of the CARDINAL above - mentioned counsellors to ORG in GPE ; and the presence of an unknown person , claiming to be a NORP photographer , seen in front of the ORG before the departure of the vehicle by the photographers under investigation . Accordingly , he called for the examination of the CARDINAL Embassy counsellors and the Secretary for ORG , in order to shed light on certain questions . He also sought the examination of representatives from ORG ( ORG ) , which he claimed had a file concerning surveillance of PERSON . The applicant added that an official letter from the ORG confirmed the existence of such surveillance and of a CARDINAL,CARDINAL-page file on the subject .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of DATE the investigating judge dismissed a request for additional investigative measures made by the applicant on DATE concerning the damaged vehicle , certain calls made by mobile phone at the material time and the area covered by cell sites . The judge also dismissed a request from PERSON and PERSON , submitted on DATE , also concerning mobile phones and the damaged vehicle but also seeking an additional expert 's report on the level of carboxyhaemoglobin observed in their son 's blood .", "CARDINAL . By notice of CARDINAL DATE the judges investigating the unintentional homicide charges informed the applicant 's counsel that their investigation appeared to be at an end and that they intended to transmit the case file to the public prosecutor . Counsel for the applicant replied in a letter and note dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judges dismissed the requests for examination of members of ORG and the ORG . They also dismissed a request from PERSON and PERSON for a confrontation with experts . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG of ORG upheld the decisions of DATE and DATE dismissing the requests for investigative measures .", "CARDINAL . In another judgment of DATE , ORG of ORG upheld the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judges discontinued the proceedings against all the individuals under investigation . They also dismissed a request from Mr and PERSON seeking the restitution of certain samples taken from their son 's body .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel for the applicant wrote a letter to the public prosecutor at the GPE tribunal de grande instance seeking to ascertain : the reasons why the case file did not contain PERSON autopsy report , which had been given to the NORP experts by their NORP counterparts and information as to its destination ; the circumstances in which the Princess ' body had been embalmed while still in GPE and the reasons for that measure , with its prejudicial consequences for a subsequent autopsy ; whether or not samples had been taken from the body of his son , in view of the corrective statement of DATE , and from that of PERSON , having regard to the examinations carried out in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE the public prosecutor declared the requests inadmissible , having regard to the judicial investigation , the discontinuance decision and the referral of the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG of ORG upheld the discontinuance decision . Moreover , it held that the samples taken for analysis in the course of judicial proceedings were not covered by the provisions on restitution in LAW . After noting that the request called into question the blood analyses , the court found that the requested action was not necessary for discovery of the truth , since the results of those analyses were not such as to exonerate from criminal responsibility any third party or parties that may have contributed to the damage .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG ordered the return to the investigating judge of the case file opened on the basis of a complaint , with civil - party application , for unlawful invasion of privacy , requiring the judge to continue his investigation speedily as \u201c the court [ could not ] but deplore the lack of activity for DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the urgent applications judge of the GPE tribunal de grande instance dismissed a similar request from ORG , on the ground that only the criminal court which had ordered that those samples be administered by the courts was competent to order their restitution or to appoint an expert for their examination . The applicant considered that this decision contained a contradiction as it referred to a letter dated DATE from ORG at ORG to the parents of PERSON in which they had been assured that the samples would be retained for the subsequent proceedings , whilst it also quoted the said expert 's comment on \u201c the total unreliability of the blood alcohol analyses DATE after the samples were taken \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision . An appeal on points of law was lodged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON and PERSON filed a criminal complaint with civil - party application for the falsification of data by the CARDINAL court - appointed experts responsible for analysing the samples taken from their son 's body , on account of failure to comply with the statutory procedures for taking samples and with conservation requirements , and in respect of subsequent work . Their complaint was based above all on the statements of CARDINAL of those experts in the course of civil proceedings and on the results of a private analysis carried out by ORG , GPE and PERSON , who had indicated a certain number of major shortcomings in the forensic examinations .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , of which notice was given on DATE , ORG declared inadmissible the applicant 's appeal on points of law in respect of the third and fourth grounds of appeal ( challenging the judgment upholding the dropping of charges of unintentional homicide and failure to assist a person in danger ) , on the basis of LAW . ORG dismissed the first ground of appeal ( concerning the fact that the principal investigating judge and his deputy were joint signatories of the discontinuance decision ) and the second ( concerning the refusal to join these proceedings to those arising from the applicant 's criminal complaint and civil - party application of DATE for the offence of unlawful invasion of privacy committed against his son and PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a decision refusing investigative measures was made in the context of the investigation opened following the criminal complaint filed by PERSON and PERSON on DATE for falsification of data , proceedings in which the applicant had applied for civil - party status . Subsequently , in a judgment of DATE ORG of ORG reclassified a discontinuance decision of DATE as a decision not to open an investigation and ordered the continuation of the investigation by the judge assigned to the case . On DATE ORG granted an application by the applicant to disqualify the court from hearing the case on grounds of apprehended bias and transferred the case to the GPE tribunal de grande instance for the judicial investigation , which is still in progress .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the letter in which the applicant applied for civil - party status in the judicial investigation opened that same day in respect of unintentional homicide and wounding and failure to assist a person in danger , he further indicated as follows :", "\u201c ... presumably because a public prosecution may only be brought on the basis of a criminal complaint by the victim , his representative or his heirs , in accordance with the provisions of LAW , the originating application for a judicial investigation does not refer to the offence of attempted invasion of privacy , as provided for and punishable under ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW , whereas it appears to me that such a charge is made out , as the photographers who were pursuing the vehicle before it crashed clearly intended to take photographs invading the privacy of PERSON and PERSON .", "The prosecution of that offence is crucial , in so far as it had continuously been committed by the photographers throughout DATE , but also , and above all , after the couple had left FAC and during the pursuit , of which the route , via the Alma underpass in particular , can be attributed solely to that pursuit .", "The acts constituting that offence , in so far as they played a major part in the organisation of the departure from the hotel and in the driving of the car , form the initial and decisive element in the causal chain that led to the death of the CARDINAL victims .", "I therefore submit to you an additional application by Mr PERSON , in his capacity as heir of Mr PERSON , to be granted civil - party status in respect of the charge of attempted invasion of privacy , on the basis of LAW , kindly requesting you to transmit the file to the public prosecutor with a view to obtaining his authorisation for the extension of the judicial investigation to encompass that charge ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as no reply to that request had been received , the applicant lodged with the senior investigating judge a criminal complaint , together with a civil - party application , for the criminal offence of unlawful invasion of privacy . He reiterated his arguments , emphasising the close connection between the subject - matter of this complaint and that of the investigation by the investigating judges , opened on DATE , and indicated \u201c that it [ would ] therefore [ be ] particularly appropriate , for the proper administration of justice \u201d , to entrust the complaint to the same judges by joining the CARDINAL sets of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The judicial investigation in respect of that complaint was entrusted to CARDINAL of the CARDINAL judges responsible for the investigation opened on DATE , but the CARDINAL sets of proceedings were not joined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE representations from the applicant were heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's counsel wrote to the investigating judge to point out that the judge 's inactivity in the investigation in respect of the complaint of CARDINAL DATE \u201c could be understood to the extent that the joinder of those proceedings with the main set of proceedings [ had been ] envisaged \u201d , and to reiterate his request for joinder , in view of the lack of investigative measures , informing the judge that he would otherwise refer the matter to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge issued a warrant for purposes of \u201c making enquiries to determine comprehensively the particulars of the offence and to identify all perpetrators , co - perpetrators and accomplices \u201d , without any other indication as to the required measures .", "CARDINAL . In a note of CARDINAL DATE , drafted in response to the notice of CARDINAL DATE in the other proceedings , the applicant 's counsel dwelt at length on the facts that characterised the offence of unlawful invasion of privacy with which the photographers could be charged , and pointed out the case - law to the effect that such a charge was made out when photographs were taken through the windows of a private vehicle , adding that , on account of the inseverable nature of the facts , it was necessary to join the proceedings , as had been requested on several occasions , and that joinder would likewise be justified \u201c if the investigating judges were to consider that the charge of unlawful invasion of privacy was actually made out by the findings of their principal investigation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The police officers to whom the warrant had been addressed reported back to the investigating judge on DATE , DATE after the discontinuance decision of DATE in the investigation concerning the unintentional homicide charge . From DATE , the date of referral to them , until DATE , the date of their transmission report , the police officers drew up CARDINAL reports simply concerning the contacts they had had with the investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the examination of the photographers whose presence at the scene of the accident had been established in the first investigation . His request having remained unanswered , he referred the matter to ORG by an application of DATE .", "CARDINAL . That ORG examined the case file on DATE . In the course of the hearing the applicant learned from the public prosecutor 's submissions that the case file contained only a copy of the discontinuance decision of DATE and , moreover , that it had not been accompanied by a record of joinder of documents .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the case file having been transmitted to ORG without a copy first being made or kept , the applicant 's counsel was unable to consult the file in the investigating judge 's office after the hearing of DATE in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought proceedings against the Government Law Officer ( agent judiciaire du Tr\u00e9sor ) to obtain a ruling that the ORG 's responsibility was engaged on account of gross negligence and denial of justice in the handling of his criminal complaint of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG of ORG ordered the return of the case file to the investigating judge in GPE for the continuation of the judicial investigation , with in particular the examination of certain expressly named individuals . In its judgment ORG found in particular as follows :", "\u201c An examination of the case file reveals that , with the exception of representations from the civil party and a warrant upon which no action was taken , the successive investigating judges took no other investigative measure .", "Contrary to the indications of counsel for the civil party , this case file does not contain a copy of the investigation file in respect of the charges of unintentional homicide and wounding and failure to assist a person in danger , but only a copy of the discontinuance decision .", "... Under these circumstances it is appropriate to return the case file to the investigating judge in order that , notwithstanding the workload of his office , he should continue the investigation speedily ... ; the court can not but deplore the lack of activity for DATE ... \u201d", "DATE . On DATE the GPE tribunal de grande instance , ruling in the context of the proceedings brought on DATE , dismissed the applicant 's complaint . He appealed against this judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge issued a decision of partial discontinuance in respect of CARDINAL of the individuals under investigation and ordered that CARDINAL other photographers be committed to stand trial before ORG for unlawful invasion of privacy . The case was set down for hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG reversed the judgment of DATE , finding that the responsibility of the ORG was engaged on account of gross negligence in the administration of justice and of a denial of justice . Its main findings read as follows :", "\u201c ... from the outset , it was established that the CARDINAL judicial investigations opened were connected ; the Government Law Officer , who accepts this , also acknowledges that ' the results of CARDINAL and its procedural developments naturally influenced the conducting of the other ' .", "Accordingly , whilst the investigating judge is not obliged , procedurally speaking , to order the joinder requested insistently by PERSON , the decision not to join the investigations DATE a measure of judicial administration left to the judge 's discretion \u2013 is nevertheless part of the series of facts relied upon by the appellant in support of his claims .", "Mr PERSON is justified in observing that , in deciding on the discontinuance of the unintentional homicide investigation , the investigating judge made an assessment of the facts set out in the complaint submitted to him for the second investigation ...", "As has been claimed quite rightly by PERSON , it transpires that , in order to assess criminal responsibility in the first investigation , it was necessary to examine the reality of the facts involved in the second and the potential classification of those facts as a criminal offence could not be indifferent to the first . Accordingly , contrary to the argument of the Government Law Officer it was not appropriate to carry out CARDINAL successive investigations .", "...", "The inactivity of the successive judges ... was noted by this court in its judgment of DATE , when it found that it could not ' but deplore the lack of activity for DATE .", "...", "It transpires from these findings that the judges responsible for conducting the CARDINAL investigations into connected facts , while refusing to join the investigations , omitted for DATE to take any investigative measures in respect of Mr PERSON complaint .", "...", "Contrary to the argument of the Government Law Officer and contrary to the findings of the court below , the conduct of the investigating judges can not be explained by the fact that the investigations carried out in the first set of proceedings were capable of ensuring progress in the second set , and thus that it was out of a concern for efficiency in establishing the truth that the investigating judges gave priority to investigative measures concerning the unintentional wounding and homicide charges and adopted a strategy which resulted in their investigating the CARDINAL cases successively .", "It has been noted , first of all , that the outcome of the second investigation was not indifferent to the first . Contrary to the argument of the Government Law Officer , the results of the investigations opened on charges of unintentional homicide and wounding and failure to assist a person in danger were certainly not decisive for the continuation of the proceedings concerning unlawful invasion of privacy . In addition , if the investigations conducted were useful to both sets of proceedings , the refusal to join them can not be explained . Moreover , if that were the case , it was necessary to add to the case file of the second investigation any documents from the first that might be useful for the judicial investigation into the allegation of unlawful invasion of privacy , but this was only done after the bringing of the present proceedings . In this connection , the fact that the discontinuance decision was added to the case file was not sufficient to enable the investigation to progress , absent any other document . Lastly , when the judges had informed Mr PERSON that they considered the investigation opened on the unintentional homicide charge to be at an end , and then gave a decision of discontinuance , they had still not taken any measures in the other proceedings , the warrant having been issued with no prospect of execution for the reasons mentioned above .", "The above facts reveal the inability of the public service to fulfil the mission vested in it , in so far as they led the civil party to believe that the judicial investigation in respect of his complaint had been impeded and that not all the investigative measures required for the establishment of responsibility in the death of his son had been taken , especially as , far from losing interest in the case or obstructing the discovery of the truth , Mr PERSON , through the intervention of his lawyers , was proposing that the judges proceed with detailed analysis of the facts by making use , in particular , of evidence gleaned in the unintentional homicide investigation , and was complaining of the ' regrettable separation ' between the QUANTITY investigations , the joinder of which he did not cease to demand .", "In particular , these facts reveal a breach by the judiciary of their obligation to ensure that victims are informed and that their rights are guaranteed throughout any criminal proceedings , as provided for by LAW , together with an infringement of the right of all members of the public to have meaningful and effective access to a court and to have their case heard within a reasonable time .", "Although in the present case the proceedings nevertheless continued , that does not make good the shortcomings observed , since it was only after the action to establish ORG responsibility and the decision of ORG , ruling on an application from the civil party following the investigating judge 's refusal to take the requested investigative measures , that the judicial investigation was effectively pursued , such that the civil party is justified in believing that if he had not taken those procedural initiatives the inactivity of the judges , even though they had been properly seised of the case , would have continued .", "In addition to the gross negligence there has been a denial of justice . Contrary to the findings of the court below , the fact ' that through the normal operation of the institutions and in particular of the appeal mechanism and the possibility of review by ORG , the complainant has secured vindication of his rights and the continuation of the proceedings in the proper conditions ' and that , the proceedings having been resumed , the case has been set down for hearing in ORG on DATE , does not suffice to cure the denial of justice .", "The latter is characterised by the unjustified inactivity of the judges for DATE , which led to a delay in the investigation of the case assigned to them , bearing in mind that the proceedings were only resumed as a result of the complainant 's initiatives . There was consequently a delay in the examination of the case by the court , which did not take place until DATE after the filing of the complaint and civil - party application , a period that does not constitute a reasonable time in the present case .", "The responsibility of the ORG is therefore engaged .", "On account of Mr PERSON inevitable loss of confidence in the judicial institution responsible for elucidating the circumstances of his son 's death , as a result of the said shortcomings , even though they occurred in the context of the proceedings concerning the offence of unlawful invasion of privacy , he has sustained non - pecuniary damage for which full compensation is to be awarded in the sum of MONEY ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the CARDINAL defendants , finding that the photographs taken after the accident , firstly , had not captured any intimate gesture or conduct , especially bearing in mind that the relationship between the applicant 's son and PERSON had been widely reported in the media and , secondly , could not be regarded as having been taken in a private place because the emergency services were present , tending to the wounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment on the basis of LAW , finding in particular that ORG had not sufficiently addressed the civil party 's submissions concerning the lack of consent on the part of the victim , and that neither the presence of emergency services nor a crash victim 's involuntary exposure to the public eye could deprive the vehicle carrying the victim of its private nature . It remitted the case to be heard by a different bench of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the CARDINAL photographers to pay the applicant the sum of MONEY in damages and to have notice of the judgment published .
