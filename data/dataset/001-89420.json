The applicant associations are religious associations or meditation associations belonging to the PERSON movement , formerly known as the PERSON or PERSON movement . The movement was founded by the NORP mystic PERSON , who was first called PERSON by his followers , and then later PERSON . According to their statutes , the applicant associations promote the teachings of PERSON , who maintained that the aim of spiritual development was enlightenment . CARDINAL precondition was to become free of all socialisation , through a comprehensive programme of traditional and new meditation techniques and a range of therapies . The applicant associations run PERSON meditation centres , organise seminars , celebrate religious events and carry out joint work projects . They also protect the religious rights of their members against discrimination .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant associations belong to a group of previously unknown religious communities which first surfaced in GPE in DATE . They were described as \u201c sects \u201d , \u201c youth sects \u201d , \u201c youth religions \u201d , \u201c psycho - sects \u201d , and \u201c psycho - groups \u201d or given similar labels . The groups quickly became the subject of critical public debate due to the fact that their actions are seen to be predominantly influenced by their religious and philosophical views and due to the way they treat their members and followers . The focus of concern was the potential danger that these groups could pose to adolescents\u2019 personal development and social relations , which could lead not only to their dropping out of school and vocational training , radical changes in personality , various forms of dependence , lack of initiative and difficulties in communication , often aggravated by the group structure characteristic of certain communities , but also to material loss and psychological harm .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE ORG and the governments of the ORG have been confronted with these issues . To draw attention to the potential dangers of such groups , both to the individual and to society , ORG launched a large - scale information and education campaign designed to increase public awareness and stimulate a critical discussion on the aims and activities of sects and sectarian groups . Since DATE ORG has given several official warnings concerning so - called sects with a view to informing the public about the practice of these groups . The PERSON , or PERSON , movement was mentioned as one of these new religious and spiritual movements . As part of their public relations work , ORG agencies have characterised the applicant associations as a \u201c sect \u201d , \u201c youth sect \u201d , \u201c youth religion \u201d and \u201c psycho - sect \u201d . The adjectives \u201c destructive \u201d and \u201c pseudo - religious \u201d have also been used to describe them , and the accusation has been raised that their members are manipulated .", "CARDINAL . These expressions were contained in Government statements , namely , in replies to members of ORG DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE , in a report by ORG to ORG on youth sects in GPE dated DATE and published by the Federal Minister of ORG , ORG , and in a speech by the Federal Minister of ORG , ORG delivered on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the reply of DATE on the subject \u201c Recent religious and philosophical communities ( so - called youth sects ) \u201d the \u201c PERSON Movement \u201d was counted among the so - called religious and philosophical communities . ORG stated that these were labelled with general terms such as \u201c youth sects \u201d , \u201c destructive religious groups \u201d or \u201c destructive cults \u201d . ORG itself referred to them as \u201c youth sects \u201d \u201c pseudo - religious and psycho - groups \u201d as well as generally referring to them as \u201c sects \u201d .", "In their reply dated DATE the Government mentioned the \u201c PERSON movement \u201d in connection with questions concerning the membership structure of \u201c so - called new youth sects \u201d . Furthermore , in the preliminary remarks the term \u201c so - called psycho - sects \u201d was used , while throughout the main text the Government referred to \u201c youth religions \u201d .", "In their reply of DATE concerning the \u201c economic activities of destructive youth religions and psycho - sects \u201d the Government mainly used the terms \u201c youth religion \u201d and \u201c psycho - sect \u201d . The Government further stated that it appeared to be difficult to apply labour law regulations to associations the conduct of whose members was manipulated .", "In its report to ORG of DATE ORG pointed out in the introduction that the terms \u201c youth religion \u201d or \u201c youth sect \u201d encompassed a number of highly varied groups . The \u201c group based around \u201c PERSON ( i.e. God ) PERSON \u201d was presented as one of these groups , and was included as one of the \u201c psycho - movements \u201d .", "In the speech he gave on DATE at a conference on the topic \u201c New youth religions \u2013 Protecting the freedom of the individual \u201d the Federal Minister of Youth , ORG used the terms \u201c youth religion \u201d , \u201c youth sect \u201d , \u201c sect \u201d , \u201c destructive religious cults \u201d , \u201c pseudo salvation teachings \u201d and \u201c pseudo - religion \u201d with reference to the groups dealt with .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant associations instituted legal proceedings before ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) . They requested that the Government desist from issuing the above - mentioned statements about the religious movement and the associations belonging to it , maintaining that such statements were incriminating . They essentially alleged that their freedom to profess a religious or philosophical creed under LAW ) had been infringed .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant associations , the teachings of the community were based on the idea of achieving transcendence in all essential areas of life . These teachings were continuously shared by them and their community . The various statements of the Government had breached the obligation of neutrality required by LAW by discrediting the teachings of the movement . The expressions used were either actually defamatory or were meant to be , and there was no factual or legal basis which would justify using those terms . The applicant associations did not pursue any activities contrary to the basic rights of other persons , groups or organisations . The Government had misinterpreted the concepts of PERSON \u2019s teachings and thus interfered with the essential religious beliefs of their movement .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG prohibited the Government from calling the PERSON movement in official statements a \u201c youth religion \u201d , \u201c youth sect \u201d or \u201c psycho - sect \u201d , from using the adjectives \u201c destructive \u201d and \u201c pseudo - religious \u201d and from alleging that members of the PERSON movement had been manipulated .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that those terms evoked a negative connotation of the basic contents of the applicant associations\u2019 religious beliefs and that the use of those terms infringed their religious freedom guaranteed by LAW . It considered , however , that the use of the term \u201c sect \u201d as such had no negative impact on the applicant associations\u2019 religious belief .", "CARDINAL . ORG pointed out that there was no indication that the applicant associations pursued exclusively commercial aims or that the teachings of PERSON or the methods employed by the applicant associations were contrary to human dignity . The right protected by LAW obliged the ORG to maintain strict neutrality regarding religious activities and prohibited negative judgments on a determined religious belief . Furthermore the use of such general terms was not appropriate for the prevention of danger .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government appealed against that judgment . A hearing was held before ORG of the Land GPE ( PERSON das ORG ) on CARDINAL DATE . By a judgment of DATE ORG quashed the impugned judgment and dismissed the applicant associations\u2019 claim as a whole , as well as the appeals of CARDINAL applicant associations who had contested the findings of the first - instance court as regards the use of the term \u201c sect \u201d . It did not allow an appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the contested statements interfered with the applicant associations\u2019 basic rights guaranteed by LAW and CARDINAL of LAW . However , the right to religious freedom was not absolute . It was subject to limitations by other provisions of LAW Limitations and interferences by the ORG had to be accepted where important reasons of public interest required the protection of basic rights which were in conflict with the right to freedom of religion . Where a mere suspicion of a possible violation of these rights existed , relevant information and warnings were appropriate and necessary for their protection . Under LAW , which vested governmental functions in the Government , taken together with the positive obligations under LAW , first sentence , which guarantees the right to life and to inviolability of the person , and LAW , which protects the rights of the family , the Government had the right to impart information . The views expressed by the Government were acceptable and respected the principle of proportionality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed the applicant ORG appeal against the decision of ORG refusing leave to appeal . The court considered that the case had no fundamental importance . It noted that the legal questions raised in connection with public declarations of the Government in respect of new religious movements had already been dealt with in its previous case - law and that of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) . The applicant associations\u2019 submissions did not raise any new issue . The Government \u2019s constitutional right to inform the public and to protect the human dignity and health of citizens justified the interference with the freedom of religion or belief . The right to inform the public included the right to warn the public and to consider the conduct of others as dangerous .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant associations filed a constitutional complaint against the above - mentioned court decisions . On DATE ORG informed the applicant associations in reply to their letter of DATE that it was not able to indicate when a decision would be given . On DATE it wrote to the applicant associations that the case had been communicated to ORG and ORG . On DATE ORG submitted their observations , which were served on the applicant associations on DATE . On DATE the applicant associations submitted their observations in reply . By letters of CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE the applicant associations enquired about the state of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled that the judgment of ORG of ORG of DATE violated the applicant associations\u2019 basic rights guaranteed by LAW and CARDINAL of LAW . It quashed the judgment insofar as the applicant associations\u2019 claim had been dismissed in respect of the use of the expressions \u201c destructive \u201d , and \u201c pseudo - religious \u201d , and the allegation that they \u201c manipulated their members \u201d and referred that part of the complaint back to ORG for a new decision . However , it found that the Government was authorised to characterise the applicant associations\u2019 movement as a \u201c sect \u201d , \u201c youth religion \u201d , \u201c youth sect \u201d and \u201c psycho - sect \u201d and was allowed to provide the public with adequate information about it .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the right to freedom of religion or belief guaranteed by LAW and CARDINAL of LAW did not prevent the ORG from entering into a public and even critical discussion about the aims and activities of religious groups . The limitations on the freedom of religion were to be found in other basic rights and freedoms guaranteed by LAW , such as the protection of human dignity , the right to life and physical integrity and the protection of marriage and the family .", "CARDINAL . The power to manage ORG affairs derived directly from LAW and authorised ORG to provide information in all matters coming within the sphere of their overall ORG responsibility . Providing direct public information helped them to resolve conflicts within the ORG and society , to face challenges even if they occurred at short notice , to react quickly and adequately to the problems and concerns of citizens and assist them in finding guidance . This activity did not require an express legal provision , since it did not constitute a direct interference with the applicant associations\u2019 rights . It merely influenced the conduct of others vis - \u00e0 - vis the applicant associations . Moreover , it was not possible to establish rules for the Government \u2019s information - imparting role , given the wide variety of the subject matter dealt with and methods used . When acting in the exercise of their power to direct ORG affairs , ORG were entitled to provide information to the public , even if basic rights were indirectly affected as a result .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the ORG had to restrict itself to neutral terms and act with moderation in matters of religion or belief . Defamatory , discriminating or deceptive statements were prohibited . The ORG also had to respect the separation of powers between ORG and the ORG . The Government were authorised to impart information relating to supra - regional matters and where nationwide information helped to resolve problems efficiently . Providing information in these circumstances did not exclude or impair the powers of the LOC governments to impart information themselves , nor did it prevent the administrative authorities from carrying out their administrative tasks .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG had to respect the principle of proportionality when imparting information . Statements affecting the very essence of the right guaranteed by LAW and CARDINAL of LAW had to be appropriate in relation to the cause for concern .", "CARDINAL . As to the term \u201c sect \u201d , ORG found that the Government were not prohibited from using the term , which at the material time corresponded to the general understanding of new religious movements . Similarly , the use of the terms \u201c youth religion \u201d and \u201c youth sect \u201d described the prevailing situation at the material time and the term \u201c psycho - sect \u201d reflected the PERSON movement \u2019s meditation practices . These terms were employed without discriminatory differences of treatment in respect of these groups on grounds of their religion or belief . They complied with the obligation of the ORG to neutrality in matters of religious and philosophical beliefs and did not affect the very essence of the right guaranteed by LAW and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In contrast , the use of the terms \u201c destructive \u201d and \u201c pseudo- religious \u201d , and the allegation that members of the movement were manipulated , did not satisfy the requirements of constitutional law .", "CARDINAL . Even if the employment of such terms could not be criticised on the ground that it exceeded the powers of ORG , the terms used nonetheless infringed the neutrality requirement and were thus not justifiable according to the proportionality principle . In particular , no substantiated reasons had been advanced which could have justified the statements regarded as defamatory by the complainants , nor were any such reasons otherwise apparent . That decision was served on the applicant associations on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG withdrew their appeal against the judgment of ORG of DATE as the appeal was again pending before ORG following the decision of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant associations\u2019 representative informed the ORG that the fourth and fifth applicant associations , ORG f\u00fcr ganzheitliches PERSON . PERSON and PERSON ORG . V , wished to withdraw their application .", "CARDINAL .

By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ruled that ORG was entitled to provide information and publish warnings by virtue of their constitutional responsibility to inform the public about new religious and ideological communities and \u201c psycho - groups \u201d ( BVerwGE CARDINAL C CARDINAL/CARDINAL , see Judgments and Decisions of ORG , vol . CARDINAL , pp CARDINAL et seq . ) . On CARDINAL DATE ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , did not accept the constitutional complaint of ORG ( Transcendental Meditation ) for adjudication , confirming that ORG was entitled to provide information on new religious and ideological communities and \u201c psycho - groups \u201d in compliance with its constitutional obligations , namely to express opinions and submit recommendations and warnings to the public within the limits of the proper execution of the powers granted by LAW ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG ( Deutscher Bundestag ) charged an expert commission to prepare a report on \u201c so - called sects and psycho - cults \u201d . In its final report issued in DATE ORG stated that negative sentiments were typically evoked when the term \u201c sect \u201d was used .
