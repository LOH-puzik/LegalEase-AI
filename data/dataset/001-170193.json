Also he did not have the appropriate equipment for working in the forest .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report further held that PERSON had not been close to the area where the accident had happened , and therefore he could not have been responsible for an act of involuntary manslaughter . Furthermore , the impugned act had lacked one of the elements of an offence , namely guilt . An act which had occurred as a result of unforeseeable circumstances ( caz fortuit ) could not amount to an offence . The suspects had been unable to foresee that event , notably the fact that the tree had changed direction while it was moving , thus killing the victim .", "CARDINAL .

By a report of DATE ORG proposed to close the criminal investigation against PERSON and GPE It held , inter alia , that once FAC , GPE and the first applicant \u2019s husband were in the forest they had started moving trees from a difficult area to a more easily accessible one , using the tractor being operated by ORG Before they had started moving a fourth tree , PERSON had been sent to collect some of their belongings which had been left in a different location . Meanwhile , the first applicant \u2019s husband had attached the tree to the tractor and had signalled ORG to start moving the tree . During the moving operation , the tree had started rolling uncontrollably and had hit the first applicant \u2019s husband on the head , killing him .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report also held that according to ORG \u2019s statement the time which had elapsed between the moment he had checked ( s - a asigurat ) that the first applicant \u2019s husband was at a safe distance from the tree and the moment the victim was hit by the said tree was very short . Once he had realised what had happened he had stopped the tractor immediately and rushed to help the victim . When PERSON had returned with their belongings , ORG had asked him to call the emergency services . As PERSON had not been able to make a phone call in the forest because of poor cellular network , he had decided to rush towards the village in search of a better location for a phone call . Eventually PERSON had reached the village of PERSON and had managed to call the emergency services . At the same time he had met the victim \u2019s brother and had informed him of the accident . Subsequently , PERSON had gone home in order to wait for the police and the ambulance in order to lead them to the location of the accident . Once PERSON had returned to the location of the accident accompanied by the police , he had been advised to leave again in order to avoid a potential conflict with the victim \u2019s family .", "CARDINAL . The report further held that GPE , the witness proposed by the victim \u2019s mother , had stated that he had been at work at the time of the accident and had been informed about the victim \u2019s death by telephone .", "CARDINAL . The report noted that according to the technical expert report the main cause of the accident was the victim \u2019s failure to position himself at a safe distance from the tree and to maintain permanent visual contact with ORG in order to determine whether the moving tree had stopped or had become stuck . Therefore , he had breached the relevant safety and security norms for working in the forest and had not been wearing protective equipment , in particular a helmet . If the victim had been positioned correctly , the accident would not have happened even if the tree had started rolling . Another important cause of the accident was the fact that according to the toxicology report the victim had been working under the influence of alcohol .", "CARDINAL . Relying on the aforementioned considerations and the conclusions of the technical expert , the report concluded that the individuals responsible for causing the accident could not be identified . However , it was clear that the CARDINAL suspects had not been at fault . Moreover , the relevant legislation concerning work safety had not been applicable because those involved in the incident were not employees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor attached to ORG decided to close ( clasat ) the criminal investigation opened against FAC and GPE The prosecutor held on the basis of the available evidence that none of the suspects had been responsible for the victim \u2019s death . The incident had been the result of unforeseeable circumstances given that the tree had been towed with a flexible steel cable whose direction of movement would have been impossible to control , and there was no appropriate equipment for working in the forest . It would have been impossible for the suspects to foresee the event , as the tree had changed direction while it was moving and thus had killed the victim . Moreover , PERSON was not near the location of the accident at the time . Consequently , there was no connection between his conduct and the act of involuntary manslaughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the aforementioned decision was communicated to the victim \u2019s mother at her home address in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant is the first applicant \u2019s brother .", "CARDINAL .

After a police officer and CARDINAL unidentified gendarmes had arrived at the scene of the incident , he had been threatened , caught by the nose , slapped and cursed by CARDINAL of the CARDINAL unidentified gendarmes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Timi\u015foara ORG produced a forensic report concluding that the second applicant had suffered traumatic lesions which could have been sustained on DATE and could have been the result of being hit by or against hard objects . Moreover , the lesions had required DATE of medical care , in the absence of complications .", "CARDINAL .

Moreover , it noted that according to the medical documents produced by FAC on DATE the second applicant had been taken to hospital by ambulance and had suffered , inter alia , an acute closed cranium cerebral trauma and contusions on the nasal pyramid , lower jaw and thorax .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE a prosecutor attached to ORG decided to close the criminal investigation in the case in respect of PERSON At the same time it disjoined part of the case and referred it back to ORG in order to continue the investigation and identify the perpetrators of the alleged offences . The prosecutor noted that even though the victims of the incident had been heard again and they had repeated their earlier statements as well as their request for those against whom they had complained to be punished , they had not asked for additional evidence to be adduced to the case file . Also , CARDINAL witnesses had been heard again in the case , but none of them had provided new information about the events of DATE . None of the said witnesses could have confirmed that PERSON or another person had hurt or threatened the second applicant . CARDINAL of the witnesses had testified that he had seen the second applicant on the ground at the site of the incident and that the latter had told him that PERSON had hit him . However , the aforementioned witness had also stated that at the moment of his conversation with the second applicant he had not seen PERSON in the area and therefore he could not have confirmed the second applicant \u2019s statement .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor also noted that even though the victims of the incident had later declared that they knew the identity of the perpetrators , at the time of the incident and after the police had arrived they had been unable to identify the perpetrators and had stated that they did not know their identity .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor further noted that CARDINAL of the witnesses proposed by CARDINAL of the second applicant \u2019s brothers had not been heard because he had left the country and no substitute had been suggested . Also the applicant \u2019s other brother , who had also been involved in the incident , was not interviewed after he had lodged his complaint against the alleged perpetrators , and there was no evidence that he had been threatened or coerced to remain silent .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor held that even though the occurrence of the incident of DATE had not been contested and had been proven by the available forensic report , it was not possible to establish clearly that PERSON or GPE had committed the alleged offences , as they had not been seen at the site of the incident or in the company of the victim . Given the absence of direct and clear evidence which could have proven PERSON \u2019s or PERSON \u2019s guilt , there is doubt that they committed the alleged offences , which works to their advantage .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant challenged the decision before a hierarchical prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a superior prosecutor attached to ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s challenge and upheld the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against ORG decisions before the domestic courts .

By a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the decisions of the prosecutor \u2019s office . It held that the investigating authorities had heard evidence from the victims , the suspects and the witnesses in the case and had correctly established the facts of the case .", "CARDINAL . To the knowledge of the ORG the investigation against other possible perpetrators of the incident of DATE is still open .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , DATE , and DATE the applicants or their family informed ORG about the abuses that had allegedly been committed against them and against their family by PERSON , GPE and certain local police officers on DATE and after that date . Moreover , they voiced their concern that the investigations initiated into the first applicant \u2019s husband \u2019s death and into the incident of DATE had been suppressed and delayed because of the family relationships between CARDINAL of the suspects and several local police officers . Consequently , they asked ORG for help in punishing those responsible .", "CARDINAL .

Also , the first applicant \u2019s husband had been asked to take part in the logging operation by FAC , and therefore there had been no indication that I.D.D. had incited the victim to commit an offence .
