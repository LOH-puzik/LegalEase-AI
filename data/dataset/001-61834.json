The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG , requesting to be registered on the electoral roll in order to exercise his voting rights in the parliamentary election of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to enrol the applicant . ORG specified that , by virtue of LAW , members of the NORP - Cypriot community could not be registered on the NORP - Cypriot electoral roll . Furthermore , the ORG informed the applicant that the matter was under consideration by the Attorney - General of the Republic and that he would be informed of any developments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG against the decision of ORG . He relied on LAW and submitted that , following the dissolution of ORG , the NORP government had failed to set up CARDINAL electoral lists in order to protect the electoral rights of members of both communities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... The right to vote is directly linked to the communal checks and balances which provide for the compilation of separate electoral lists and for separate elections of the representatives of each community . The ideal of democracy \u2013 CARDINAL person , CARDINAL vote in the person 's place of residence DATE does not provide any grounds for the ORG to assume the power to reform the LAW . Such competence is not vested in us , nor can the judicial authorities claim such power . This would be against the principle of the separation of powers on which the LAW is based ...", "Article CARDINAL is contained in Part IV of the LAW , which governs the matters pertaining to ORG and provides for the compilation of separate electoral lists in which the members of each community are included . The applicant belongs to the NORP community and is one of the small number of NORP residing in the part of the territory of GPE under the control of GPE . The denunciation by the applicant of the NORP invasion and his loyalty to the law do not alter what the LAW provides with respect to the election of the members of the legislative body .", "LAW of ORG ] PERSON makes the right to vote conditional on the provisions of LAW . The applicant admits , as it transpires from his counsel 's address , that the proviso to which the right to vote is subject under LAW , if construed literally , excludes the inclusion in the electoral list of any person other than members of the NORP community in GPE . Nevertheless , he suggested that this reservation must be interpreted in the light of the current situation in GPE , which renders the compilation of an electoral list of the members of the NORP community impossible . Given this fact , it had to be surmised that when ORG enacted LAW it had this situation in mind and the impossibility of compiling an electoral list of the members of the NORP community . Hence , this justified the interpretation of the reservation contained in DATE as referring only to those provisions of LAW which were rendered inactive .", "Adopting the interpretation of LAW proposed by the applicant would amount to it being reworded . The fact that the legislator was apprised of all the facts relating to the situation in GPE and chose to place the right safeguarded by LAW under the reservation of LAW , supports the opposite of what the applicant is suggesting ; it indicates an intention by the legislature to subject the compilation of the electoral list to the statutory provisions of LAW . From the wording of LAW we conclude that the legislature 's intention was to place the right to vote under the reservation of all provisions of LAW . This conclusion refutes the allegation of the illegality of the administrative decision under appeal .", "The second ground on which the applicant 's appeal is based is the law of necessity . The necessity of his inclusion in the electoral list ... is derived from the impossibility of compiling an electoral list of the members of the NORP community . Given this state of affairs , PERSON submitted that the inclusion of the applicant in the electoral list of electors of the NORP community was justified and gave him the right to participate as an elector in the forthcoming parliamentary election . This was justified by the fact that the applicant resided in the areas controlled by GPE where he operates , having the same rights and obligations as every other citizen . ...", "Assessment of the necessity relied on by the applicant and the establishment of measures to deal with it ... is a duty that falls upon the legislature . The competence of the judiciary is limited , provided the matter is submitted to it or arises in a case brought before it , to determining the constitutionality of the law ... It is not for the judiciary to assess the need to fill in gaps in the function of the constitutional statutes nor to establish measures to tackle them , which is basically what the applicant pursues with his application . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
