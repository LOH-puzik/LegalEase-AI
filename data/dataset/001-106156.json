As I was present at the [ hearing ] , I witnessed that myself.\u2019 ... \u2018 Deliberate failure to record his statement.\u2019 ... \u2018 It is not surprising that , because of certain judges , other citizens and I think the judiciary is ORG ... \u2018 it is no wonder that in our country the legal order does not function and that every day crime and violence are burgeoning.\u2019", "This [ court ] finds that the above - mentioned words [ made bold for emphasis ] from the private prosecutor \u2019s appeal are insulting in their content and contain insulting allusions ... questioning the professional qualities of Judge PERSON as well as the judges GPE , GPE and ORG , whose withdrawal the private prosecutor in fact requested in her appeal as [ they were ] , in [ her ] view , obviously biased ...", "In this [ court \u2019s ] view , the appeal of the private prosecutor is insulting and demeaning as a whole , which is particularly exemplified in the above - cited passages from her appeal , where [ she ] displays blatant arrogance towards the judges and judiciary in general . Her belittling attitude and desire to give lessons to everyone is apparent . She seeks to demean the judges , which is particularly exemplified when the private prosecutor dares to say that Judge PERSON was harassing her witnesses ... that the public was appalled by the way in which the judge conducted the proceedings , that the finding of the judge was regrettable but even more biased , that the judge should have known what investment is , that the judge was neither inexperienced nor incompetent when she assessed the behaviour of the private prosecutor towards the accused with bias . Therefore , in this [ court \u2019s ] view , there is no doubt that the private prosecutor in her appeal insults and belittles the court by the above - mentioned incriminations . This is the case especially since the above - mentioned allegations are not necessary for the elucidation of the arguments raised in the appeal , as the incriminations in question also contain insulting allusions concerning the professional qualities of Judge PERSON and other judges of this court , through which the private prosecutor objectively tarnishes the reputation of the court .", "Having regard to the list of incriminations in the private prosecutor \u2019s appeal , by which she insults the judges and singles some [ of them ] out while expressing her opinions as regards the bias and corruption of certain judges and the judiciary as a whole , there is no doubt that this [ court ] was obliged , within the meaning of section CARDINAL ) of LAW , to fine [ her ] .", "The above fine appears adequate given the incriminations in the appeal and their number and severity . The private prosecutor will be able to pay this fine ... even though she refused to indicate the amount of her pension . However , it is evident [ from the case file ] that she owns a flat , so her refusal to indicate the amount of her pension \u2013 which she is otherwise obliged [ to do ] \u2013 only shows her arrogance and demeaning attitude towards certain judges and the court as a whole .", "This [ court ] , however , [ established ] that her pension amounts to HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL , and took [ it ] into account when determining the amount of the fine . The court therefore considers that she will be able to pay the fine of HRK CARDINAL within the DATE time - limit . [ It is to be noted ] that if the above fine is not paid in full or in part within [ that ] time - limit , it will be converted into an appropriate prison sentence on the basis of section CARDINAL of LAW by applying the provisions of LAW , mutatis mutandis . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision , arguing , inter alia , that the remarks made in her appeal of CARDINAL October CARDINAL had been taken out of context and that their aim had not been to insult , but to undermine the lawfulness of the appealed first - instance judgment of CARDINAL DATE . By making those remarks she had been expressing her opinion and had had reason to believe that it was valid . However , she had been fined only because she had dared to doubt the impartiality of Judge PERSON and to complain about judges who were considered to be infallible .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance decision . ORG decision , which was served on the applicant on DATE read , in its relevant part , as follows :", "\u201c The [ ORG ] correctly found that the private prosecutor PERSON , in her appeal lodged against the judgment of ORG of DATE , expressed disrespect for judicial office and thereby insulted the court .", "Namely , the fact is that by the remarks made in the appeal at issue , which are highlighted in the contested decision , the court is being insulted and belittled . [ This is so ] because those incriminating remarks were obviously not necessary for the elucidation of the grounds for the appeal . By their content [ they ] represent demeaning and insulting allusions and expressions , which groundlessly question the professional qualities of judges , insult the court as a whole , show arrogance in respect of judges and the judiciary in general and thereby objectively tarnish the reputation of the court .", "As the court is , on the basis of the mandatory statutory provision of section CARDINAL ) of LAW , obliged to impose a fine when it finds that the conditions set forth in that provision have been met , the imposition of a fine on the private prosecutor \u2013 as a measure to secure [ procedural ] discipline of the parties \u2013 in order to prevent her possible such or similar behaviour in DATE was well - founded .", "Therefore , the private prosecutor \u2019s appeal in which she does not actually deny having made insulting remarks , is unfounded .", "Contrary to the arguments raised in the appeal , the amount of the imposed fine of HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL [ NORP ] kunas , which under section CARDINAL ) of LAW , may be up to HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL , is appropriate to the number , gravity and severity of the insults , the income and the general behaviour of the private prosecutor so far , where regard should be had to the fact ... that the fine was ordered to be paid within DATE . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint under section CARDINAL of LAW against ORG decision .
