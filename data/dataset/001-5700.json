{"ITEMID": "001-5700", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "PORTER v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . She is represented before the Court by Mr T. Christie of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant and her husband , who are both gypsies , purchased a plot of land in DATE and moved to live there in their caravans . Applications made for planning permission for either of their caravans or for a dwelling were refused by ORG ( the Council ) . The site lay within LOC .", "The applicant has been involved in procedures challenging the refusal of planning permission for DATE . In the latest appeal against the refusal of planning permission , ORG held in his decision of DATE inter alia", "\u201c CARDINAL . PPGCARDINAL makes it clear that development not falling within the categories of exceptions against development in LOC is \u201c inappropriate \u201d development and should not be approved except in very special circumstances . Para . CARDINAL of PPGCARDINAL makes it clear that the very special circumstances to justify inappropriate development will not exist unless the harm by reason of the inappropriateness and any other harm is clearly outweighed by other considerations ...", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the above established planning policy background and the representations made , and from my inspection of the appeal property and its surroundings , I consider that the main issue in this case is whether the retention of the mobile home and its associated outbuildings would be inappropriate development in LOC , and if so whether there are any very special circumstances which outweigh the harm caused by such development .", "CARDINAL . Inappropriate development comprises all development except for a limited number of specified exceptions . The proposed retention of a new residential unit and the associated outbuildings does not constitute one of the identified exceptions ...", "CARDINAL . I turn now to whether there are very special circumstances in this case which outweigh the harm caused by such inappropriate development . You indicate ... the fact that the development is unobtrusive in form and ... the gypsy status of the < applicant and her husband>. ...", "CARDINAL . The appeal site is located close to the boundary between LOC and the north - western tip of the developed area of GPE . Given this location , I accept the ORG 's view that it is particularly vulnerable to pressure from the expansion of this adjoining area . As such , the continued openness of the site and that of the tract of land of which it forms part is of considerable importance in ensuring that the adjoining area does not expand and coalesce with the developed area of ORG to the west . Although the area contains a number of existing buildings it remains predominantly rural in character and largely undeveloped . However < the applicant 's > development , by virtue of its design , nature and siting constitutes a cluttered and urban form of development . This I consider ... is both harmful to the rural and open character of the Green Belt and to the visual amenities and landscape of this part of LOC . ...", "CARDINAL . ... With respect to the accommodation needs of < the applicant > , I have taken into account that there are CARDINAL authorised gypsy caravan sites in NORP consisting of a total of CARDINAL pitches having a capacity for accommodating CARDINAL caravans . In DATE , CARDINAL caravans of CARDINAL families were parked on these pitches .", "CARDINAL ... I do not find the fact of < the applicant 's > infirmity or of the suitability of horse - keeping and breeding in the countryside to be very special reasons for allowing the retention of residential use in LOC . There is no convincing reason why the use could not be carried out and secure permanent accommodation found elsewhere on land outside LOC .", "CARDINAL . I have taken into account all other matters raised in the written representations including the support given to < the applicant > locally but there is nothing of sufficient substance to outweigh those considerations which led me to the decision in this case .", "CARDINAL . For the above reasons ... I hereby dismiss the appeal ... \u201d", "The ORG took proceedings to obtain an injunction against the applicant and her husband . On DATE , ORG ordered the applicant to remove the caravans .", "Following the applicant 's appeal , ORG on DATE adjourned the matter pending further argument and with a view to reviewing the matter in the light of LAW DATE entering into force on DATE .", "ORG as amended by ORG DATE ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) consolidated pre - existing planning law . It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development ( ORG v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and GPE [ DATE ] ORG Law CARDINAL ; PERSON v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [ DATE ] ORG ) .", "An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority , which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan , unless material considerations indicate otherwise ( section CARDINALA of LAW ) .", "The DATE Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of ORG in the event of a refusal of permission ( section CARDINAL ) . With immaterial exceptions , the Secretary of ORG must , if either the appellant or the authority so desire , give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of ORG . It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence ( see the PERSON the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . There is a further appeal to ORG on the ground that the Secretary of ORG 's decision was not within the powers conferred by LAW , or that the relevant requirements of LAW were not complied with ( section FAC ) .", "If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission , the local authority may issue an \u201c enforcement notice \u201d if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of ORG on the grounds , inter alia , that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question ( section CARDINAL ) . As with the appeal against refusal of permission , the Secretary of ORG must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector .", "Again there is a further right of appeal \u201c on a point of law \u201d to ORG against a decision of the Secretary of ORG under section CARDINAL ( section CARDINAL ) . Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review . It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG ) . ORG will also grant a remedy if the inspector 's decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact ; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors ; or made for an improper purpose , in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument . However , the court of review can not substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision - making authority .", "Where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice , the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "The purpose of ORG and the operation of the policy to protect them is set out in the national policy document FAC ( DATE ) .", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Government attaches great importance to GPE , which have been an essential element of planning policy for DATE . ...", "CARDINAL . The fundamental aim of LOC policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open ; the most important attribute of ORG is their openness . Green Belts can shape patterns of urban development at sub - regional and regional scale , and help to ensure that development occurs in locations allocated in development plans . They help to protect the countryside , be it in agricultural , forestry or other use . They can assist in moving towards more sustainable patterns of urban development .", "CARDINAL . There are CARDINAL purposes in GPE :", "- to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built - up areas ;", "- to prevent neighbouring towns from merging into one another ;", "- to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment ;", "- to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns ; and", "- to assist in urban regeneration by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land . ...", "CARDINAL . NORP The essential characteristic of GPE is their permanence . Their protection must be maintained as far as can be seen ahead . ...", "CARDINAL . The general policies controlling development in the countryside apply with equal force in Green Belts but there is , in addition , a general presumption against inappropriate development within them . Such development should not be approved , except in very special circumstances . ...", "CARDINAL . Inappropriate development is , by definition , harmful to LOC . It is for the applicant to show why permission should be granted . Very special circumstances to justify inappropriate development will not exist unless the harm by reason of inappropriateness , and any other harm , is clearly outweighed by other considerations . In view of the presumption against inappropriate development , the Secretary of ORG will attach substantial weight to the harm to the Green Belt when considering any planning application or appeal concerning such development . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
