The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder and placed in pre - trial detention pursuant to an order of ORG of LOC ( \u201c the GPE ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial on several occasions . On the latter date it ordered that he remain in detention until DATE . It referred to the seriousness of the charges against him and the absence of any grounds to change that particular preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant as charged and he was sentenced to imprisonment . It also ordered that he remain in detention until his conviction became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the applicant \u2019s conviction and sent his case to the first - instance court for fresh examination . Its decision stated that the preventive measure applied to him \u201c should remain unchanged \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In an interlocutory hearing on DATE ORG examined a request by the applicant for release pending trial , subject to him either giving an undertaking not to leave a specified place or the application of a different preventive measure . He argued , in particular , that ORG brief indication in its decision of DATE that the preventive measure applied to him should remain unchanged could not serve as a sufficient legal basis for his continued detention . In this connection , ORG noted that ORG decision , in so far as it had concerned the preventive measure , had been lawful as it had been taken in accordance with the relevant provisions of national law . It further did not consider it possible to release the applicant pending trial on account of the seriousness of charges against him and the fact that he was a foreign national and did not reside within the territory of GPE , with the result that he might abscond if at liberty or put pressure on witnesses . The court thus ordered that his detention be extended until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE on appeal . It stated that ORG , in convicting the applicant on DATE , had indicated that he should remain in detention until that judgment became final . It further noted that when quashing the conviction , it itself had stated that the preventive measure applied to the applicant should remain unchanged , and that then , in accordance with LAW of LAW , ORG had extended the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE . It thus concluded that the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was lawful , wellfounded and based on a court order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG further extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . He requested his release , stating that he had been in custody for a long time and that his health had deteriorated . The court held that there were no grounds to change the preventive measure applied to him . It referred to the seriousness of the charges against him and the fact that he was a foreign national and did not reside within the territory of GPE , with the result that he might abscond or influence witnesses if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant remain in detention until DATE . He asked the court to change the preventive measure , referring to the poor state of his health and the fact that he had already been kept in detention for a long time . He further argued that he would not abscond , given that his family lived in ORG and owned property nearby . The court stated that because the applicant had been charged with a particularly serious offence , had pleaded not guilty , was a foreign national and was not registered within the territory of GPE , he might seek to evade justice . It also stated that the extension of his detention was necessary , in view of the fact that an expert examination in his case was being carried out in GPE at the time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG further extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . He asked to be released , arguing that he had a child and family in LOC as well as property nearby where he could be registered .

On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release , subject to him giving an undertaking not to leave a specified place . The court noted that he had been kept in detention for a long time , and that his wife and child lived in GPE , where the latter went to school . It also took into account the fact that they were NORP nationals , and that there was therefore a possibility , and a place , for the applicant to live in the LOC pending trial . The court further noted that the results of the expert examination carried out in GPE had since been received . It also referred to the fact that the applicant had no previous criminal record , had positive references from his place of residence and place of work and needed medical treatment as his health had deteriorated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant . In the operative part of its judgment it stated that he had a right to \u201c rehabilitation \u201d ( \u0440\u0435\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f ) and that it was open to him to claim compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the acquittal on appeal .", "CARDINAL . After his acquittal the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the authorities in LOC under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure and LAW . He claimed MONEY ( RUB ) for the pecuniary damage resulting from his unlawful prosecution and detention , and RUB CARDINAL for costs and expenses .

Furthermore , he could not work and his health had deteriorated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly allowed the applicant \u2019s claim for non - pecuniary damage and awarded him RUB CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( MONEY ) .

On this basis the court found that he had been unlawfully prosecuted , unlawfully detained from DATE to DATE and , subsequently , unlawfully subjected to an undertaking not to leave a specified place . It further stated that , where a person \u2019s right to rehabilitation had been recognised , the existence of non - pecuniary damage was presumed and it was only the amount to be awarded that had to be established . For these purposes the court took into account the suffering caused to the applicant and the fact that his health had deteriorated . It relied on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW in this regard .", "CARDINAL .
