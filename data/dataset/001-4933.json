THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and detained in PERSON , GPE .", "He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in at ORG , GPE , GPE .", "A.", "On DATE , at ORG , the applicant was convicted of being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition or restriction on the importation of a Class A drug namely QUANTITY of cocaine . The offence was contrary to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . The applicant 's co - accused PERSON ( \u201c Ndandaye \u201d ) , also known as PERSON , pleaded guilty to the same charge and was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "Fact of the case against the applicant", "On DATE the applicant and ORG arrived at FAC airport on a flight from GPE via GPE . NORP customs officers were looking out for them having been notified by NORP customs officers that they had found cocaine in ORG 's bag . ORG was stopped , questioned , but allowed to leave the customs hall . He was arrested getting into a taxi outside the terminal . His brown hold - all type bag contained QUANTITY of cocaine . The applicant was arrested by customs officers after he had collected his own luggage . The applicant was searched and he was interviewed CARDINAL times .", "The first interview took place on DATE . The applicant was cautioned as follows :", "\u201c You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court . Anything you do say may be given in evidence . \u201d", "The interview ended after TIME because the applicant requested legal advice . The following day he was interviewed for TIME and after the caution read the following statement :", "\u201c I < A.J.D. > wish to make the following statement . I was born on DATE and live at CARDINAL PERSON , PERSON CARDINALHU . I travelled from GPE to GPE on a ORG flight on DATE through to DATE .", "I spent a period of time in GPE before travelling to GPE . I left GPE on a ORG flight on DATE returning via GPE to GPE on DATE . I travelled to and from GPE using my own genuine passport and the personal details contained therein are true and accurate .", "I have no knowledge of the importation of crack cocaine by any other person and have not knowingly been involved in such importation myself . My own knowledge on this matter is as a result of information given to me in private consultation with my solicitor . I am not willing to make any further comment at this time . \u201d", "The interviewing officers then asked the applicant a number of questions to which he replied \u201c no comment \u201d . The applicant was interviewed for a third time DATE for TIME and gave \u201c no comment \u201d answers .", "The prosecution alleged that ORG was a courier and that the applicant was a minder . In this respect it was alleged the offence was a joint enterprise . The prosecution adduced evidence from Miss PERSON , a travel agent , that on DATE the applicant telephoned her to book a seat on a flight to GPE and she told him that it would cost \u00a3 MONEY . Shortly after this the applicant arrived at the shop and gave her \u00a3 CARDINAL . The applicant stated he wanted to make a booking for a Mr. PERSON ( ORG ) . She issued extra return tickets in the name of Mr. PERSON . They did not in fact return on this flight but on a ORG flight .", "The applicant gave evidence that he had been introduced to a person called PERSON ( ie ORG ) through a friend and that he himself was in the jewellery and car business . The purpose of the visit to GPE was to buy gold from someone PERSON knew who sold it cheaply . The applicant did not pay for ORG 's ticket ; he was given \u00a3 MONEY by ORG for that . ORG told him that he did not need to take cash with him as payment could be made through his GPE bank account . They went to GPE but no real deal was struck because the friend was not willing to sell gold except for cash . They went on to GPE and ORG asked the applicant to stay for DATE . ORG then presented the applicant with a new return ticket to fly back with ORG DATE . The first time that the applicant had seen ORG carrying the brown holdall was in GPE . The scales found in the applicant 's possession were for weighing gold and he had borrowed them as his own scales were not of the right type .", "The applicant answered all questions asked of him at trial . He said the reason that he had failed to account for certain details in interview was that he was advised by his lawyer to make a statement and then to answer \u201c no comment \u201d . The applicant sought to give evidence as to what advice he had received from his solicitor and the instructions he had given . However the judge ruled that such evidence was inadmissible on the grounds of hearsay and/or relevance .", "The trial judge 's summing up", "The judge reminded the jury of the terms of the caution , the fact that the appellant was interviewed CARDINAL times , the topics which were raised in interview , the \u201c no comment \u201d answers and the fact that he made a short statement in writing . The judge stated :", "\u201c The law is that you may draw inferences as you think proper from a failure to mention facts at the time . You do not have to hold it against him . It is for you to decide whether it is proper to do so . Failure to mention such facts at that time can not on its own prove guilt . But , depending on the circumstances , you may hold that failure against him when deciding if he is guilty , that is take it into account as some additional support in the prosecution case . It is for you to decide whether it is fair to do so .", "The < applicant > says that he was advised to make the statement and then to answer \u201c no comment \u201d to all the questions . Advice had come from the legal representative or solicitor who was present with him . You will ask yourselves , members of the jury , why , if the answers which would have been given and have been given in evidence would have pointed to the innocence of the < applicant > , he would have been advised not to answer questions in interview , or why he chose not to . A solicitor 's advice not to answer questions does not prevent you from drawing such inferences as I have already directed that you may draw . It is a matter entirely for you . \u201d", "On DATE the jury convicted the applicant by a unanimous verdict .", "The appeal", "Originally the applicant applied for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence on personally drafted grounds . His application was refused by a single judge . His renewed application to the full ORG was adjourned on DATE . The adjourned hearing took place with the assistance of Counsel on DATE .", "The applicant 's first ground of appeal was that as the inference of post interview fabrication by the applicant was in issue , evidence of what was said to the solicitor pre interview was potentially probative in rebuttal of such inference and thus relevant and admissible . ORG agreed stating ' the trial judge should not have indicated an unwillingness to allow the evidence to be adduced ' . ORG therefore agreed in the interests of justice to allow the evidence to be adduced .", "The applicant , giving evidence , told ORG that the discussion with his solicitor lasted TIME . He told the solicitor the whole story in accordance with what he later said at trial . The solicitor told him that he did not see anything which connected him with the crime . The solicitor advised the applicant to make a basic statement and to offer \u201c no comment \u201d . He did not think the applicant would ever be charged .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG considered it crucial that the solicitor was not called by the applicant to give evidence at the appeal . It found that it was highly unlikely that the solicitor would have given the applicant the advice he claimed . It concluded that although the judge fell into error in excluding the evidence , having heard the evidence it was clear that it would not have materially advanced the defence case at trial . The applicant had not therefore been unduly prejudiced by its exclusion . As regards the applicant 's second ground of appeal which concerned the manner in which the trial judge dealt with the \u201c no comment \u201d answers in interview in his summing up , ORG accepted that there was some shortcoming in the summing up in that the judge did not direct the jury that they had to be satisfied that the prosecution had established a case to answer before they could draw an adverse inference from the applicant 's failure to answer questions at interview . It was not necessary to do so but desirable . It was not enough to flaw the conviction .", "On DATE , ORG refused leave to ORG . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Section CARDINAL and LAW of ORG LAW DATE provide so far as is relevant :", "\u201c DATE .
