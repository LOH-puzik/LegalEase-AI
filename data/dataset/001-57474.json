THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Questions of procedure rejected;Violation of Art. 5-3;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON , who were born in DATE and DATE respectively , reside in the GPE . In DATE and DATE , after being forcibly drafted as conscript soldiers in ORG , they each refused , on account of their beliefs as conscientious objectors , to obey specific orders deriving from their obligation to perform military service . They were placed in detention by the competent military officers for suspected offences against LAW ( Wetboek van Militair Strafrecht ) . They were kept in custody and referred for trial before a military court .", "CARDINAL . Exemption may be obtained from compulsory military service on the ground of conscientious objection , both before and after active military service has begun . The procedure for requesting such exemption from the Minister of Defence is laid down in ORG ( Wet Gewetensbezwaren Militaire ORG ) and a Ministerial Decree of DATE .", "In the present case , neither applicant ever submitted a request to the Minister of Defence to be granted the status of conscientious objector ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Criminal procedure for the military land and air forces , including in particular the matter of arrest and detention on remand , is governed by the ORG and Air Force Code of Procedure ( Rechtspleging bij de Land - en Luchtmacht - \" LAW \" ) , as last amended on DATE . Offences under military criminal law , which applies equally to conscript servicemen such as the applicants and to volunteers , are tried at first instance before a Military Court ( PERSON ) . There may be an appeal to ORG ( PERSON ) and ultimately a ( cassation ) appeal on points of law to ORG ( PERSON ) of the GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Every officer and non - commissioned officer is empowered to arrest military personnel of lower rank suspected of a serious offence provided the circumstances require immediate deprivation of liberty ( LAW ) . The resultant detention is not to exceed TIME ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "The commanding officer may order a suspected serviceman to be placed or kept in custody on remand if ( a ) there is a serious risk of absconding or ( b ) there are important reasons of public safety requiring immediate deprivation of liberty or ( c ) this is necessary in connection with the maintenance of military discipline among other servicemen ( DATE paragraph ) . Such a detention order may be made against a serviceman suspected of any offence set out in LAW or any offence in respect of which detention on remand is permitted under LAW , with the exception of those offences of which ORG takes no cognisance ( DATE paragraph ) . An order may not be issued if the suspect is unlikely to be penalised by unconditional imprisonment or by any other measure restricting his freedom , or is likely to be given a sentence of shorter duration than that of the detention on remand ( ibid . ) . Detention must be terminated once the grounds for it cease to exist ( LAW paragraph ) . All cases of detention exceeding DATE shall be reported by the commanding officer to the commanding general ( LAW paragraph ) .", "Where detention has lasted DATE , the suspected serviceman may petition the competent ORG to fix a term ( liable to extension ) within which the commanding general must either decide whether the case is to be referred to a ORG or else terminate the detention . ORG has to rule on the petition without delay , after hearing the authority empowered to refer the case , the auditeur - militair ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and the suspected serviceman , who may have the assistance of an adviser ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG If , after receiving the advice of the auditeur - militair and , \" if possible \" ( \" zo mogelijk \" ) , after the suspected serviceman has been heard , the commanding general or a senior officer ( hoofd officier ) designated by him to act on his behalf considers that the case should be tried by ORG , the serviceman shall be referred for trial before that ORG ( LAW ) . On the other hand , the commanding general or the designated officer may in appropriate circumstances leave the case to be dealt with as a disciplinary matter ( LAW Regulation No . CARDINAL of ORG explained the effect of these provisions in the following terms ( translation from NORP ) :", "\" In military penal procedure , as distinct from civilian procedure , the decision to prosecute in a case is not taken separately by the prosecuting authority , the auditeur - militair , but by a military authority . That authority is the commanding general or the senior officer he has appointed to act on his behalf , i.e. the referring officer ... Thus , the auditeur - militair is merely an advisory body at this stage , although the obtaining of his advice and the giving of that advice by him are mandatory . \"", "Any decision to refer for trial must be in writing and state whether the suspected serviceman is to be released or kept in custody ; the grounds for detention set out in the second and fourth paragraphs of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) apply pari passu ( Article CARDINAL ) . If , against the advice of the auditeur - militair , the commanding general or designated senior officer chooses not to refer a suspected serviceman for trial , the auditeur - militair may take the matter to ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) . No appeal is provided for in the contrary case .", "According to the Government , it has now become standard procedure to apply the above provisions of LAW in the following manner . Where detention on remand has been ordered , the suspected serviceman is always heard by the auditeur - militair and any referral to ORG takes place shortly thereafter , on DATE after the arrest . In view of the requirements of LAW the auditeur - militair \u2019s assessment of the circumstances and his advice to the commanding general or designated senior officer cover not only referral for trial but also the question whether the conditions for detention on remand set out in LAW fulfilled . Thus , the standard written form used by the auditeur - militair for the purposes of transmitting his advice to the referring officer contains , inter alia , a paragraph as to whether the suspect should \" be released or be placed or kept in custody \" . Practice has evolved to the point where the advice of the auditeur - militair is invariably followed and generally regarded as binding .", "CARDINAL . Detention maintained or ordered in the decision referring the serviceman for trial may not exceed DATE unless extended , by terms of DATE , by ORG at the request of the auditeur - militair ( DATE ) . Every accused detained by virtue of the referral decision must be heard by the officier - commissaris ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as speedily as possible and in any event within DATE of referral ; in this connection , the accused may be assisted by an adviser ( Article CARDINAL , first paragraph ) . Before extending detention , ORG must give the accused or his adviser the opportunity to submit argument ( Article CARDINAL , second paragraph ) .", "As soon as the grounds for the detention cease to exist , release must be ordered ( LAW , first paragraph ) . In the period between referral and commencement of the trial , power to order release is exercisable by the auditeur - militair , or by ORG at the request of either the officier - commissaris or the detained serviceman himself ( Article CARDINAL , second paragraph ) . ORG , in deciding on such requests , will hear the auditeur - militair and also the detained serviceman or his adviser where the serviceman is requesting release for the first time ( DATE paragraph ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG If the accused is in custody at the first hearing , ORG will decide , after being addressed by the auditeur - militair , whether or not the nature and circumstances of the case require his continued detention during the trial ( LAW . The ORG may direct the accused \u2019s release from detention on remand at any later stage in the proceedings , either of its own motion or at the request of the auditeur - militair or the accused himself ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG A serviceman in custody may request release or suspension of his detention under LAW in proceedings before ORG pending the decision on his appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG The auditeur - militair has the function of prosecuting authority before ORG ( Article CARDINAL , first paragraph ) . No serving member of ORG may appear as auditeur - militair or substitute auditeur - militair ( LAW paragraph ) . The auditeur - militair and his substitute may be replaced by an acting auditeur - militair ( plaatsvervanger - LAW paragraph ) who may be a military officer , but such replacement was said by the Government to occur only in exceptional circumstances . Auditeurs - militair ( including substitutes and acting ones ) are appointed , and dismissed , by the Crown on a joint proposal from the Ministers of Justice and Defence ; they must possess a law degree ( LAW paragraphs ) . Under the terms of LAW , second paragraph , of LAW , they are obliged to comply with instructions given to them in their official capacity by the Minister of ORG . However , according to the Government , this latter provision serves as no more than the legal authority for issuing general guidelines on prosecution policy and , at least in DATE , no Minister of ORG has acted or interfered in a concrete case on the basis of LAW .", "The auditeur - militair is bound by his oath to act honestly and impartially ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . He must attend the hearings of ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) but he does not take part in the ORG \u2019s deliberations . He is under a general duty to assist ORG , as well as the commanding general , with reports , observations and advice in relation to military justice when required to do so ( Article CARDINAL ) . He is not under the supervision of ORG or ORG in the discharge of his duties , save that ORG has the power to reprimand him should he fail strictly to observe statutory time - limits ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Attached to each Military Court is CARDINAL officier - commissaris who is in charge of the preliminary investigation of cases ( DATE ) . An officier - commissaris is an officer or former officer of ORG with the rank of captain or higher and is appointed for a fixed term of DATE by the commanding general ( ibid . ) . While he may at the same time be a member of ORG , this is not usually the case . His task of preliminary investigation involves gathering the facts and hearing witnesses and the accused when necessary ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE ) . A hearing by the officier - commissaris has the same force as a hearing by ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) . During his enquiries , he is under a duty to apply himself equally to discovering the accused \u2019s innocence and to obtaining proof or admission of guilt ( Article CARDINAL ) . Like the auditeur - militair , he is bound by his oath to act honestly and impartially ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Military Court sits with a president and CARDINAL military members ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "The latter are military officers appointed by the commanding general ; during their term of office , which is for DATE at least , they may not be dismissed ; they must be CARDINAL of age and be commissioned officers ( LAW . In practice , the rank most commonly possessed is that of captain or major . There is no requirement that the military members be legally qualified . According to the Government , although they retain the status of military officers , they are independent in their capacity as judges and no order can be given to them by anyone . Like the president , the military members are bound by oath to act honestly and impartially ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "The president is a civilian who must be the holder of a university law degree ; he is appointed for life by the ORG on the joint recommendation of ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "The deliberations of ORG are secret and its members are not allowed to make public their personal opinions or those of their colleagues ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON was arrested on DATE on a charge of having failed to register in due time as a conscript serviceman ( LAW ) . He was transferred to military barracks where he refused to submit to a medical examination . He was then further accused of persistent insubordination ( LAW ) . On DATE , the commanding officer confirmed the detention , the ground relied on being the need to maintain discipline amongst other servicemen ( LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "On DATE , he was brought before the auditeur - militair . On DATE , in accordance with the advice of the auditeur - militair , the designated senior officer referred the applicant for trial before ORG , while deciding that he should be kept in custody on the same ground as before ( Articles CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , second paragraph , of LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant was heard by the officier - commissaris ( Article CARDINAL , first paragraph , of LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "On DATE , ORG examined a request made by the applicant on DATE for release from custody ( LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . At this hearing , the applicant submitted , inter alia , that the requirements of LAW ( LAW ) of the LAW had not been complied with . ORG held that the lapse of time between the applicant \u2019s arrest and his appearance before the officier - commissaris , a judicial officer , was \" considerable \" but nonetheless \" acceptable \" , having regard both to the fact that this period comprised a DATE and to the geographical distance between the various intervening authorities . Accordingly , considering that the grounds for detention were still prevailing , the ORG dismissed his request .", "Subsequently , his detention was regularly prolonged by ORG .", "CARDINAL .

However , on DATE , it acceded with immediate effect to the second part subject to a number of conditions , inter alia , that he accepted - which he did - to perform substitute civilian service over a minimum period of DATE and to submit to a medical examination . Criminal proceedings were likewise suspended by the ORG under the same conditions .", "ORG subsequently sentenced Mr. PERSON to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment , the time spent in custody on remand , which likewise totalled DATE , to be deducted therefrom .", "CARDINAL .
