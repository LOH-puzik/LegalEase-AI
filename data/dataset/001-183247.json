NORP In DATE the applicant asked ORG to prepare PERSON \u2019s ownership documents in respect of the plot of land . She stated that she had already delivered to ORG the receipt confirming that PERSON had paid for the land .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG replied to the applicant , saying that she had delivered only a copy of the payment notice , which had not been confirmed by the bank , and that the document confirming the payment for the land would be issued when she delivered the original receipt . The applicant was further informed that the plot of land in question belonged to the ORG , and that if she wanted to purchase the plot of land which she had been using then she had to provide the authorities with a plan of the land and a document confirming the legal registration of the buildings on that land .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant wrote a letter to ORG and stated that she had not asked to be issued with a document confirming the payment for the land ; she had asked the authorities to issue her with the documents confirming PERSON \u2019s ownership of the land . The applicant also wrote that she was not willing to purchase the land because her grandmother had already purchased it . ORG replied that PERSON had not concluded the purchase agreement in respect of the plot of land of QUANTITY , and the only document that ORG could issue was the document for the notary confirming that PERSON had paid for the land . After the notary issued the document of inheritance in respect of the payments and the buildings on the land , the land purchase agreement could be concluded with the applicant , and the process of privatising the land , started by PERSON , could be finished .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant started court proceedings and asked ORG to establish as a legal fact that PERSON had owned a house , a storehouse with buildings around a courtyard , and a plot of land in GPE measuring CARDINAL ares ( equivalent to QUANTITY ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG established that on DATE PERSON had asked the national authorities to give her permission to buy the plot of land of QUANTITY .

The court also observed that on DATE PERSON had signed a purchase agreement in respect of the plot of land of QUANTITY . The court held that , in accordance with the provisions of domestic law , it was entitled to establish legal facts only when applicants could not obtain documents confirming such facts in any other manner . The court held that a representative of ORG had confirmed that when the applicant provided all the necessary documents regarding the payments for the land , the plot of land would be measured and documents relating to it would be drawn up , and then it would be registered and the ownership documents would be issued . The court concluded that when the applicant provided the authorities with the receipts of the payments PERSON had made , the obstacles to her receiving the ownership documents would be removed .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal , but on DATE ORG upheld the decision of the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s representative asked ORG to issue her with the ownership documents in respect of PERSON \u2019s land . She referred to the decision of ORG of DATE , where it had been established that the applicant would receive documents confirming PERSON \u2019s ownership of the plot of land of CARDINAL hectares when she presented the authorities with the original receipts ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant \u2019s representative also stated that the notary would not issue her with the inheritance document with regard to the RUR CARDINAL paid , because the notary could only issue inheritance documents with regard to deposits in banks . In DATE ORG reiterated that the applicant had to provide the authorities with an original receipt for the payments PERSON had made . It further stated that the applicant had not submitted a request to purchase the plot of land in question , registration documents for the buildings situated on the land , a copy of her identity document , or a plan of the plot . If a plan of the plot had not been provided because the plot of land had not been measured and the documents relating to the plot had not been drawn up , the person asking to purchase the land had to be informed about the necessity to prepare the territorial planning document and the plan of the plot . ORG stated that it had never been obliged by the domestic courts to issue the applicant with the documents confirming PERSON \u2019s property rights to the land .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant wrote a letter to ORG . She received a response in DATE , where it was indicated that the document of inheritance could only be issued with regard to property and property rights , and it could not be issued with regard to the money the deceased had paid . ORG invited the applicant to address ORG with regard to the privatisation of the land .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s complaint regarding the plot of land . It stated that the house , the garage , the storehouse and the buildings around a courtyard had been registered in ORG in DATE . It was indicated that these buildings had been used by PERSON However , the rights to the property in question had not been registered . ORG further stated that there was a document confirming that PERSON had paid RUR CARDINAL for the preparation of documents , but there was no evidence that she had paid ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the land . ORG also explained what the valid procedure for acquiring ownership rights over land had been in DATE . A person had to ask to purchase a plot of land and provide a document confirming the grounds on which he or she had been using that plot and a plan of the plot . The relevant land service then had to estimate the price of the land and prepare a draft purchase agreement , and the person had to be presented with that agreement . The person then had to confirm that he or she agreed with the price and other conditions set out in the purchase agreement , by signing it . After that , the person had to pay the price indicated in the draft purchase agreement and come and sign the agreement , presenting the authorities with a receipt confirming payment . The purchase agreement had to be approved by a notary and registered with the municipal ( regional ) land service within DATE . It was only possible to inherit such land after the purchase agreement had been confirmed by the notary . The purchase agreement could be signed and registered at the same time . ORG thus decided that the purchase agreement which PERSON had signed was merely a draft agreement . Because the purchase agreement regarding the QUANTITY of land had not been concluded , the privatisation documents regarding that plot had to be prepared in accordance with the legal acts in force at the time . ORG stated that because the applicant had inherited PERSON \u2019s buildings , she could , but was not obliged to , buy the plot of land in question under and around the buildings . The price of the land would be calculated in accordance with the prices valid at the material time , and the amount which PERSON had paid could be deducted from the total price of the land .", "CARDINAL . The applicant started court proceedings , asking ORG to : annul the decisions of the national authorities not to issue her with a document confirming her grandmother \u2019s property rights in respect of the plot of land of QUANTITY ; oblige the national authorities to issue her with that document within DATE ; and award her CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL \u2013 approximately CARDINAL,CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) ) in respect of pecuniary damage , and LAW in respect of non - pecuniary damage . The applicant claimed that the domestic authorities were refusing to issue her with the document confirming her property rights in respect of the plot of land of QUANTITY , and that they were stating that PERSON had not paid for the land . The applicant also claimed that the national authorities were asking her to pay LAW for the land , when the land had already been paid for .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . The court held that PERSON had submitted a request to buy the plot of land of QUANTITY . After that , the national authorities had issued her with a document specifying that the price of the land was ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and she had to pay an additional RUR CARDINAL for the preparation and official registration of the relevant documents . The court also held that the draft purchase agreement had been prepared , but permission to purchase the land , which was obligatory under domestic law , had never been issued . It also observed that the purchase agreement had to be approved by a notary and registered in the relevant register , and this had not been done . The court therefore concluded that , although the procedure to purchase the plot of land of CARDINAL ha had been started , the national authorities had not expressed their willingness to sell the land , and thus the purchase agreement had not been concluded . As ORG had not acted unlawfully , compensation in respect of pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage could not be awarded to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal , and on DATE ORG upheld the decision of the first - instance court . The court reiterated what the privatisation procedure in force in DATE had been ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court observed that , although the land purchase agreement between PERSON and the national authorities had not been marked as a draft agreement , it was actually no more than that . The mere fact that the applicant \u2019s grandmother had signed and paid for the land only represented her willingness to conclude the agreement , and did not prove that the land purchase agreement had actually been concluded . The draft had been prepared on DATE , and this draft also contained additional information from DATE confirming that PERSON had paid ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the land . This information had been included in the draft agreement after it had been prepared . The court held that that information had to be assessed as proof that , after PERSON had paid for the land , she had presented the authorities with the receipt which had been included in the draft . The fact that the agreement was merely a draft was supported by the circumstance that it had not met the requirements of domestic law that purchase agreements had to be approved by a notary and registered by the municipal ( regional ) land service . Moreover , certain lines in the draft had not been filled in . Lastly , DATE and DATE PERSON had not asked the authorities to conclude a purchase agreement based on the provisions of the draft purchase agreement which she had signed , thus it could not be concluded that the purchase of the land had not been concluded due to unlawful actions of the authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the notary issued the applicant with a document of inheritance regarding PERSON \u2019s house , the buildings around the courtyard , the garage and the storehouse .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asked ORG to reopen the proceedings , and on DATE it rejected her application . The court held that reopening proceedings was only possible in the event that a gross violation of the provisions of domestic law had been made . The court observed that no such violation had been made , and thus the applicant \u2019s application was rejected as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG sent a document to the notary confirming that PERSON had paid ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for QUANTITY of land on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a civil claim , asking to be awarded ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of pecuniary damage and EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of non - pecuniary damage for illegal actions committed by the domestic courts in their refusing to establish as a legal fact that PERSON had owned some buildings and QUANTITY of land . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim because she had not provided any evidence about unlawful actions of the domestic courts , nor had she justified the amount of damages claimed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an appeal on points of law by the applicant was rejected because it had been submitted by email and she had not proved her legal qualifications , and on DATE that appeal was rejected because it had not been submitted by a lawyer and had other procedural shortcomings . Lastly , on DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as not raising important legal issues .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG approved the list of candidates who were to receive plots of land . The applicant was included on that list .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was asked to pay LTL MONEY ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) for the plot of land of QUANTITY to be measured and for documents relating to it to be drawn up . The applicant paid the money on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG informed the applicant that in DATE she had signed the agreement regarding the payment which was necessary in order for a plot of land to be measured and for documents relating to it to be drawn up . ORG also stated that after the applicant had paid the money , she would have to address relevant institutions to make cadastral measurements . Moreover , the applicant had to provide the authorities with a document of inheritance issued by the notary , proving that PERSON had paid for the plot of land of QUANTITY . A purchase agreement would then be prepared , deducting the money which PERSON had paid from the final price of the land . The remaining amount to be paid by the applicant would be determined in accordance with the rules set by the Government .", "CARDINAL . The applicant started administrative proceedings against the national authorities for ORG CARDINAL in respect of non - pecuniary damage and for recognition of her right to compensation for pecuniary damage . She complained that , although during the proceedings to establish a legal fact , officials had claimed that she would be issued with the property documents when she provided the original receipts , they had kept refusing her requests . The applicant also claimed that the national authorities were falsely stating that her grandmother had not paid for the land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG established that PERSON had paid ORG CARDINAL for the plot of land of CARDINAL hectares and RUR CARDINAL for redemarcation of the land . The court also held that it had already been established in the other proceedings that the mere fact that the money had been paid did not constitute sufficient grounds to establish that PERSON and the national authorities had concluded the land purchase agreement . The court observed that , even though the officials\u2019 statements had been irresponsible during the proceedings to establish a legal fact ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , there was no evidence confirming that the land purchase procedure had not been finalised as a result of unlawful actions by the national authorities . Consequently , the examination of the part of the applicant \u2019s claim concerning the acknowledgement of her right to compensation for pecuniary damage was terminated , and the other part of the application was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal , and on DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant started administrative proceedings against the national authorities for ORG CARDINAL in respect of pecuniary damage . The applicant claimed that , although her grandmother had paid for the plot of land of QUANTITY , the authorities were requiring her to purchase the same land again and ordering her to pay ORG CARDINAL for a plan of the land . Although the applicant had paid the money , she thought that such a requirement was unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . The court held that it had already been established that PERSON had not completed the purchase agreement , thus ORG could not issue the applicant with the land ownership documents . The purchase documents had to be prepared in accordance with the domestic law applicable at the present time . The court observed that the purchase of plots of land was regulated by the rules approved by ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . ORG was not obliged to pay for the plans of land reform projects prepared in order to transfer land into private ownership . There were no exceptions to this rule . It was also impossible to deduct from the price of the land the payments of ORG CARDINAL and RUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL which PERSON had made for the preparation of documents and redemarcation of the land in DATE . These payments had not resulted in any legal consequences , because the purchase agreement had not been concluded . Documents relating to the plot of land in question had just been drawn up as part of the land reform project , and the applicant had to pay ORG CARDINAL for the measurements . The applicant was indicating that this specific amount was pecuniary damage . However , she had failed to prove the unlawful actions of the authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court held that the amount of ORG CARDINAL could only be returned to the applicant if she refused to purchase or rent the land indicated in the land reform project . The applicant had agreed in writing to pay the money , and she had not refused to purchase or rent the land . The applicant also claimed that PERSON had already paid for the preparation of documents in DATE . The court referred to the domestic legislation and observed that if a person was an owner of a building sited on ORG land , and the person had paid for the land but the purchase agreement had not been concluded , the payments made could be deducted from the final price of the land if a right to deduct these payments was also transferred together with a property right to the buildings ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . If a person had acquired property rights to a building situated on State land before DATE , and a person had paid for the land but the purchase agreement had not been concluded , the payments made could be deducted from the final price of the land if such a right was transferred to a buyer by a document approved by the notary . The applicant thus had to follow these rules .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL CARDINAL of the Law on Land provides that if a building that is transferred into private ownership is sited on a plot of State land for which a person has paid , but where the purchase agreement in respect of that land has not been concluded , such a person acquires a right to purchase the land necessary to use the buildings . The person transferring an ownership right to a building can also transfer the right to deduct payments for the land that have already been made .", "CARDINAL . Government Resolution No .

The LAW also provided that the municipal ( regional ) land service had to prepare a legal document determining the price of the land and a draft purchase agreement within DATE of receiving a person \u2019s request .

These actions had to be performed before the signing of the purchase agreement . The period between the issuing of the decree and the signing of the land purchase agreement could not be longer than DATE ( Point CARDINAL ) . The Order also provided that when a buyer received the notice from the authorities , he or she had to pay for the land before signing the land purchase agreement and come to the authorities to sign the purchase agreement , bringing a document confirming the payment . In the absence of important reasons , if a person had not paid the money or had not come to sign the purchase agreement , the land purchase agreement was not concluded .
