On DATE the District Commissioner of PERSON ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the Commissioner \u201d ) appointed PERSON as M. \u2019s legal trustee .

They claimed that upon PERSON \u2019s death this claim had passed to them as PERSON \u2019s heirs .", "On DATE the ORG found in favour of the respondent and rejected the ORG claim , finding no ground for imposing strict liability , nor any basis for finding negligence since the Commissioner had had no reason to believe that ORG was unfit to be a custodian when he was appointed .", "According to the summary of facts contained in ORG judgment , the plaintiffs were granted permission to carry out a private division of PERSON \u2019s estate on DATE and completed their division of the estate in DATE . In its conclusions , ORG held inter alia that the estate at the time of PERSON \u2019s death could not be considered a party to the case , as the division of the estate had been concluded in DATE .", "On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment , giving the following reasoning :", "\u201c ORG concurs with ORG that in order for the defendant to be held liable for the losses suffered by the [ applicants ] and caused by the guardian , it must be demonstrated that this was due to neglect on the part of the defendant \u2019s employees . The circumstances which resulted in the appointment of the guardian are not entirely clear . Nevertheless , it appears to be established that the person who was appointed guardian had taken the initiative in having the testator deprived of her financial competence ; it appears that there was reason for doing so , and that the mother of the appellants , ORG and ORG , was consulted on this ; she has since died , but at the time she was PERSON \u2019s sole heir . At the time that the guardian was appointed , the estate of a limited company of which he was in charge was the subject of liquidation proceedings , and sentence had been passed on him in the GPE and ORG for not having transferred money which the company had collected from its employees . On the other hand , there is no evidence to suggest that he was not competent to manage his own financial affairs and in other respects he met , formally , the conditions for being appointed as a guardian according to LAW , No . CARDINAL . It has not been established that the District Commissioner should have suspected that he would discharge his duties of financial management badly . With the introduction of LAW , No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , great changes were made in the legal provisions and practice regarding reporting by guardians and the supervision of their work . Repeated attempts by the Commissioner \u2019s employees to have the guardian comply with his statutory duties under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of that Act to report , straightaway in the early part of DATE , produced no result . It can be deduced from the ... ORG judgment of DATE that by that date most of the damage had been done . From the above , it follows that even if the application of the law by the Commissioner \u2019s office should have been more efficient , it has not been established that the Commissioner or his employees violated their official duties and so brought compensatory liability on the defendant . In the light of these considerations , ORG judgment must be upheld . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of LAW , No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , provides :", "\u201c An heir may not dispose of an inheritance which he expects to receive . \u201d", "This provision has been understood as placing a prohibition on any type of disposal , whether by assignment , mortgage or other deed , of an inheritance which has not yet devolved on the recipient . It also follows from this provision that an inheritance that has not yet devolved on the recipient can not be the object of execution measures carried out against the person who expects to receive the inheritance . The rule reflects accepted academic views on the concept of \u201c property \u201d in NORP law . CARDINAL of the foremost conditions for any right to be considered \u201c property \u201d is that it is both unconditional and active so that the owner in question can dispose of it as if it were his property . This provision of LAW confirms these views regarding a future inheritance ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
