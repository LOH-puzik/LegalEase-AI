NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . She is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant visited PERSON at his private practice and was registered as a pregnant patient . During her pregnancy she visited PERSON CARDINAL times and had CARDINAL ultrasound scans which demonstrated that the foetus was developing normally .", "CARDINAL . During a visit on DATE PERSON found that the delivery was imminent . At TIME the pains started . On DATE the applicant was admitted to ORG . The birth did not progress normally . After TIME of labour the applicant and her husband asked PERSON to proceed to a caesarean section . He refused .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s daughter , ORG , was born after TIME . She showed no signs of life and had to be resuscitated , which took TIME . The child suffered from serious health problems ( cerebral palsy ) , mostly of a neurological character and required permanent supervision and medical attention . She could not speak , see or walk .", "CARDINAL . The applicant believed that PERSON was responsible for her daughter \u2019s condition . On DATE a criminal investigation was instituted at her request by ORG .", "CARDINAL . A medical expert opinion submitted to the prosecuting authorities on DATE by specialists from ORG established that there had been serious shortcomings in the manner in which the delivery had been handled . However , the experts concluded that there was insufficient evidence for a finding that the child \u2019s problems had been caused solely by the manner in which she was delivered .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG in GPE found PERSON guilty of a breach of his professional obligations in that he had failed to monitor the child \u2019s condition properly during the second period of the delivery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , referring to this opinion , discontinued the proceedings on the ground that no criminal offence of exposing the child to serious danger to life or limb , punishable under LAW of LAW , had been committed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , indicating shortcomings in the investigation . She submitted , in particular , that the prosecution had failed to take into consideration the case file relating to the professional liability proceedings conducted before the authorities of ORG , and that the criminal proceedings had been conducted superficially . She requested that a number of witnesses be questioned . As a result , the facts of the case had not been established properly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed her appeal , quashed the decision and remitted the case . He observed that the evidence had to be completed by the questioning of the CARDINAL witnesses requested by the applicant , and who had not been questioned so far ; that complete and uptodate medical records of the child had to be included in the file and examined ; that the file from the medical liability proceedings had to be joined to the prosecutor \u2019s file ; and that an additional medical opinion should be sought to complement the findings of the opinion referred to above .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG asked ORG of ORG to complete its earlier expert opinion . It was submitted on DATE . In their opinion the experts stated that there was a causal link between the medical error committed by PERSON in his handling of the applicant \u2019s delivery and her daughter \u2019s condition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG filed an indictment against PERSON with ORG . He was charged with an offence punishable under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( i ) and CARDINAL of LAW by failing to monitor the labour properly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and her daughter declared their intention to become auxiliary prosecutors in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held a session with a view to organising a hearing ( ORG , ORG , II K CARDINAL ) . Subsequently , hearings were scheduled for DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE . Because PERSON failed to attend any of the hearings and none of them was actually held because of his absence , on CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE the court ordered that he be brought to the courtroom . However , apparently no steps were taken to do so . On CARDINAL occasion PERSON was admitted to a psychiatric hospital DATE before the date of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The hearing scheduled for CARDINAL DATE was adjourned , also because of his absence .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on DATE , the court read a letter from a psychiatric hospital in T. Having regard to the doubts which had arisen as to whether PERSON was able to participate in the proceedings , it ordered that an additional expert opinion be prepared in this respect . An opinion was submitted to the court on DATE . The experts found that PERSON suffered from reactive depression accompanied by alcohol abuse and , as a result , was unable to participate in the judicial proceedings for DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer drew the court \u2019s attention to the fact that the experts had failed to address the issue of whether PERSON had himself contributed to his inability to participate in the proceedings . He further submitted that the provisions on criminal procedure allowed for a hearing to be held in the defendant \u2019s absence when it had been shown that he or she had made himself or herself unable to participate in hearings . In the present case the accused had failed to comply with all the summonses and had thereby effectively boycotted the proceedings . On CARDINAL occasion he had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital DATE before the date of the last hearing , which cast doubt on the credibility of the medical certificates he had submitted so far in the case . The applicant \u2019s lawyer further requested that the defendant \u2019s ability to participate be examined by doctors from outside the GPE region . This would , in the applicant \u2019s view , ensure their impartiality .", "CARDINAL . The court allowed his request on DATE and appointed new experts , tasking them with establishing the defendant \u2019s ability to participate in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON died .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court discontinued the criminal proceedings . The applicant appealed against this decision in so far as it concerned costs . The court dismissed the appeal by a decision of DATE , served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s child died .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint against PERSON with ORG ( Okr\u0119gowy PERSON ) at ORG . On DATE the Agent , having completed the investigation , transferred the complaint for examination to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that court found PERSON guilty of a breach of his professional obligations in that he had failed to monitor the child \u2019s condition properly during the second period of the delivery and had failed to notice that the applicant had had an infection during her pregnancy . The court confirmed the fact that largescale damage to the child \u2019s brain had been caused during the labour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE upheld the firstinstance judgment in so far as it concerned the inappropriate monitoring of the child \u2019s condition during the second period of the delivery . The court further concluded that there was insufficient evidence to hold that PERSON had failed to diagnose the infection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , acting on her own behalf and on behalf of her daughter PERSON , sued ORG for damage and suffering caused as a result of medical malpractice during DATE birth . The applicant claimed MONEY ( ORG ) for nonpecuniary damage and a DATE pension of ORG CARDINAL for her inability to work caused by the fact that she had to take care of her daughter . In respect of her daughter the applicant claimed ORG CARDINAL for nonpecuniary damage and a DATE pension in the same amount .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the legal successor of ORG , which had in the meantime changed hands , civilly liable for the applicant \u2019s child \u2019s condition as a result of medical malpractice during the applicant \u2019s labour . It established that the child was totally and permanently incapacitated , required roundtheclock attention and care . It awarded the applicant and her daughter , jointly , compensation in the amount of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having examined the applicant \u2019s appeal , increased the amount of compensation to ORG CARDINAL , plus interest . The court observed that the child had been totally physically incapacitated as a result of cerebral palsy resulting from brain damage caused by the negligent handling of her birth . However , her mental faculties had most likely been intact . She had therefore been locked within her own body which could not but be seen as causing her acute and continuous suffering for not being able to either express herself or to attend to her simplest needs . Her condition necessitated constant care and attention . She had been fragile and often suffered from additional ailments . The court was of the view that the enormity of the child \u2019s infirmity and the applicant \u2019s suffering it caused justified increasing the compensation to be paid by the defendant to ORG CARDINAL . The court held that while compensation for damage to one \u2019s health could not be unduly high so as to cause unfair enrichment , the respect for priceless values such as life and physical integrity dictated that it should be sufficiently elevated so as to offset the negative psychological consequences of medical malpractice .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW of DATE provides that a person who causes grievous bodily harm shall be sentenced to between one and ten years\u2019 imprisonment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
