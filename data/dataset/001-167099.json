In DATE the applicant obtained a loan of CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL \u2013 approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) from the ORG . The purpose of the loan was to build or buy an apartment . In DATE the applicant became the owner of an apartment built by a public association , and in exchange she took over the association \u2019s loan of LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) from the ORG . The apartment was pledged to the bank as collateral . Both loans were given under preferential conditions DATE the DATE interest rate was lower than the average DATE interest rate for loans given by private banks at that time . Both loans were administered by a ORG bank , ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the bank \u201d ) . In DATE that bank transferred the claims to some of its loans , including both of the applicant \u2019s loans , to another ORG bank , ORG . In DATE the latter bank was privatised and became the private bank ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant concluded an agreement with a third party , ORG , under which the applicant paid ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG ) and bought from ORG the right to restoration of title in respect of CARDINAL hectares of land in GPE . That land had belonged to ORG \u2019s grandfather , PERSON , who had died in DATE . It had been determined by a ruling of ORG of DATE that ORG had owned a total of CARDINAL hectares of land in GPE . Following that ruling , ORG sold the right to restoration of title in respect of different parts of that land to CARDINAL individuals , including the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the FAC \u201d ) restored the applicant \u2019s title in respect of QUANTITY of land . At the applicant \u2019s request , her property rights were restored by cancelling her outstanding debt to the State ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The ORG estimated that the value of that plot of land was LTL MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) , and its indexed value was ORG ( ORG CARDINAL ) , an amount equal to the applicant \u2019s outstanding debt under the CARDINAL loan agreements of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG forwarded to ORG a list of individuals , including the applicant , whose property rights it had decided to restore by cancelling their debts to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ordered an internal audit into the restoration of property rights in respect of the land which had belonged to MONEY ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The audit report , delivered on DATE , found that the documents in the possession of the ORG showed that DATE GPE had sold parts of his land to numerous individuals , and that , as a result , at the time of his death he had owned CARDINAL hectares . Accordingly , the audit report considered that the size of GPE \u2019s land , as established by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , had been incorrect , and recommended that the ORG suspend the restoration of property rights in respect of any land which had previously been considered as belonging to GPE", "CARDINAL . Following the internal audit , on DATE the ORG suspended the restoration of property rights in respect of GPE \u2019s land . It informed ORG about the suspension , and asked it to suspend the cancellation of debt for all the individuals on the previously submitted list , including the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the Kaunas Regional Prosecutor ( hereinafter \u201c the prosecutor \u201d ) , at the request of the ORG and relying on the findings of the audit report , asked the domestic courts to reopen the civil proceedings concerning the size of GPE \u2019s land , and to suspend the enforcement of all the ORG \u2019s decisions concerning the restoration of property rights in respect of that land . On DATE ORG suspended the enforcement of the ORG \u2019s decisions . The applicant participated in the court proceedings as a third party and appealed against the suspension , but on DATE ORG dismissed her appeal . On DATE ORG reopened the civil proceedings concerning the size of GPE \u2019s land , on the grounds that the audit report had revealed relevant information which had not been known at the time of the adoption of ORG ruling of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the reopened proceedings , on DATE ORG determined that FAC had owned QUANTITY of land . On DATE the ORG partly amended that judgment and determined that FAC had owned QUANTITY of land . The latter judgment became final . The ORG and the applicant participated in the reopened proceedings as third parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor asked ORG to revoke the order suspending the enforcement of the ORG \u2019s decisions concerning the restoration of property rights in respect of GPE \u2019s land . The prosecutor submitted that the total amount of land affected by those decisions was QUANTITY , so there was no risk of restoring property rights in respect of land which had not belonged to GPE On DATE ORG granted the prosecutor \u2019s application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG asked ORG to resume the cancellation of debt with regard to the applicant and other individuals ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a certificate confirming the cancellation of the applicant \u2019s outstanding debt to the ORG , amounting to ORG ( ORG CARDINAL ) . On that same day the bank received the certificate from ORG and cancelled the applicant \u2019s debt .", "CARDINAL . It appears that from DATE to DATE the applicant did not make any loan repayments to the bank and the bank did not request any such payments . However , until DATE she was paying interest and late payment fines under the CARDINAL loan agreements , and paid a total of ORG EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bank informed the applicant that she owed it LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) in interest and late payment fines under the CARDINAL loan agreements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bank lodged a civil claim against the applicant concerning the unpaid interest and late payment fines under the loan agreement of DATE , amounting to LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) . It asked ORG to order interim measures \u2013 seizing the applicant \u2019s apartment . On DATE the bank unilaterally terminated the loan agreement of DATE and asked the court to begin the forced recovery of the debt under that agreement , amounting to ORG ( ORG CARDINAL ) , by seizing the applicant \u2019s apartment , which had been pledged to the bank as collateral .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG seized the applicant \u2019s apartment and informed her that , following her failure to repay the debt under the loan agreement of DATE within DATE , the apartment would be sold at auction . The following day the court also granted the bank \u2019s application for interim measures concerning the loan agreement of DATE , but having found that the applicant \u2019s apartment had already been seized , the court ordered the seizure of the applicant \u2019s movable property , financial assets and property rights , amounting to the sum of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a counterclaim against the bank . She stated that on DATE the ORG had restored her property rights by cancelling her debt to the ORG , but due to circumstances beyond the applicant \u2019s control ORG had only informed the bank about the cancellation on DATE . The applicant submitted that from DATE until DATE she had repeatedly contacted the bank and asked it to not count the interest and late payment fines . Thus , she considered that the bank had known about the cancellation of her debt , and it was therefore unjust and unfair for it to ask her for any payments for that period , or to unilaterally terminate the loan agreement of DATE . The applicant further asserted that in the period of CARDINAL she had paid the bank a total of ORG EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) in interest and late payment fines under the CARDINAL loan agreements ; she claimed that there had been no grounds for the bank to accept those payments , and asked the court to order the bank to return them to her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the applicant \u2019s request , ORG suspended the forced recovery of the debt by means of seizing the applicant \u2019s apartment , pending the examination of the claim and counterclaim in the civil case . On DATE the court lifted the order for seizure of the applicant \u2019s apartment because the bank had not requested its sale at auction within the time - limit prescribed by law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the bank \u2019s civil claim in part . The court found that the applicant \u2019s debt had only been cancelled on DATE , so there were no grounds to find that her obligation to honour the loan agreement with the bank had ended before that date . The court held that the applicant had been using the loan during DATE , and thus she was obliged to pay interest to the bank . Accordingly , it ordered the applicant to pay the bank LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "However , ORG also noted that the loan had been given to the applicant by the ORG and not by the bank , so the latter could not claim to have suffered any losses due to late payments . The court found no bad faith on the part of the applicant \u2013 it considered that she had had legitimate grounds to expect that the cancellation of her debt , ordered on DATE , would be implemented promptly . Accordingly , the court decided that the bank had no grounds to claim late payment fines , and ordered it to return to the applicant LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) which she had already paid .", "The applicant \u2019s counterclaim was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against that judgment , but on DATE ORG dismissed her appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment in its entirety . The court considered that the applicant had to assume the risks resulting from her agreement with ORG , which had enabled her to seek the cancellation of her outstanding debt after paying a sum that was several times lower than that debt ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) , especially as the bank had not been a party to that agreement . The court also noted that the delay in the cancellation of the applicant \u2019s debt had been caused not by the actions of the bank but by those of the ORG and the prosecutor , so the bank had had the right to receive interest payments during the period in question .", "CARDINAL . In those proceedings , the courts did not examine whether the applicant had been under an obligation to pay interest and late payment fines under the loan agreement of DATE , because she had not made such a claim . As submitted by the applicant and not disputed by the ORG , on an unspecified date in DATE the applicant paid LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) in interest and late payment fines requested by the bank under that agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted to ORG a civil claim for damages against the ORG , ORG and ORG . She claimed that because of the unnecessary and unjustified delay in the cancellation of her debt from DATE until DATE , caused jointly by those CARDINAL institutions , she had suffered financial losses of ORG MONEY ) , consisting of interest and late payment fines paid under the CARDINAL loan agreements , as well as legal expenses incurred in the civil proceedings instituted by the bank . She also claimed non - pecuniary damages of LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) for the stress and frustration caused during that delay .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to accept the applicant \u2019s claim , on the grounds that complaints against ORG and ORG \u2013 and , as a result , the entire claim \u2013 had to be examined by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted to ORG a civil claim for damages against the ORG only . She again claimed pecuniary damages of ORG and non - pecuniary damages of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of damage allegedly caused by the unjustified delay in the cancellation of her debt . The applicant argued that the ORG had acted unlawfully by suspending the restoration of her property rights and asking the prosecutor to apply for the reopening of the civil proceedings concerning the size of GPE \u2019s land . ORG and ORG participated in the proceedings as third parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It held that the principle of the rule of law obliged the LAW to ensure that the restoration of property rights was conducted in accordance with the applicable laws . The court considered that , in the presence of well - founded doubts about the actual size of the land owned by MONEY , the ORG had acted lawfully and diligently by suspending the restoration of the property rights and initiating the reopening of the proceedings . The fact that the courts dealing with the reopened proceedings had found that FAC had owned less land than initially determined ( CARDINAL hectares and QUANTITY , as opposed to the initial estimate of QUANTITY ) showed that the suspension had had a proper basis . Accordingly , the court concluded that the ORG had acted lawfully and there were no grounds to award damages to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment , but on DATE ORG dismissed her appeal and concluded that the ORG \u2019s actions in initiating the suspension of its decisions concerning the restoration of property rights had been in accordance with domestic law . In addition , ORG distinguished between the ORG \u2019s competence and that of ORG : while the ORG was responsible for the restoration of property rights , it was ORG which had the authority to cancel the applicant \u2019s debt and issue the bank with a certificate confirming such cancellation . The ORG \u2019s request of ORG to suspend the cancellation of the applicant \u2019s debt ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had not been legally binding on the Ministry , and had had no legal effect on the cancellation of the debt . The court further held that the suspension of restoration of the applicant \u2019s property rights had been ordered not by the ORG but by the ruling of ORG of DATE , and the ruling had been revoked by that same court only on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . Accordingly , ORG concluded that the ORG could not be held responsible for the suspension of the restoration of the applicant \u2019s property rights and the cancellation of her debt , and thus there were no grounds to award her damages ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
