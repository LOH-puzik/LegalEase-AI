The applicant 's mother stated , among other things , that she felt that it was worst for the applicant during the detention period when he was also solitary confined .

Having regard to the findings on the evidence in ORG verdict of CARDINAL DATE , and to the evidence produced during these proceedings , the court finds it established that an agreement had been concluded between ORG and MP on the smuggling of cocaine from GPE to GPE so that the cocaine was to be hidden in a consignment of papaya fruits . Accordingly , in GPE MP placed the cocaine in a pallet with green papaya fruits to be imported by the firm ... , from which [ the applicant ] had ordered the fruits . However , PL had tricked [ the applicant ] into establishing ... a health firm , and ordering the papaya fruits via this firm by stating that the import of green papaya fruits was to cover smuggling of diamonds , although to PL cocaine was involved . After the arrival [ of the papaya fruits ] complications arose whereby the smuggled cocaine was discovered .", "[ The applicant ] had taken initiatives as to the potential commercial exploitation of green papaya fruits for health products , etc .", "The court finds that [ the applicant ] has exhibited considerable contributory negligence by embarking on an agreement with ORG on the smuggling of diamonds from GPE . He knew that PERSON was a trained gemmologist , but their acquaintance was of recent date and his efforts to ensure that PERSON 's criminal intention was limited to diamond smuggling were poor . PERSON 's statement to the effect that at some time he briefly remarked to [ the applicant ] that he had previously tried to smuggle cocaine is contested by [ the applicant ] and no decisive weight has been attached to it in this assessment of the evidence .", "... On the evidence [ before it ] the court finds that [ the applicant ] started establishing [ the health firm ] to be in charge of the import of papaya fruits etc . after having agreed with ORG to assist in smuggling diamonds from GPE hidden in consignments of papaya fruits . According to the evidence it can not be excluded that [ the applicant ] also intended to obtain a commercial profit from [ the health firm ] . However , having regard to the applicant 's knowledge of the discovery of the cocaine and to the police interviews in general , the court finds that [ the applicant ] should have realised that the investigation theory of the police was that [ his established health firm ] was only a cover for the import of cocaine , and that any profit from the sale of health products made from papaya fruits was quite immaterial . Furthermore , the court notes that [ the applicant 's ] rather experimental / impulsive way of starting up his firm was suited to strengthen this assumption by the police , and that the applicant should have realised this .", "After the police had found the cocaine and after the press publicity on DATE , but before his own arrest , [ the applicant ] chose together with ORG to agree on a false statement about the background of his import of papaya fruits , ... [ the story about ORG and ORG ] supported by construed diary notes . [ The applicant ] maintains that he asked PERSON repeatedly at this stage whether PERSON had anything to do with the cocaine .

Such a strain manifests itself even more with regard to pre - trial detention in solitary confinement , which entails complete exclusion from association with other inmates , and visits only to a limited extent and subject to surveillance . In some cases this strain may , for a particular individual , prove to have consequences beyond what is generally foreseeable and predictable by the legislator owing to that individual 's mental preparedness and life situation in general .", "It must be presumed that the legislator considers solitary confinement necessary for the sake of the investigation , particularly in grave criminal cases committed by a group of persons acting in a more organised way , in which the clearing up to a great extent depends on the persons ' lack of opportunities to harmonise their statements mutually and with others .", "In order to balance the interests of the detainee against the interest of the society in prosecuting crimes , the legislator has laid down provisions on solitary confinement cf . sections CARDINALa to CARDINALc of ORG . Thus , the use of totally solitary confinement is limited to a continuous period of DATE [ except for ] cases , where the charge concerns an offence being punishable under the law by imprisonment for DATE or more , which are not subject to any restriction in time . The charge against [ the applicant ] for drug offences under LAW satisfies this condition . Under section CARDINALb , the courts must check whether the purpose of the solitary confinement can be fulfilled by less radical measures , and they must ensure that the measure is not disproportionate to the importance of the case and the sanction that may be expected if the person charged is found guilty . Furthermore , under this provision the court must \u201c take into account the special potential strain on the person charged owing to his youth , or physical or mental weakness \u201d when it orders solitary confinement .", "In the opinion of the court , the legislator has thus realised that solitary confinement may at worst result in an unintended harmful effect owing to the mental weakness of the person charged . This is attempted countered by imposing a duty on ORG staff ( kriminalforsorgens personale ) , including the prison doctor , to be aware of any danger signals , according to which psychiatric monitoring may prove relevant .", "The question of medical monitoring may be raised by everybody who is in contact with the detainee , including counsel , as well as the detainee himself and the prison staff . If so , the judge responsible for a continuation of the pre - trial detention in solitary confinement must decide whether the interest of society in prosecution must give way for the mental wellbeing of the person charged , with particular regard to the risk of permanent mental harm .", "It is a matter for the courts to check and apply the provisions of the law compared with general principles of law , including the principles expressed in LAW ... as incorporated into NORP law by LAW .

With regard to solitary confinement the court finds that a strengthened degree of culpability must be employed towards the public authorities .", "It may be difficult for the surroundings to recognise in particular a paranoid psychosis . However , having regard to the information provided by [ the applicant ] about his claustrophobia and his contemplation of suicide , which resulted in his placement in an observation cell , the court finds that [ the applicant ] , maybe already at the time of the arrest , behaved in such a way that could and should have caused a closer observance in the period to follow , than were actually performed of [ the applicant 's ] mental development , in any case subsequent to [ the applicant 's ] hunger strike in DATE . The court finds that the authorities carry the burden of proof that the [ above ] circumstances have had no influence on the psychiatric damage incurred .

Numerous allegations were made as regards the adverse effects of such confinement . The ORG wishes to underline that , in certain circumstances , solitary confinement could amount to inhuman and degrading treatment , and that in any event all forms of solitary confinement should be as short as possible . The question of solitary confinement is currently being examined by the NORP authorities . The ORG , for its part , has formulated several recommendations designed to strengthen the protection of prisoners in this area . Emphasis is placed in particular on the importance of the respect of the principle of proportionality between the requirements of the investigation and placement in solitary confinement ( a measure which can have very harmful consequences for the persons concerned ) , of an effective periodic judicial review of the solitary confinement , and of the proper medical examination of a prisoner subject to such a measure .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also visited GPE from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL October CARDINAL . Its findings with regard to solitary confinement , and the condition of FAC were the following ( ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ) :", "CARDINAL . Solitary confinement of remand prisoners by court order", "CARDINAL . In the course of its ongoing dialogue with the NORP authorities , the ORG has stressed that all forms of solitary confinement without appropriate mental and physical stimulation are likely in the long term to have damaging effects , resulting in deterioration of mental faculties and social abilities . It has paid particular attention to the solitary confinement of remand prisoners by court order , which can continue for extended periods .", "CARDINAL . The NORP authorities have long recognised the importance of this subject and , in DATE , the Minister of ORG commissioned a research project to examine \" any possible harmful effects of being remanded in custody in solitary confinement \" . The results of that research were published , in a report entitled \" Remand in Custody and Mental Health \" , in DATE .", "The research team found that : \" ... remand in custody in solitary confinement versus non - solitary confinement involves the risk of harmful effects on mental health \" and that \" ... there is a greater probability that those in solitary confinement develop mental problems and are transferred to prison hospitals for mental reasons than those who are not placed in solitary confinement \" . ( cf . page CARDINAL of document ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ) However , researchers found no proven link between the length of judicially - ordered solitary confinement and prisoners ' mental health .", "The report concludes that : \" ... the harmful effects of solitary confinement are not in general such as to result in abnormalities in the cognitive functions , e.g. concentration and memory \" . ( cf . page CARDINAL of document ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ) .", "ORG is currently examining the findings of \" Remand in Custody and ORG \" , with a view to re - assessing the rules governing placement in judicially ordered solitary confinement . In addition , the same research team is producing a follow - up study , which is to be published in the form of a supplementary report .", "CARDINAL . The ORG welcomes the fact that the mental health of prisoners in judicially ordered solitary confinement has been the subject of a study . However , it feels bound to point out that , during its DATE visit , a considerable number of doctors , lawyers , prison staff and other persons who have frequent contact with such inmates expressed considerable surprise at the study 's principal conclusion . In their experience , prisoners subjected to lengthy periods of judicially ordered solitary confinement frequently exhibited lapses in concentration , memory loss and impaired social skills . These observations were borne out by the ORG 's own findings during its second periodic visit . Many prisoners subject to judicially ordered solitary confinement complained of symptoms including anxiety , depression , inability to concentrate , irregular sleeping patterns , nausea and persistent headaches . In CARDINAL particular case , the delegation 's psychiatric expert was of the opinion that symptoms such as impairment of concentration , depressive mood and suicidal thoughts could be attributed to the inmate 's lengthy placement in solitary confinement .", "In short , notwithstanding the principal conclusion of \" Remand in Custody and ORG \" , the ORG considers that there remain serious grounds for concern about the effects upon remand prisoners ' mental health of being placed in judicially - ordered solitary confinement for prolonged periods .", "CARDINAL . In addition to stressing that all forms of solitary confinement should be as short as possible , the ORG 's DATE report recommended that the NORP authorities take steps to ensure that remand prisoners were only placed in solitary confinement in exceptional circumstances which were strictly limited to the actual requirements of the case . It also recommended that there be an effective judicial review of placements in solitary confinement and that , where a placement was prolonged , the reasons for such prolongation be set out in writing ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL of document ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ) .", "In their response , the NORP authorities asserted that NORP law was already in accordance with these recommendations and cited a steady fall in the number of remand prisoners being placed in judicially - ordered solitary confinement .", "CARDINAL . The ORG welcomes the above - mentioned fall . However , the information gathered during the second periodic visit would suggest that - at least in respect of certain types of cases ( serious drugs offences , crimes of violence etc . ) - the balance between the legitimate requirements of a criminal investigation and the potentially harmful effects of imposing solitary confinement is still not being struck in an appropriate way . As an example , senior police officers , prosecutors and judges with whom the delegation spoke agreed that it would be extremely unusual were solitary confinement not to be sought ( and granted ) in a case brought under LAW of ORG ( which deals with serious drugs offences ) . It is also noteworthy that a detailed examination of the court transcript of a randomly - selected LAW case showed that no specific reasons had been given by the judge for imposing solitary confinement ; instead , he had simply cited the statute which authorised him to grant the prosecutor 's request .", "Furthermore , although it is true that the statistical information which has been supplied by the NORP authorities shows a downward trend in the number of placements in solitary confinement , it also indicates that the average length of solitary confinement has increased . Indeed , in the course of the DATE visit , the ORG 's delegation met a number of prisoners who had been subject to judicially ordered solitary confinement for long periods of time ( one for DATE , CARDINAL for DATE and CARDINAL for DATE or more ) .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the information set out above , the ORG considers that further action is required to ensure that the safeguards in NORP law concerning the placement of remand prisoners in solitary confinement are rendered fully effective in practice . The ORG recommends that steps be taken to ensure that : - prosecutors are reminded that they should only seek a placement in solitary confinement when this is strictly necessary in the interests of a particular criminal investigation ; - on every occasion when the question of whether to impose or prolong solitary confinement is raised before a court , the reasoned grounds for the decision which results are recorded in writing ; - prisoners are systematically informed in straightforward language of the reasons for their placement in judicially - ordered solitary confinement ; - in the context of each periodic review of the necessity to continue remand in custody , the necessity to continue a placement in solitary confinement is fully considered as a separate issue , bearing in mind the general principle that all placements in solitary confinement should be as short as possible . ORG also invites the NORP authorities to consider introducing a maximum limit on the total period for which a remand prisoner may be placed in solitary confinement .", "CARDINAL . The effect upon remand prisoners of being placed in judicially ordered solitary confinement can be exacerbated by the imposition of prohibitions / restrictions upon their letters and visits . The imposition of such restrictions lies within the sole discretion of the police ( although a prisoner may appeal to a court against the imposition of restrictions ) . In the course of its second visit , the delegation found that the police rarely if ever sought to prohibit letters or visits ; however , it was common for remand prisoners ' letters to be monitored and their visits supervised . In its report on the first visit , the ORG recommended that the police be given clear instructions on the circumstances in which such prohibitions / restrictions might be imposed and required to state the reasons in writing for any such measures . This recommendation has not been implemented by the NORP authorities , who consider that ORG already provides sufficient safeguards in this respect .", "In the view of the ORG , the current system of police - imposed restrictions upon letters and visits still does not adequately ensure that the measures adopted in a given case will be strictly proportionate to the needs of the criminal investigation involved . Accordingly , the ORG recommends that the NORP authorities take steps to implement its DATE recommendation on this subject without further delay . The ORG also recommends that , in the context of each periodic review by a court of the necessity to continue remand in custody , the question of the necessity for the police to continue to impose particular restrictions upon a remand prisoner 's visits and letters be considered as a separate issue .", "CARDINAL . As regards the question of activities for remand prisoners placed in judicially - ordered solitary confinement , the ORG was pleased to note that ORG fully agrees with the ORG 's view that persons in solitary confinement should be provided with access to purposeful activities and appropriate human contact in order to counteract the effects of being placed in solitary confinement ( cf . page CARDINAL of document ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ) . During the second periodic visit , the delegation noted that efforts were being made to achieve this objective in the establishments visited . The ORG recommends that the NORP authorities pursue their efforts in this respect .", "CARDINAL .

ORG replied inter alia as follows :", "According to the existing NORP legislation , only the courts can decide whether a suspect may be placed in solitary confinement and that such a decision requires that certain conditions are met , i.e. that the suspect is remanded in custody because he or she must be prevented from influencing other suspects through other inmates or in any other way . Total isolation was only possible for a maximum period of DATE unless the person involved was charged with a criminal offence punishable by DATE imprisonment or more . Furthermore , the principle of proportionality must be observed \u2013 hence , if the purpose of the solitary confinement may be achieved through other means of less vital importance , or if the solitary confinement is disproportionate to the importance of the case and the legal consequences to be expected if the suspect is found guilty , solitary confinement must not be used . When deciding this matter , the judge must also take into account the strain , which solitary confinement may put upon the suspect due to the suspect 's young age or mental or physical weakness . The ORG also pointed out that the number of persons kept in solitary confinement was decreasing significantly over DATE and that the conditions to be met in order to keep someone in solitary confinement were among the strictest in LOC ;", "Only the courts can decide to detain a suspect in solitary confinement and the courts ' decisions regarding this issue must explain in detail the reasons for this decision ;", "The staff of ORG has been instructed to inform the prison doctor / nurse in all cases where a prisoner wishes to get medical attention .

Such medical information will form part of the considerations of the courts when deciding whether solitary confinement is proportionate in the case in question ;", "ORG contains specific provisions concerning prohibitions / restrictions of the prisoners ' correspondence and visits , and a prisoner who is subjected to such restrictions has a right to request that the decisions be brought before a court ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
