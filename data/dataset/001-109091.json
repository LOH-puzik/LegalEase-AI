The court noted that the doctor had been informed of it and had asked the court to proceed without him .", "CARDINAL . In her application form to the ORG , the applicant alleged that at the beginning of the hearing the judge had ordered her to leave her place next to ORG and to sit next to the judge . The judge had also ordered ORG to keep her eyes off the applicant \u201d . Given that this was not reflected in the transcript of the hearing , on DATE PERSON had written to the court asking that the transcript be rectified accordingly .", "CARDINAL . According to the transcript of the hearing , at the beginning thereof ORG requested that an audio recording be made . The judge refused the request . The applicant asked to be assisted by a lawyer . The judge refused her request , deeming that her guardian was assisted by a lawyer before the court . Without the agreement of her guardian , a separate lawyer could not be appointed . The lawyer hired by the applicant \u2019s guardian was held to represent both the interests of the applicant and her guardian .", "CARDINAL . As the transcript of the hearing shows , the applicant went on to unequivocally state that she stood by her request that the guardianship proceedings be reopened . She argued that she had neither been informed of the proceedings as to her incapacitation , nor those pursuant to which her guardian had been appointed . The decisions had been taken while she had been in hospital . During the hearing , the applicant expressed her willingness to leave the K\u0117dainiai Home and stated that she was being kept and treated there by force . She submitted that she would prefer to live at her adoptive father \u2019s home and to attend a day centre ( lankys dienos u\u017eimtumo centr\u0105 ) . The applicant also argued that ORG had been forced to surrender her duties as her guardian and to allow the applicant \u2019s adoptive father to become her guardian because of pressure from him with the aim of transferring the applicant \u2019s flat to him . The applicant also noted that in the K\u0117dainiai Home she was cut off from society and had been deprived of the opportunity to make telephone calls . Her friends could not visit her and she was not allowed to go to the cinema . In the K\u0117dainiai Home \u201c she was isolated and saw only a fence \u201d . The other parties to the proceedings opposed the applicant \u2019s wish that the guardianship proceedings be reopened .", "CARDINAL . In her application to the ORG , the applicant alleged that during a break in the hearing she had been ordered to follow the judge to her private office . When the applicant had refused , she had been threatened with restraint by psychiatric personnel . In private , the judge had instructed her not to say anything negative about her adoptive father and that , should she not comply , her friend PERSON would also be declared legally incapacitated . As stated in ORG \u2019s letter seeking rectification of the transcript ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) , after the break was announced the applicant had wished to stay in the hearing room . However , she had been taken away and had returned very depressed ( prisl\u0117gta ) . Responding to a question by the judge as to her guardianship , the applicant replied : \u201c I agree that [ my adoptive father ] should be my guardian , because God asks that people be forgiving . I just wish that he [ would ] take me [ away ] from [ the K\u0117dainiai Home ] to GPE , to his place ... and let me see PERSON and my friends \u201d .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the transcript of the hearing that after the break , when giving her submissions to the court , the applicant agreed to keep her adoptive father as guardian , but insisted on being released from institutional care in order to live with her adoptive father . The relevant ORG institutions \u2013 ORG , ORG , the prosecutor , ORG of ORG \u2013 and the applicant \u2019s guardian \u2019s lawyer each argued that the applicant \u2019s request for reopening was clearly unfounded and should be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Kaunas City District Court refused to reopen the guardianship proceedings on the basis of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , ruling that there were no grounds to change the guardian ( see Relevant domestic law part below ) . The court noted that before appointing the applicant \u2019s adoptive father as her guardian , ORG had prepared a report on the proposed appointment of the applicant \u2019s guardian and had questioned the applicant , who had not been able to provide an objective opinion about that appointment . The court confirmed that the applicant had not been summoned to the hearing of DATE , when her guardian was appointed , as the court had taken into consideration the applicant \u2019s mental state and , on the basis of the findings of the relevant health care officials , had not considered her involvement in the hearing necessary . The court further noted that the findings had disclosed tense relations between the applicant and her adoptive father . Even so , the applicant \u2019s adoptive father had been duly performing his duties . The court also referred to statements of the representatives of ORG and the director of ORG to the effect that the applicant \u2019s contact with ORG had had a negative influence on her mental health .", "CARDINAL . GPE proceeded to fine ORG litai ( LTL ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) for abuse of process . It noted that ORG had filed numerous complaints before various ORG institutions and the courts of alleged violations of the applicant \u2019s rights . Those complaints had prompted several inquiries which had revealed a lack of substantiation . The court noted :", "\u201c ... by such an abuse of rights , [ ORG ] caused damage to the ORG , namely the waste of time and money of the court and the participants in the proceedings . The court concludes that [ ORG ] has abused her rights ... and the vulnerability of the incapacitated person \u201d .", "CARDINAL . D.G. appealed against the above decision . She noted , inter alia , that the DATE ruling to appoint the applicant \u2019s adoptive father as her guardian had been adopted by judge PERSON The same judge had dismissed the applicant \u2019s request that the court proceedings be reopened , although this was explicitly prohibited by LAW .", "The applicant also submitted a brief in support of ORG appeal , arguing that persons admitted to psychiatric institutions should have a right to know the reasons for their admission . Moreover , they should be able to contact a lawyer who is independent from the institution to which they have been admitted .", "CARDINAL . The appeal by ORG was dismissed by ORG on DATE in written proceedings . The court did not rule on the plea that the district court judge PERSON had been partial .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG declared PERSON \u2019s subsequent appeal on points of law inadmissible , as it had not been submitted by a lawyer and raised no important legal issues .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE GPE , following a public hearing attended by social services representatives and the applicant \u2019s legal guardian , granted the guardian \u2019s request to be relieved from the duties of guardian and property administrator . The applicant \u2019s adoptive father had argued that he was no longer fit to be her guardian because of his old age ( DATE at that time ) and state of health . The K\u0117dainiai Home was appointed temporary guardian and property administrator . The applicant was not present at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , GPE held a public hearing and appointed the K\u0117dainiai Home as the applicant \u2019s permanent guardian and administrator of her property rights . The applicant was not present at that hearing ; the court did not give reasons for her absence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a criminal inquiry was opened on the initiative of some of the applicant \u2019s acquaintances , who alleged that the applicant had been the victim of NORP - style classification of illnesses which was designed to repress those who fall foul of the regime . The complainants submitted that , as a result of the persistent diagnoses of schizophrenia , the applicant had been unlawfully deprived of her liberty , had been ill - treated and had been overmedicated in the K\u0117dainiai Home , and that her property rights had been violated by her guardian .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation was discontinued , no evidence having been found of an abuse of the applicant \u2019s interests , either pecuniary or personal . It was established that the immovable property belonging to the applicant had been let to a third person , with the proceeds used to satisfy the applicant \u2019s needs . The applicant had had a bank account opened in her name on DATE , and the deposit made on DATE had since been left untouched . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s guardian had transferred to her account the sum received from the sale of their common property . There was thus no indication that the applicant \u2019s adoptive father had abused his position as guardian .", "CARDINAL . As regards the deprivation of the applicant \u2019s liberty , the prosecutor noted that the applicant had been admitted to an institutional care facility in accordance with the applicable legislation . The prosecutor acknowledged that the freedom of the applicant \u201c to choose her place of residence [ was ] restricted ( laisv\u0117 pasirinkti buvimo viet\u0105 ORG ribojama ) \u201d , but further noted that she was :", "\u201c ... constrained to an extent no greater than necessary in order to take due care of her as a legally incapacitated person . The guardian of [ the applicant ] can change her place of residence without first obtaining a separate official decision ; she is not unlawfully hospitalised . Therefore , her placement in the K\u0117dainiai Home can not be classified as an unlawful deprivation of liberty , punishable under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor had also conducted an inquiry into an incident which had occurred at the K\u0117dainiai Home on DATE . After questioning the personnel of the Home , it was established that on DATE the applicant had been placed in the intensive supervision ward ( intensyvaus steb\u0117jimo kambarys ) , had been given an additional dose of tranquilisers ( QUANTITY of PERSON ) and had been tied down ( fiksuota ) for TIME by social care staff .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor noted the explanation of the psychiatrist at the Home , who admitted that the applicant \u2019s restraint had been carried out in breach of the applicable rules , without the approval of medical personnel . However , after having read written reports on the incident produced by the social care personnel , he considered the tying down to have been undertaken in order to save the applicant \u2019s life and not in breach of her rights .", "CARDINAL . Questioned by the prosecution as witnesses , social workers at the K\u0117dainiai Home testified that DATE had been the only occasion on which the applicant had been physically restrained and placed in isolation . The measures had only been taken because at that particular time the applicant had shown suicidal tendencies .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor concluded that the submissions made by the complainants were insufficient to find that the applicant \u2019s right to liberty had been violated by unnecessary restraint or that she had suffered degrading treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the higher prosecutor upheld that decision .", "CARDINAL . With the assistance of ORG , the applicant addressed a number of complaints to various ORG authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in reply to a police inquiry into the applicant \u2019s complaint of unlawful detention in the K\u0117dainiai Home , ORG department wrote that \u201c [ in ] DATE , relations between the applicant and her adoptive father have been tense . Therefore , on the wish of both of them , until DATE [ the applicant \u2019s ] legal guardian was PERSON and not her adoptive father \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG also commissioned an inquiry , including conducting an examination of the applicant \u2019s living conditions at the K\u0117dainiai Home and interviews with the applicant and the management of the Home . The commission established that the applicant \u2019s living conditions were not exemplary ( n\u0117ra labai geros ) , but it was promised that the inhabitants would soon move to new LOC with better conditions . However , it was noted that the applicant received adequate care . The commission opined that it was advisable not to disturb the applicant , given her vulnerability and instability . It was also emphasised that the ORG authorities were under an obligation to be diligent as regards supervision of how the guardians use their rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG filed a complaint with the police , alleging that the applicant had been unlawfully deprived of her liberty and of contact with people from outside FAC . By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the police replied that no violation of the applicant \u2019s rights had been found . They explained that , in accordance with the internal rules of ORG , residents could be visited by their relatives and guardians , but other people required the approval of the management . At the request of the applicant \u2019s guardian , the management had prohibited other people from visiting her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE upon the inspection performed by food safety authorities out - of - date frozen meat ( best before CARDINAL DATE ) was found in the K\u0117dainiai Home . However , there was no indication that that meat would have been used for cooking .
