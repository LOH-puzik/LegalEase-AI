He was represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE a NORP ORG convicted the applicant of , inter alia , aggravated tax fraud and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In an administrative procedure he was ordered to pay outstanding taxes , which he failed to do . Therefore , the NORP authorities requested judicial assistance in the enforcement of those claims .", "On DATE the applicant was apprehended for the purpose of an enforcement inquiry ( ulosottoselvitys , uts\u00f6kningsutredning ) conducted within the framework of a debt recovery procedure in GPE .", "The applicant was cautioned by the Bailiff ( ulosottomies , utm\u00e4tningsmannen ) to the effect that he was under an obligation to give truthful information under penalty of a fine and that giving incorrect information or withholding information could constitute fraud . A policeman who had brought in the applicant was present during the inquiry .", "The applicant stated that he owned a ORG watch and a Mercedes car . He also owned a ORG motorcycle , which was in GPE . He maintained that he had no other assets in GPE or elsewhere . The Bailiff seized the watch and the car .", "On DATE the applicant was detained as a suspect in an aggravated debtor \u2019s fraud as it was alleged that he had concealed assets in the enforcement inquiry on DATE . He was also suspected of having made erroneous register entries concerning a number of vehicles other than those mentioned above .", "A summary part of a pre - trial investigation report relating to the case indicated the following :", "\u201c This investigation is based on an information notice made on DATE by ORG ( rahoitustarkastus , finansinspektionen ) to ORG ( keskusrikospoliisi , centralkriminalpolisen ) concerning suspected money laundering . According to the notice the [ bank O. ] had , on DATE , received from abroad a payment of MONEY ( ORG ) to be transferred to a person called [ M.M. ] . The sender of the money had been a person called [ the applicant ] , who resides in GPE .", "During the examination into the matter it came to light that on DATE [ FAC ] appeared to have lent from his cash funds a sum of FIM CARDINAL,CARDINAL to [ company \u00c4 ] for the purchase of real estate owned by [ company ORG ] . [ M.M. ] had concealed that claim in an enforcement inquiry conducted on DATE . A criminal report no . CARDINAL concerning that matter was registered by ORG on DATE in respect of [ FAC ] on suspicion of debtor \u2019s fraud and other offences . In the course of that investigation , it was discovered that the above payment of ORG had not been genuine and that , de facto , the receipt confirming that payment had been drawn up to conceal from [ the applicant \u2019s ] creditors the financial arrangements concerning and the true ownership of his possessions . On that account , [ investigator A. ] of the GPE unit of ORG decided to institute pre - trial investigations into , firstly , a suspected receiving offence , report no . CARDINAL/R/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , and later a suspected debtor \u2019s fraud , report no . CARDINAL . The basis for these suspicions has been [ the applicant \u2019s ] conviction in DATE of tax fraud in GPE and [ his ] concealing from the NORP State assets acquired through business activities for the purpose of avoiding tax and [ other ] payments . This had formed the basis of a claim for ORG DATE by ORG in respect of [ the applicant ] . The assets thus gained , and concealed , have subsequently been transferred to GPE by partly using moneys to purchase property , in appearance , for [ the applicant \u2019s ] immediate circle . The initial offence relating to the possible receiving offence [ in this connection ] was the aggravated tax fraud of which [ the applicant ] was convicted in DATE .", "The NORP State ( Kronofogdemyndigheten ) has , as a creditor , requested the NORP authorities to undertake enforcement measures to recover its claim of ORG DATE . In the pre - trial investigation , conducted for the above reasons , it has emerged [ circumstances ] , to be specified hereafter , giving probable cause to suspect that , de facto , property acquired under the name of other persons is controlled by [ the applicant ] and purchased with his moneys and that , at the time of the enforcement measures conducted on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , he has had in his possession abroad moneys which have been concealed in the enforcement proceedings . \u201d", "On DATE and DATE charges were brought against the applicant for aggravated debtor \u2019s fraud , CARDINAL registration offences and CARDINAL counts of instigation to commit registration offences . As to the fraud charge , the prosecutor alleged that the applicant had failed on DATE to account for moneys on CARDINAL foreign bank accounts , a property in GPE , shares in a NORP limited liability company , shares in CARDINAL NORP housing companies and CARDINAL cars . CARDINAL of those cars , an Opel , was also the object of CARDINAL of the alleged registration offences . According to the prosecutor the applicant had on DATE registered that car as belonging to another person X. although he had been its true owner .", "The applicant denied having concealed any possessions in the enforcement inquiry held on DATE , arguing that he was not the owner of the property mentioned in the bills of indictment . The applicant submitted that the prosecutor was wrong in assuming that he was in the possession of proceeds of the tax fraud , for which he had been convicted in GPE . Even if that were the case , it would not constitute a separate offence . Nor could a person be punished for not giving information concerning such property in subsequent enforcement proceedings . As to the alleged registration offences and instigation thereto the applicant contended that all the information given to the registration authorities had been accurate .", "Further , the applicant contended that in the enforcement inquiry of DATE he had been forced , under pain of a fine and in the presence of a police officer , to divulge self - incriminating information . As he , at the material time , had been suspected of at least money laundering , the procedure had been in breach of LAW .", "On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) convicted the applicant of aggravated debtor \u2019s fraud and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment having found that he had concealed in the enforcement inquiry the moneys in CARDINAL of the foreign bank accounts , the property in GPE , the shares in NORP companies and the Opel car . As to the moneys in the other foreign bank account and the other car , the court found that it had not been established that they had belonged to the applicant at the time of the enforcement inquiry . The court ordered the applicant to pay ORG some ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in damages . The charges concerning registration offences and instigation thereto were dismissed .", "As to the applicant \u2019s argument concerning the alleged self - incrimination , ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] is facing charges for concealing property in an enforcement inquiry carried out on DATE . [ He ] has on that occasion informed [ the Bailiff ] that he had no other property , either in GPE or abroad , than what transpired from the enforcement protocol .", "...", "[ The applicant ] has submitted that a policeman was present at the enforcement inquiry . [ The applicant ] was then required , under threat of a fine and in the presence of the policeman , to give information concerning an offence . In the light of the material submitted [ to the court ] it is possible that , in addition to the enforcement authorities , a policeman was present at the inquiry . However , [ the applicant ] had not at that time been suspected of any offence concerning which evidence could have been obtained through [ that ] inquiry . [ The Bailiff ] has submitted that he had been informed by the police that [ the applicant ] had been driving a [ ORG car ] . Relying on that information , he had decided to carry out an enforcement inquiry and seize the car . ...", "No evidence has been presented [ to the court ] that obtaining information about an offence had been even the subsidiary goal of the enforcement inquiry . The only function of that inquiry had been to gain information about [ the applicant \u2019s ] property . By submitting information in the enforcement inquiry about his property abroad [ the applicant ] would not have incriminated himself on account of any offence . [ He ] would not have been obliged to provide information concerning the origin of the assets . As a matter of fact , he had already been sentenced to a punishment regarding those assets in [ the NORP court ] . Concealing these assets in the enforcement proceedings was not a part of the offence of which [ the applicant ] had already been convicted in GPE . Nor did the matter concern moneys illegally in the possession of [ the applicant ] or [ a co - defendant ] . A policeman had been present at the enforcement inquiry because he had escorted the applicant thereto . [ The applicant \u2019s ] rights under LAW had thus not been breached in that occasion . \u201d", "On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction , endorsing the lower court \u2019s reasoning in the main part . In addition , it convicted the applicant of CARDINAL registration offences and CARDINAL counts of instigation to registration offences . CARDINAL of the erroneous register entries on the basis of which the applicant was convicted concerned the Opel , the same car which the applicant , according to the courts , ought to have accounted for in the enforcement inquiry . The court increased the applicant \u2019s sentence to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . His liability in damages was also increased to some ORG CARDINAL . The court accepted ORG view regarding the applicant \u2019s allegation concerning the alleged self - incrimination .", "On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "An enforcement inquiry is resorted to if it has not been possible to establish otherwise the debtor \u2019s financial situation in a reliable manner .

The provision concerning restrictions ( now LAW ) was also amended in that connection to cover all the offences referred to in that Chapter . It now stated specifically that a person who had committed the offence by which the property was obtained or profit was gained , was not to be convicted pursuant to LAW of LAW .
