Russo;N. Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr Quaranta , who is an NORP national , was born in DATE at GPE ( GPE ) . He arrived in GPE at a very young age , with his parents . He resides at Vevey in GPE , where he pursues the occupation of assistant plumber .", "CARDINAL . DATE he was placed in various homes for juveniles . In DATE he was made the subject of an educational assistance order by decision of the President of ORG . On his return to his GPE home , he began , in DATE , a plumber \u2019s apprenticeship but failed to complete it . He subsequently worked for a number of local companies .", "On DATE ORG gave him a suspended sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , with DATE probation , for aggravated theft , robbery , criminal damage and taking and driving away a motor vehicle without a driving licence . The court decided to treat him on the same footing as his accomplice and accepted his plea of diminished responsibility ( LAW ) , but without ordering an expert psychiatric opinion ; it also took into consideration his youth , the short duration of his criminal activity , his personal situation at the time of the offences , particularly as regards his emotional insecurity , and the lasting improvement observed in his behaviour . This decision is not here in issue .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who was suspected of an offence under ORG of DATE ( \" LAW \" ) , appeared on DATE before the investigating judge ( \" juge informateur \" ) of the Vevey - Lavaux district . In the course of this sole examination , he requested free legal assistance ( LAW paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "On DATE the investigating judge communicated the application to the President of ORG who rejected it ( LAW paragraph CARDINAL below ) on DATE on the grounds that \" the needs of the defence [ did ] not require ... the provision of free legal assistance \" and that \" the case [ did ] not give rise to particular difficulties \" . Mr Quaranta was informed of this decision on DATE and , although advised of his right to appeal against it within DATE to the indictments tribunal , he did not do so .", "On DATE he went to ORG to reiterate his request . By a letter of DATE the registrar informed him that he could not lodge such a request until his file had reached the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge committed the applicant for trial in ORG , charged with offences under Articles CARDINAL para . CARDINAL , CARDINALrd , CARDINALth and CARDINALth indents , and DATE ( a ) para . CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant repeated his request for free legal assistance , but on DATE the President of ORG refused it for the same reasons as on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The hearing began on CARDINAL DATE at TIME ; it lasted TIME . The applicant appeared in person without the assistance of a lawyer . No representative of the public prosecutor \u2019s office participated in the court proceedings . The main documents in the file were read out , including the committal order . Mr Quaranta answered the President \u2019s questions and added a few words in his defence .", "DATE , after having deliberated , the court found the applicant guilty of taking drugs and drug trafficking and on this account sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ; the sentence was not suspended . In addition , having stressed the relative seriousness of the offences , committed while on probation under the DATE decision , it revoked the suspension order ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ) and ordered the activation of the previous sentence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , from which DATE that the accused had spent in detention on remand were to be deducted .", "In the grounds of the judgment the court noted that the applicant had taken hashish DATE since DATE and that from DATE he had bought , in small quantities , QUANTITY of this drug , most of which he had sold . It considered that a heavy penalty was called for because of the large quantity of hashish involved and the applicant \u2019s profit - making intention . However , in mitigation , it took into account his \" very precarious \" financial position during the period in question ; he was unemployed and he lived , together with his family , on social security benefit .", "CARDINAL . Through a lawyer , whose services he paid for himself , Mr Quaranta appealed to ORG of ORG .", "He pleaded primarily that the court should quash the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . In his view , his youth , his lack of vocational training and his CARDINAL previous convictions ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had made the presence of a lawyer necessary for his defence . Furthermore , the contested decision was , he claimed , flawed by reason of the criminal court \u2019s failure to state why it had considered that the subjective conditions for suspending the sentence were not satisfied .", "In the alternative the applicant asked ORG to vary the decision . He argued that the trial court had misapplied LAW inasmuch as , on account of his age and the improvement observed in his behaviour , he should have been left a last chance and been given a further suspended sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on the following grounds :", "\" Application to have the decision quashed ( recours en nullit\u00e9 )", "...", "In a judgment , PERSON , of CARDINAL DATE ... ORG of ORG laid down the following principles :", "The conditions set forth in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ORG [ Code of Criminal Procedure ] - the needs of the defence in a criminal prosecution - are the same as those laid down in the case - law concerning the right to free legal assistance as it may be inferred from LAW . The accused must be provided with defence counsel where the sentence which he may expect on conviction can not be suspended because of its length , or where there is a likelihood of an order confining him to a non - penal institution [ mesure privative de libert\u00e9 ] ; in other cases such a right may be recognised under LAW only where , in addition to the relative seriousness of the case , there are special difficulties from the point of view of the establishment of the facts or the legal issues raised ; it is then necessary to take account of the accused \u2019s capacities , his experience in the legal field and the measures which appear necessary , in the specific case , to provide for his defence , in particular as regards the evidence which he will have to produce .", "...", "In this instance , the length of the term of imprisonment did not in itself rule out the possibility of a suspended sentence . Moreover , the appellant does not claim that free legal assistance was necessary because he expected to receive a sentence which could not be suspended by reason of its length ; there was no difficulty in the establishment of the facts , which , as the appellant states in his memorial , \u2018 are admitted in their large NORP ; nor does the appellant rely on legal difficulties , and he is correct in not doing so ; as regards the reasons relating to the accused \u2019s personal situation , the fact that he is a young adult within the meaning of ORG CARDINAL ter of FAC , and has already been convicted , can not be regarded as constituting a particular difficulty .", "The submission is therefore unfounded and must fail .", "...", "In so far as the appellant seeks to show that the decision was flawed with regard to points of fact which constituted the basis of the reasoning of the first - instance court in its refusal to suspend the sentence , it may be accepted that this submission raises a question of nullity . But it is unfounded . In fact , in order to establish whether the subjective conditions for suspending a sentence are satisfied , the trial judge must determine whether there are prospects for the defendant \u2019s lasting improvement , having regard to his past history and his character ( PERSON du Tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral , [ ORG , official reports of the judgments of ORG ] CARDINAL IV CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL ; ORG : PERSON , DATE , ad PERSON . : CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) . In this instance the trial court noted the appellant \u2019s past history and found that he took and trafficked in drugs . As regards his character , it described his curriculum vitae , his family situation , his reputation and his financial position . The trial court therefore gathered together all the necessary information to make a prognosis . Consequently , the complaint that the decision was flawed in this respect is unfounded and the application to have the decision quashed must fail .", "...", "CARDINAL . Application to have the decision varied ( recours en r\u00e9forme )", "...", "Tribunaux [ ORG , ORG ] DATE I CARDINAL no . CARDINAL , and the judgments mentioned therein ) . The same principles have been laid down by this Court : the appellate body should intervene only where the trial court misuses its power of assessment or where it has failed to give expressly or impliedly the grounds for its decision ( see ORG with annotations , LAW , p. CARDINAL ) .", "In this instance , the grounds for refusing to suspend the sentence were stated by implication and did not constitute misuse of the power of assessment . The quantity of drugs involved was large and the appellant \u2019s criminal activity continued over a long period , while he was on probation under another sentence . The profit - making purpose is clear . Not even his precarious financial position excuses engaging in such traffic . The information obtained regarding the appellant is not wholly positive . The refusal to suspend the sentence is therefore justified and the application to have the decision varied must therefore also fail . \"", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a public - law appeal with ORG , complaining of the arbitrary application of LAW and of violations of LAW CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( c ) ( article DATE ) of the Convention . He also sought free legal assistance in the proceedings before ORG .", "On DATE ORG allowed his request for free legal assistance , but dismissed the appeal in the following terms :", "\" CARDINAL . The appellant states that the submissions on which he relies ... overlap for the most part and he gives no specific grounds , as required under LAW para . CARDINAL ( b ) OJ [ Federal Act on the organisation of the courts of DATE ] , concerning the complaint of a violation of ORG . Moreover , the guarantees secured by the provisions of LAW are in part already contained in LAW . They do not therefore in this case have separate effect ( ORG CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL , ground f , CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL ) . The present appeal can consequently be examined only from the point of view of domestic law .", "...", "... In other words provision of free legal assistance is indispensable where the case in question is of some gravity and gives rise to difficulties as to the facts or to the law of a kind that the accused is not in a position to deal with ( ORG CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL s. , ground CARDINAL c , CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL et seq . ) . In order to ascertain whether the minimum requirements of LAW are satisfied , it is necessary in each case to assess all the specific circumstances ( ORG CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ( a ) As far as the length of the likely sentence is concerned ( an order of confinement in a non - penal institution not being relevant to the present case ) , the appellant does not claim that he risked , in the given circumstances and for the only offences of which he was accused , a sentence whose length was in excess of a sentence which might be suspended . Clearly the risk of the activation of the previous suspended sentence ( which was here for a term of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ) has to be taken into account ( see the PERSON judgment , cited above , ground CARDINAL b ) . But the appellant does not maintain that , in view of this possibility , he in fact risked a custodial sentence of DATE . On the contrary , he relied on the total of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment imposed on him in order to argue that free legal assistance might have made it possible for him to obtain a more lenient sentence . It must therefore be recognised that the overall sentence which he actually risked did not exceed DATE and therefore did not entail the obligation to grant him free legal assistance .", "( b ) Evidently , the appellant \u2019s case must be regarded in itself as relatively serious , for the reasons set out in the judgments of ORG and ORG . However , various considerations which the case - law has identified as militating in favour of according free legal assistance did not apply : ORG was not in detention on remand for a long time , which would have been an impediment to his defence ; he was released on DATE on which he had been arrested ( ORG CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL e , CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ; the prosecution case was not argued , at the trial hearing on DATE , by a representative of the public prosecutor \u2019s office ( ORG CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL b , CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL i. f. ) ; despite a certain instability , the appellant did not appear to be a man of diminished capacity either physically or mentally , as can be inferred from the attestation and the statements of his employer , as well as those of the social worker questioned by the police . In addition , his case did not give rise to any difficulty as to the facts , since the investigation concerning him consisted merely of a single interview by the investigating judge . Moreover , he immediately admitted the facts in respect of which he was accused , and which are not in any case contested in the appeal ( ORG CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL , CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL ) .", "...", "( aa ) As regards the possibility of diminished criminal responsibility , the appellant relies , in the first place , on the extract from the contested judgment in which it is stated that \u2018 from DATE until DATE , and with greater frequency since DATE , the accused has taken hashish on a DATE basis\u2019 , an extract reproduced verbatim from the first - instance judgment of CARDINAL DATE . Secondly , he relies on the Conconi judgment ( ORG CARDINAL IV CARDINAL et seq . ) . It appears , however , from the file of the investigating judge of the LOC district that the above - mentioned statement of fact is not accurate . Questioned on DATE by the police , the appellant stated : \u2018 I have been smoking hash for DATE . For DATE I have smoked every day\u2019 . The same day , he answered the investigating judge as follows : \u2018 I first came into contact with hashish at DATE ... . Since then I have smoked it from time to time ; it is really only over DATE that I have been smoking hashish almost daily\u2019 . The police report of DATE notes that ORG \u2018 stated that he had been smoking hashish for DATE and more regularly for DATE . There is no evidence to the effect that , contrary to his statements , the appellant smoked hashish on a DATE basis \u2018 from DATE onwards\u2019 , or indeed that he has in fact smoked DATE since DATE . Moreover , the same evidence makes clear that he only used hashish , and not \u2018 hard\u2019 drugs . In any event the committal order and the criminal court \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE concerned solely hashish .", "On issues of law it was unnecessary to appoint a lawyer to act for the appellant in order to draw the ORG \u2019s attention to the fact that , in accordance with the Conconi judgment , \u2018 the court has a duty , where consumption of narcotics is involved , to consider whether the circumstances cast doubt on the accused \u2019s responsibility\u2019 . Quaranta appeared in no way disturbed and , unlike Conconi , he had never used \u2018 hard\u2019 drugs . The cantonal courts , which inquired into the accused \u2019s character and expressed their views in this respect , therefore clearly considered that there were no grounds for doubting his mental state . Whether or not they were under an obligation to say so expressly in their judgments , as would seem to be a possible inference from the Conconi judgment , is immaterial in relation to an alleged obligation to accord free legal assistance .", "( bb ) The question whether the reason for the refusal to suspend the new sentence also necessarily entailed the activation of the previous suspended sentence ( cf . ORG CARDINAL IV CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) was not in itself a complex legal issue which required the granting of free legal assistance . Given the appellant \u2019s previous history and the nature and the dates of the new offences , there is no evidence that the provision of legal assistance - which ORG moreover received for his appeal to ORG - would have been necessary for the protection of his rights .", "... . \"", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Quaranta went to the prison of GPE ( GPE ) to serve his sentence , but ORG of GPE accorded him a partial pardon by a decree of CARDINAL DATE which was worded as follows :", "\" The enforcement of the sentences of ten months\u2019 imprisonment , DATE of detention on remand , and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment to which ORG was sentenced by ORG respectively on CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE shall be suspended as from DATE for DATE from the date of suspension . \"", "CARDINAL .
