ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 11 - Freedom of assembly and association (Article 11-1 - Freedom of association);Respondent State to take individual measures (Article 46-2 - Individual measures);Non-pecuniary damage - award (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction)", "JUDGES": "Luzius Wildhaber;Nicolas Bratza;Paul Mahoney", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( in the province of GPE ) . He is a judge .", "CARDINAL . At the time he lodged the application , he was acting president of ORG . On DATE , following an inquiry by ORG for ORG , the Minister of ORG instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant on account of his membership of a ORG lodge affiliated to ORG di PERSON . The Minister accused him of having been a PERSON from DATE until DATE and of having thereby breached LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , the disciplinary section of ORG ( Consiglio Superiore della Magistratura ) found that the applicant had committed the offences of which he was accused and gave him a reprimand ( censura ) . It stated that from DATE onwards it should have been possible to \u201c have a clear idea of the loss of integrity resulting from membership of the NORP ... because of the degeneration brought about when a number of people came together within the PCARDINAL lodge with plans to take control of the public authorities and subvert democratic institutions , and because of the collusion of certain ORG lodges with the ORG and organised crime \u201d . The disciplinary section added that the directives issued by ORG on DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , which emphasised \u2013 the second one in particular \u2013 the substantial conflict between membership of the NORP and membership of the judiciary , were to be seen in the context of such developments . The decision also stated that it was contrary to disciplinary rules for a judge to be a PERSON , for the following reasons : the incompatibility between the ORG and judicial oaths , the hierarchical relationship between NORP , the \u201c rejection \u201d of ORG justice in favour of ORG \u201c justice \u201d and , lastly , the indissoluble nature of the bond between NORP , even in the case of a member who wished to leave the organisation .", "The disciplinary section of ORG stated , lastly , that the applicant 's alleged ignorance of the institutional debate on PERSON merely served to confirm the existence of conduct punishable under LAW . In its opinion , such conduct was characterised by a lack of diligence , caution and wisdom in dealing with a situation that posed a threat to the values protected by that Article .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law to ORG . In the CARDINAL grounds of his appeal he alleged a breach of LAW , challenged the arguments used in support of the finding that judicial office was incompatible with membership of the NORP , and complained that no reasons had been given for the conclusion that a judge would be discredited by belonging to the NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged a cross - appeal . ORG , sitting as a full court , examined the case on DATE and , in a judgment of DATE , dismissed the applicant 's appeal .", "It held , firstly , that the application of LAW was limited by the constitutional principles of the impartiality and independence of the judiciary , principles which should be taken to prevail over the right to freedom of association . ORG further held that the disciplinary section of ORG had based its decision mainly on the directive of DATE in which the ORG had emphasised that judicial office was incompatible with membership of the Freemasons .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintains that his career has been at a standstill since the disciplinary section 's decision : he was declared unsuitable for a post as judge of ORG ; furthermore , the judicial council for his district stated that , because of the reprimand , it was unable to give an opinion on his suitability for a post as president of a district court .", "Lastly , the applicant states that he has been transferred to GPE ; however , he has not produced any evidence that that decision was linked to the sanction imposed on him .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the LAW are the following :", "\u201c ORG may form associations freely , without authorisation , for purposes not prohibited for individuals by the criminal law .", "Secret associations and associations pursuing , even indirectly , a political aim through organisations of a military nature shall be prohibited . \u201d", "\u201c No one shall be removed from the jurisdiction of a lawfully established court .", "No one shall be punished save in accordance with a law in force at the time when the offence was committed .", "No one shall be subjected to security measures except in cases provided for by law . \u201d", "\u201c All citizens shall have the duty to be loyal to the Republic and to comply with the LAW and the laws .", "ORG to whom public offices are entrusted shall perform them with discipline and honour , and take an oath where it is required by law . \u201d", "\u201c Public officials shall be at the exclusive service of the nation .", "If they are members of ORG they shall be promoted only by seniority .", "The right to become members of political parties may be limited by law in the case of members of the judiciary , professional members of the armed forces on active duty , police officials and officers , and diplomatic and consular representatives abroad . \u201d", "\u201c Justice shall be administered in the name of the people . Judges shall be beholden only to the law . \u201d", "\u201c Reasons shall be stated for all judicial decisions .", "An appeal on points of law to ORG for a breach of the law shall always be allowed against judgments and measures concerning personal freedom delivered by the ordinary or special courts . This provision may be waived only in the case of sentences pronounced by military courts in time of war .", "Appeals to ORG against decisions of the PERSON and ORG shall be allowed only on grounds pertaining to jurisdiction . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Royal Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c the DATE decree \u201d ) concerns the safeguards afforded to members of the ORG legal service ( guarentigie della magistratura ) .", "Article CARDINAL of the decree provides that any judge who \u201c fails to fulfil his obligations or behaves , in the performance of his duties or otherwise , in a manner which makes him unworthy of the trust and consideration which he must enjoy or which undermines the prestige of the judiciary \u201d will incur a disciplinary sanction .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court , when asked to give a ruling as to whether LAW decree was compatible with LAW , held that , in disciplinary proceedings against judges , the principle of lawfulness applied as a fundamental requirement of the rule of law and was a necessary consequence of the role conferred on the judiciary by LAW ( judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "However , with regard to the fact that DATE did not specify the types of conduct which might be regarded as unlawful , ORG pointed out that it was not possible to give examples of every type of conduct which might undermine the values guaranteed by that provision : the trust and consideration which a judge must enjoy and the prestige of the judiciary . It considered that those values amounted to principles of professional conduct which could not be included in \u201c guidelines laid down in advance , because it [ was ] not possible to identify and classify every example of reprehensible conduct which might provoke a negative reaction in society \u201d ( ibid . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . ORG subsequently reiterated that the earlier laws governing the same subject matter had included a provision of general scope alongside the provisions penalising specific conduct , that the proposals for reform in this field had always been worded in general terms and that the same was true for other professional categories . It concluded : \u201c The provisions in this area can not but be of general scope because specific guidelines would have the effect of legitimising types of conduct which were not expressly mentioned , but which nonetheless attracted society 's opprobrium . \u201d It added that those considerations justified the broad scope of the rule and the wide margin of appreciation conferred on a body which , acting within the guarantees inherent in any judicial procedure , was DATE by virtue of its composition \u2013 particularly well qualified to assess whether the conduct considered in each case did or did not undermine the protected values ( ibid . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "ORG considered , lastly , that such an interpretation was consistent with its case - law on the subject of lawfulness ( ibid . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . It stated that , as it had previously held , \u201c the principle of lawfulness [ was ] applicable not only by means of a rigorous and exhaustive description of individual cases , but sometimes also through the use of expressions that are sufficient to determine the rule with certainty and to ascertain whether a particular type of conduct has breached the principle \u201d .", "It further held : \u201c ' open - ended ' provisions which penalise unlawful types of conduct by reference to concepts based on common experience or objectively understandable ethical and social values are fully compatible with the principle of lawfulness . \u201d", "ORG added that , with regard to the provisions in issue , such interpretation criteria appeared more valid in a disciplinary context because , in comparison with criminal offences , disciplinary offences aroused less of a reaction in society and had less of an impact on the personal situation of the individual concerned , and also because the possibility of conduct undermining the protected values was greater than in the case of criminal offences .", "It further stated that the reference in DATE to the trust and consideration which a judge must enjoy and to the prestige of the judiciary was not objectionable as those concepts could be determined according to general opinion .", "Accordingly , ORG held that the constitutional provisions in issue had not been infringed , since there had been no breach of the principles of lawfulness and of the independence of the judiciary .", "CARDINAL . Law no . CARDINAL of DATE contains provisions on the implementation of LAW ( right of association ) in respect of secret associations and on the dissolution of the \u201c PCARDINAL \u201d lodge . Section CARDINAL provides that membership of a secret association is a criminal offence .", "With regard to civil servants , section CARDINAL provides that disciplinary proceedings must also be brought against them before a special committee constituted according to very precise rules . However , where judges of the ordinary , administrative and military courts are concerned , jurisdiction is vested in the relevant disciplinary bodies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a directive after holding a debate \u2013 further to a message from the Head of ORG , who acts as its president DATE on the incompatibility of judicial office with membership of the NORP . The proceedings of that meeting ( the debate and the text of the directive ) were published in the Official Bulletin ( PERSON consiliari , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) under the heading \u201c Report on the incompatibility of judicial office with membership of the NORP \u201d . An introductory note states that the report was compiled by ORG . A copy of the report was sent to the President of GPE and the speakers of the ORG and ORG .", "According to the directive , \u201c judges ' membership of associations imposing a particularly strong hierarchical and mutual bond through the establishment , by solemn oaths , of bonds such as those required by ORG lodges raises delicate problems as regards observance of the values enshrined in LAW \u201d .", "ORG added that it was \u201c undoubtedly [ within its ] powers to verify compliance with the fundamental principle of LAW , according to which ' judges are beholden only to the law ' \u201d . It continued : \u201c this scrutiny entails ... taking care to ensure that , in discharging their duties , all judges respect \u2013 and are seen to respect \u2013 the principle of being beholden to the law alone . \u201d", "ORG then referred to ORG judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , in which judges ' freedom of thought had been weighed against their obligation to be impartial and independent ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "It added : \u201c it has to be stressed that among the types of conduct of a judge to be taken into consideration for the requirements of the exercise of the administrative activity peculiar to the ORG , there is also , beyond the limit laid down by PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] , the acceptance of constraints which ( a ) are superimposed on the obligation of loyalty to LAW and of impartial and independent exercise of judicial activity and ( b ) undermine the confidence of citizens in the judiciary by causing it to lose its credibility . \u201d", "Lastly , ORG considered it necessary \u201c to suggest to the Minister of Justice that consideration be given to the advisability of proposing restrictions on judges ' freedom of association , to include a reference to all associations which \u2013 on account of their organisation and ends \u2013 entail for their members particularly strong bonds of hierarchy and solidarity \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a further directive .", "It stated that the question whether membership of the NORP was compatible with judicial office had hitherto given rise solely to considerations concerning judges ' career development and access to positions of leadership . Following criticism from certain political figures , including the NORP President , to the effect that such an approach was unconstitutional , it had proved necessary to clarify the matter from a legal point of view .", "Referring to judges ' duties of loyalty and obedience , and having pointed out that the freedom of association for the purpose of professing ORG ideas was not being called into question on a general level , ORG emphasised , however , that the performance of judicial duties was incompatible with membership of the NORP in GPE on account of the association 's secret nature and the means of action and aims of the country 's ORG lodges ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
