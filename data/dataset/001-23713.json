AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national , who lives in PERSON ( GPE ) . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE ( GPE ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant bought a plot of land , designated in the area zoning plan as agricultural land , in GPE , PERSON . He had the intention to build a hotel on that land .", "In DATE the GPE adopted an area zoning plan ( GPE ) in which the applicant \u2019s land was designated as building plot ( Bauland ) .", "On DATE the applicant filed a request for a building permit for a hotel with CARDINAL beds and a restaurant .", "On DATE the mayor of ORG held a hearing . A land use planning expert commented on the project by stating that the applicant \u2019s plot of land was situated in a completely unspoilt area between CARDINAL built - up areas of GPE and that in his view a project of this size was not desirable .", "On DATE the GPE issued a building prohibition for the area in which the applicant \u2019s land was situated .", "On DATE the mayor held another hearing .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a building permit on the ground that the project would have been contrary to the objectives of the building prohibition , that the water supply and sewage disposal were not ensured for the land and that the project , if realised , would alter the characteristics of the village and the landscape ( Orts- PERSON ) . Moreover , it found that each of these reasons was sufficient in itself to dismiss the applicant \u2019s request .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal . He complained that ORG reasoning was insufficient and inconclusive .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It based this decision merely on the finding that his request was contrary to the building prohibition .", "The applicant filed a complaint with ORG as well as with ORG , claiming that the building prohibition was unlawful .", "On DATE ORG refused to deal with the applicant \u2019s complaint for lack of prospects of success .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint . It found that the building prohibition was lawful and that , therefore , the dismissal of the applicant \u2019s application for a planning permission was equally lawful .", "Subsequently , the GPE opened proceedings for the modification of the area zoning plan .", "On DATE ORG issued a new area zoning plan under which the applicant \u2019s land was designated as undeveloped land ( PERSON ) on which the owner was not allowed to construct buildings .", "On DATE the applicant filed a new application for a planning permission for his project in order to challenge the modification of the area zoning plan .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application on the ground that it conflicted with the area zoning plan .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal of CARDINAL DATE and confirmed the decision .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . He submitted that the modification of the area zoning plan had been unlawful and that the planning permission , therefore , should have been granted . He also complained that his right to property had been violated .", "On DATE ORG refused to deal with the complaint for lack of prospects of success . Consequently , ORG referred the case to ORG .", "On DATE the applicant supplemented his complaint pending before ORG . He submitted that the modification of the area zoning plan was unlawful . He requested a hearing and to carry out an inspection of the location .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint . It considered that it was unnecessary to institute proceedings with ORG to examine the area zoning plan , as that court had already refused to deal with the case for lack of prospects of success . It found that there was no doubt that the modification of the area zoning plan was lawful . It dismissed the requests for a hearing and an inspection of the location , as the case merely concerned questions of law . This decision was served on DATE .", "In NORP administrative law CARDINAL distinguishes decrees ( Verordnung ) and ( individual ) decisions ( Bescheid ) . Decisions of administrative authorities are addressed to individuals and can be challenged by way of appeal ( GPE ) under LAW of ORG ) . Final administrative decisions may be challenged by way of complaints with ORG under LAW and complaints with ORG under LAW .", "In contrast , decrees are addressed to the general public . The lawfulness of decrees can only be reviewed by ORG . If it is possible to institute administrative proceedings in which the allegedly unlawful decree applies , the question of its lawfulness can be brought before ORG by a constitutional complaint under LAW , or by a request made by ORG , an ORG or an ordinary court under LAW . In exceptional circumstances a person who is affected by a decree may seize ORG with an independent request for review of the lawfulness of a decree , namely , if the decree has direct consequences on the situation of the person without it being necessary that an administrative decision be taken .", "The ORG examines whether there has been any infringement of an applicant \u2019s right under the LAW and whether any decree unauthorised by statute law or any unconstitutional statute or international treaty unlawful under NORP law has been applied ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "In PERSON land planning use is governed by ORG ( Raumplanungsgesetz ) . Area zoning plans and any amendments thereto are regarded as decrees . The proceedings in which they are issued are not ordinary administrative proceedings and the persons affected are not parties to them .", "The competent local authorities ( NORP ) must take into consideration principles of sustainable land planning use as well as planning proceedings of neighbouring local authorities and other public law corporations ( Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "If the area zoning plan is the basis for the granting or withholding of building permits , the persons affected are expected to assert their rights in administrative proceedings concerning the building permit , in which they can allege that the underlying area zoning plan has no legal basis or is contrary to the applicable legislation .", "According to LAW , that court is to hold a hearing after its preliminary investigation of the case where a complainant has requested a hearing within the time - limit . LAW ( CARDINAL ) , which was added to the LAW in DATE , provides however that , notwithstanding a party \u2019s application , ORG may decide not to hold a hearing if it is apparent from the written pleadings of the parties and the files relating to the previous proceedings , that an oral hearing is not likely to contribute to the clarification of the case .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW reads as follows :", "\" ORG may ... decline to accept a case for adjudication if it does not have sufficient prospects of success or if it can not be expected that the judgment will clarify an issue of constitutional law . The ORG may not decline to accept for adjudication a case excluded from the jurisdiction of ORG by Article CARDINAL . \""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
