He spent certain periods of time in the GPE detainee hospital . He was convicted of a number of crimes but is still remanded on other charges .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the conditions of detention were inhuman . In particular , he referred to the overcrowding in the cells ( which occasionally meant CARDINAL detainees for each CARDINAL of space ) , accompanied by the fact that detainees with infectious diseases such as tuberculosis were kept together with other detainees , especially during hunger - strikes ; the presence of parasitic insects ; the lack of proper ventilation and access to daylight ; the rudimentary sanitary conditions which left no room for privacy ; the loud radio that was constantly on TIME together with the very poor quantity and quality of food served . Before CARDINAL DATE electricity and cold water were only available for TIME a day . The applicant described his food ration for DATE as consisting of QUANTITY of porridge with water twice a day and a soup consisting mostly of water for lunch , with QUANTITY of bread for DATE . In support of his complaint regarding the overcrowding in the cell he gave the example of his transfer to cell no . CARDINAL on DATE , which he shared with CARDINAL other persons despite the fact that CARDINAL bunk beds were available . He claimed that he had to sleep on the floor due to the insufficiency of beds and had access only to electric light for TIME a day . Another example was his detention in cell no .

In its letter of DATE ORG conceded that prison no . CARDINAL was \u201c periodically overcrowded \u201d , which led to an increase in the spread of pediculosis and skin disease .

In DATE a major disinfection had been carried out in the prison .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter to the prison administration dated DATE the applicant complained about the absence of beds in cell no .

In a letter to another person detained in the same cell , no . CARDINAL , dated DATE , ORG stated that \u201c all the persons detained in that cell have a bed and bed linen \u201d . The video recording submitted by the Government showed CARDINAL bunk beds in the cell , CARDINAL of which was placed across the toilet . According to the Government , electricity and cold water were permanently available and there was natural light in each cell . The applicant had the right to a bath DATE . Food was given in accordance with the relevant Government regulations , including meat and fish \u201c depending on availability \u201d .

The applicant began a hunger - strike on DATE as a result of alleged violations of his rights and those of his family . Since no prosecutor came to discuss with him the alleged violations for DATE , on TIME DATE he cut his wrists and set fire to himself . He was treated and was subsequently force - fed a number of times .

The applicant wrote that he had requested to be given food intra - venously rather than by means of a stomach tube .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE the applicant underwent in - patient treatment after he had been diagnosed , inter alia , with mosaic psychopathy .", "CARDINAL . In an answer to the applicant 's lawyer , the prison administration confirmed that on DATE the applicant had begun a hunger - strike and was given a medical examination DATE . On DATE he cut his veins and set fire to himself and was treated immediately . On CARDINAL DATE the doctor found his state of health relatively satisfactory . On CARDINAL DATE a doctor found that the applicant 's health was deteriorating and ordered force - feeding .

On DATE the applicant was transferred to a detainee hospital and he ended his hunger - strike on DATE . The feeding took place on the basis of LAW of the PERSON on pre - trial detention ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and a special instruction ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . That instruction had not been published but it appears that the applicant had known its contents since he mentioned it in his \u201c hunger - strike diary \u201d . The prison regulation was not published either but did not contain any provision regarding force - feeding . On DATE a copy was exceptionally sent to the applicant .", "CARDINAL .

In response to the ORG 's request to submit all relevant medical documents concerning the applicant 's force - feeding , including the results of any medical tests made , the ORG submitted the following documents . Several types of medical investigations of the applicant 's health took place after DATE , including blood and urine analyses , cardiac and other measurements . According to the register of visits by the duty doctor , the applicant 's health was satisfactory during most of the period DATE DATE . On DATE the duty doctor found that the applicant 's health was \u201c relatively satisfactory \u201d but considered that he was not sufficiently fit to participate in criminal investigation actions , having complained of general weakness and dizziness . On DATE the duty doctor noted \u201c ORG - feeding was administered in accordance with the instruction ( milk CARDINALml , sugar CARDINALgr ) \u201d . Similar remarks were made on DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . On a number of these dates , the duty doctor noted that the applicant 's health had been \u201c relatively satisfactory \u201d , while on DATE it was \u201c satisfactory \u201d . No indication of the nature of the food administered was noted for the dates DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lodged a complaint about the force - feeding and about the pain and humiliation caused by that process . He described the process as follows : he was always handcuffed , even though he never physically resisted force - feeding but simply refused to take food as a form of protest . The prison staff forced him to open his mouth by pulling his hair , gripping his neck and stepping on his feet until he could no longer bear the pain and opened his mouth . His mouth was then fixed in an open position by means of a metal mouth - widener . His tongue was pulled out of his mouth with a pair of metal tongs which he claims left it numb and bleeding each time . A hard tube was inserted as far as his stomach through which liquidised food passed into his stomach provoking , on some occasions , sharp pain . When the metal holder was removed from his mouth , he bled , he could not feel his tongue and was unable to speak . The instruments used for his force - feeding were not fitted with single - use , soft protection layers to prevent pain and infection .", "CARDINAL . According to the witness statement made in court by ORG , a nurse who personally witnessed the applicant 's force - feeding , the applicant had not always resisted force - feeding and no handcuffing had been necessary on such occasions , but it was a mandatory procedure , which she considered to be painful , but necessary to save lives . ORG , a generalist who personally force - fed the applicant , declared in court that occasionally the food introduced \u201c did not correspond to the instruction \u201d .", "CARDINAL . V.B. , a detainee in the same remand centre , gave evidence in court that he had seen blood on the applicant and on other detainees after they had been force - fed . The applicant requested to be fed milk or to be given vitamins through an intra - venous drip . He also submitted copies of decisions to place him in a solitary cell for periods of DATE for hunger - strikes on DATE and DATE , DATE and DATE , QUANTITY DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE . The latter sanction mentioned that the applicant \u201c categorically continued to refuse to take food \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to examine the complaint because it did not comply with procedural requirements . On DATE that court again refused to examine his complaint on the same ground . On DATE the ORG quashed that decision and ordered a re - hearing , finding that the applicant , as a detainee , could not fully observe the formalities and that the specific nature of his complaint warranted an examination of his case on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected his claim as unfounded . It focused on the lawfulness of force - feeding and qualified his refusal to eat as a violation of detention rules . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the previous judgments and ordered a full re - hearing . The court noted that the lower courts had not established clearly whether medical necessity had been the basis for the force - feeding of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Article CARDINAL of ORG ( which had provided for the force - feeding of detainees on hunger - strike ) was amended to expressly prohibit the force - feeding of detainees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected his claims as unfounded . It found that the law ( applicable at the time ) , which provided for the force - feeding of detainees who refused to eat , was not contrary to national or international human rights standards , aiming as it did at protecting the lives of such detainees . The applicant 's force - feeding was based on medical necessity as established by the medical personnel and his handcuffing and other restrictive measures were necessary to protect him from danger to his health and life . The court found that in view of his resistance to force - feeding it was necessary to apply to him \u201c special means , including handcuffs \u201d and that it did not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment . The court did not deal with the witness statements of ORG GPE or GPE ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment , essentially repeating the reasons of ORG . The court noted that the witnesses heard by the lower court had denied having tortured the applicant and that there was no evidence to support his claim .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , relying , inter alia , on evidence of damage to his health as a result of force - feeding such as a broken tooth and an abdominal infection . He also relied on his inability to pay and mentioned his second - degree invalidity . The court refused to examine his appeal because the applicant had not paid court fees of CARDINAL NORP lei ( MDL ) ( the equivalent of CARDINAL ( ORG ) at the time ) . He requested the court to waive those fees because he had no sources of income and could not afford to pay them . The court responded by a letter of DATE , explaining that his appeal :", "\u201c does not correspond to the provisions of ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL of ORG ... According to LAW if the appeal does not correspond to the provisions of LAW or if the court fee has not been paid , the court returns it within DATE under the signature of the president or the vice - president of the court . For these reasons we return your appeal for elimination of shortcomings . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's appeal in cassation lodged with ORG in respect of his force - feeding was not examined by that court for failure to pay the court fees ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had won court proceedings in DATE and had received MDL CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE he was awarded MDL CARDINAL . However , this decision was appealed and the applicant did not receive any of that award in DATE . The applicant paid MDL CARDINAL for the assistance of a lawyer during his detention . He was also compensated for lost mail by the postal authorities of GPE and GPE ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In several letters to the domestic authorities he claimed that the court fees and his other expenses had been paid by his relatives or friends . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE he asked the prison administration to receive the compensation from the postal authorities and to transfer it to his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . The applicant initiated court proceedings requesting a court order to oblige the Government to provide him with the financial means for initiating various court proceedings . On DATE ORG dismissed this complaint for failure to follow the extra - judicial dispute settlement procedure before initiating the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submitted copies of several letters , including from ORG , letter of DATE ) , ORG ( DATE ) , ORG ( DATE ) , an PERSON ( DATE ) , a psychiatric hospital ( DATE ) as well as from law - enforcement agencies such as the prosecutor 's office ( DATE ) and non - governmental organisations such as \u201c ORG \u201d ( DATE ) and \u201c Lawyers for Human Rights \u201d ( DATE ) . Most of these letters bear prison stamps indicating the entry number and date . Occasionally , a handwritten instruction is given : \u201c to be handed [ to the applicant ] \u201d and/or by a note with his name and his cell number ( including cell CARDINAL . CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE ) . Other letters bear the stamp only on the envelope . Some of the letters were addressed to the prison administration and the applicant , but all of the letters mentioned above were addressed to the applicant only .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that except for a first visit by his family at the beginning of his detention , he communicated with them through a glass partition using an internal telephone . Such visits were limited to TIME a month and no privacy was possible since CARDINAL cabins for such visits were placed next to each other . All physical contact was excluded . Convicted persons were allowed much longer visiting times in separate meeting rooms without a glass partition . The applicant did not have such privileges because , although convicted of some offences , he was still on remand on other charges . He further stated that he had been denied visits by his family for long periods of time ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested better conditions for visits . On DATE he asked for permission to have longer visits ( see the preceding paragraph ) from his girlfriend and his sister and noted that his conviction had become final on CARDINAL DATE . This request was refused on the basis of the \u201c Statute of the remand centre \u201d .", "CARDINAL . He initiated court proceedings against the administration of the remand centre requesting the right to have better visiting conditions , notably to be able to meet his visitors in a separate room for a longer time and without the glass partition . The administration submitted that such visits were prohibited by the prison rules , which aimed at protecting the safety and order of the remand centre . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's claim .", "CARDINAL . On appeal he added a request for more regular visits and invoked the fact that he was both a convict and a detainee on remand . He stressed the long period of time during which he had not had any physical contact with relatives and described how he missed such contact , given also that he could not contact them by telephone . The applicant insisted that he had obtained on numerous occasions the agreement of the judge in charge of his case for meetings with relatives , but that the prison administration allowed meetings only in the glass cabin . He noted that occasionally the internal telephone in the glass cabin had not worked and that he had had to shout to be heard by his relatives , which was an embarrassment since CARDINAL other families had had to do the same . The applicant invoked LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG , in its final judgment of DATE , refused to examine the request for more regular visits as it had not been lodged with the first - instance court .
