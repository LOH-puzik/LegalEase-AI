The summons stated that he would be subjected to sanctions if he did not attend . On the copy of the summons submitted to this ORG was a hand - written note ( of DATE ) of a NORP criminal investigator indicating that the copy summons had been placed on the file of that investigator as evidence in a case ( No . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) against the first applicant . He did not respond to the call for military service and claimed before this ORG that this was because of his religion .", "By summons dated DATE and issued by the NORP authorities , the first applicant was required to attend the office of a criminal investigator on DATE on the basis of a suspected breach of LAW ( failure to present for military service ) . A further summons was issued by the same authority for the applicant \u2019s attendance on DATE . A copy of each summons was submitted to this ORG and both had the same hand - written note from the same NORP criminal investigator .", "The first applicant claimed as follows : he attended that interview and QUANTITY police entered the room and beat him violently with a stool . They told him that he would be prosecuted for failing to report for military service . His arm was fractured and he had injuries to his back . He immediately left GPE for GPE where he was assisted by other GPE \u2019s Witnesses . He was obliged to make a report to the police in GPE about his injuries before he could get medical treatment . He obtained the report and then the medical treatment . He submitted to this Court a \u201c legal - medical \u201d report of a doctor assigned by the NORP police : it was stamped by ORG and dated DATE . Its stated purpose was to examine how the injuries had been caused . Reference was made to a \u201c dislocation of his right arm near the elbow \u201d and to \u201c contusion on the left leg \u201d . The first applicant claimed that this report put the NORP authorities on notice that he had avoided military service in GPE .", "On DATE the NORP authorities published a \u201c search order \u201d including a photograph and description of the physical characteristics of the first applicant noting that he was accused of offences under , it appears , Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Moldovan Criminal Code ( avoidance of military service ) . The same hand - written note of the NORP criminal investigator was on the copy of that order submitted to this ORG . By summons dated DATE and issued by the NORP authorities , the first applicant was requested to attend on DATE before a NORP criminal investigator in connection with LAW ( concerning avoidance of military service ) .", "By judgment dated DATE of ORG ( in Case No . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) the first applicant was found guilty of a breach of ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Moldovan Criminal Code . The reasons were noted as follows :", "\u2013 the first applicant had breached the law on military service in force on all of the territory of GPE . Indeed he had recognised that he was a deserter ;", "\u2013 by virtue of the agreement between the authorities of GPE and GPE , everyone charged with offences committed on the territory of GPE or of GPE and who finds himself within the jurisdiction of one of the parties to that agreement , must be extradited to the authorities seized of the relevant investigation ;", "\u2013 There was no reason requiring the applicant \u2019s recognition as a refugee in GPE as there was no risk of persecution in GPE because of his political or religious opinions . In addition , there was no possibility of an alternative to military service in GPE .", "\u2013 Accordingly , the first applicant was to be extradited to GPE to the relevant authorities seized of the investigation there . The date of the extradition would be established by further decision of that court and the first applicant was to be informed by summons . He was required to be present when the date of extradition would be handed down .", "By summons dated DATE a ORG required the first applicant \u2019s attendance on DATE . He did not appear and a search order was issued for him on DATE by ORG citing Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Moldovan Criminal Code . His photograph was included as well as a description of his physical characteristics . In DATE and DATE the NORP authorities also issued CARDINAL witness summons to the first applicant \u2019s former employer in GPE to attend the criminal investigator on DATE and on DATE . Copies of all CARDINAL summonses were placed on the Moldovan authorities\u2019 investigation file concerning the first applicant .", "The second applicant claimed she had been a GPE \u2019s Witness since DATE . It appears that in DATE she had a child ( PERSON ) : no complaint to ORG was made by him or on his behalf . The second applicant met the first applicant at a GPE \u2019s Witness meeting in DATE in GPE . She did not accompany the first applicant when he left for GPE in DATE although she visited him on a number of occasions in GPE .", "She claimed that she was summonsed to appear CARDINAL times before a criminal investigator in GPE ( DATE and DATE ) . She attended on each occasion . She believed that the NORP police knew that she had contact with the first applicant and therefore maintained pressure on her . Initially they questioned her as a witness , requiring information about the first applicant . They then began to threaten to charge her with a criminal offence . They had searched her flat on a number of occasions during DATE . In DATE they searched her flat and found some GPE \u2019s Witness literature . Accordingly , in DATE when she appeared before a criminal investigator , she claimed that the authorities took her passport , made her sign a document undertaking not to leave the country and were preparing to charge her with illegal possession of the literature . She was scared and was already pregnant with the first applicant \u2019s child . She submitted a copy of CARDINAL summons : it was difficult to decipher its date but it required her to appear before a NORP criminal investigator for questioning ( under a provision of LAW ) and to bring her passport .", "She therefore left in DATE and joined the first applicant in GPE on DATE .", "Once the first applicant received the summons from the NORP authorities of DATE , he and the second applicant left GPE .", "They travelled to GPE where they got on a truck which took them to GPE . They arrived in GPE on DATE . They applied for asylum on DATE . They completed their refugee status questionnaires ( CARDINAL and DATE , respectively ) and they were both interviewed on DATE . Reports pursuant to LAW were prepared .", "On DATE the third applicant was born in GPE and he obtained an NORP passport on DATE . The first and second applicants\u2019 consequent request for residency ( made in DATE ) has not yet been determined .", "The first applicant completed his refugee status questionnaires on DATE and was interviewed on DATE . He claimed that he was a NORP \u2019s Witness and had therefore refused military service and that he would be persecuted for his faith in GPE . On DATE the Commissioner decided not to grant refugee status , finding as follows :", "\u201c [ The first applicant ] has not demonstrated a well founded fear of persecution under a [ LAW ground . In order to qualify for refugee status [ the first applicant ] must \u201c demonstrate a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion \u201d and that he is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of his country of origin . The incidents he referred to would not have amounted to persecution ...", "In relation to the [ first ] applicant \u2019s claims it can not be doubted that FAC do experience some degree of discrimination in the NORP region of GPE and that distribution of any material in relation to this religious group is illegal . It is important then to consider that the [ first ] applicant seems to have been content to live in such an environment as previous to his problems in relation to military service he made no attempt to leave the NORP region and move to the GPE controlled part of the country where practice of the NORP Witness religion is permitted . This would seem to indicate that up to that point the [ first ] applicant certainly had not been persecuted in GPE , such would have been the opportunity for him to leave the NORP region . According to the GPE ORG report the option of internal flight clearly would have been an option to the [ first ] applicant at this time .", "[ The first applicant ] claims to have attended a court hearing at which it was decided he should be extradited to GPE . In addition , he claims to have subsequently been given a hearing date for the Spring of CARDINAL at which his extradition date to GPE was to be set . He then states that it was after receiving this notice of the second hearing that he left GPE . It is in my opinion highly doubtful if somebody up for extradition would be released until DATE for his extradition was set . It would seem most peculiar that he would not have been kept in custody until his alleged extradition , especially considering he would be such a major flight risk . \u201d", "The first applicant was informed of the recommendation of the Commissioner by letter dated DATE .", "The second applicant completed her refugee status questionnaires on DATE and was also interviewed on DATE . She indicated that the first applicant was a GPE \u2019s Witness from birth and that she was a GPE \u2019s Witness since DATE . She responded in some detail to numerous and specific questions on the GPE \u2019s Witness religion . She indicated that baptism was important but that not every GPE \u2019s Witness was baptised . She described the first applicant \u2019s failure to respond to his call to complete military service , how he was beaten by the police in GPE and how he left GPE for GPE together with the extradition proceedings there . She also described how she had been summoned to appear before a criminal investigator in GPE and the searches of her flat . She considered that it would be difficult for them to live in GPE ( inter alia , she could not speak GPE ) and if she moved to GPE she would have had to leave the first applicant . She noted that , if they returned to GPE , the authorities might leave her alone but the first applicant would be imprisoned . A report was prepared on DATE", "In DATE the second applicant was admitted to a psychiatric hospital following an overdose of antidepressant drugs she had brought from GPE . She was discharged TIME later and was referred to a mental health centre . She was there prescribed milder anti - depressant medication and a mild sedative which she took for DATE . Having requested a medical report from the centre ( concerning her capacity to participate in a hearing ) in order to obtain an adjournment of her asylum proceedings , she was informed that the practice was that the centre would issue such a certificate following an official request from the second applicant \u2019s lawyers or the relevant tribunal . She claimed that , given the difficulties in communicating and securing an appointment with the ORG , the request for such a certificate was not made and on DATE of the hearing she was advised by her legal advisers not to raise her condition or medication with the tribunal .", "On DATE the Commissioner decided not to recommend the grant of refugee status . It was noted that :", "\u201c This ongoing pressure from the police could have indeed created in the mind of the [ second ] applicant a subjective fear of persecution . The [ second ] applicant stated that she became increasingly concerned about the actions of the authorities as time went by , and felt that she might be charged with an offence when her passport was retained , and she signed an order to remain in GPE . [ The second applicant ] was additionally worried because FAC literature was found in her home when it was searched in DATE . As the applicant herself stated , ... emotions are important . ...", "Objectively , if CARDINAL examines all aspects of the [ second ] applicant \u2019s case , and the perceived persecution she faced in GPE , it is felt that even on a cumulative basis the applicant did not face what would amount to persecution , as defined by LAW , ... Additionally , it should be noted that the [ second ] applicant claims to have moved freely between the GPE region and GPE when she went to visit her partner . This point raises a question over the well - foundedness of the applicant \u2019s fear of persecution in GPE .", "An important aspect of any claim for asylum is the issue of national identity . [ The second applicant ] stated that she is NORP , and stated that she thinks her partner is GPE . Technically everyone in GPE is a citizen of [ GPE ] . The [ second ] applicant stated that her passport was confiscated ... by the GPE authorities . [ She ] did however , submit her birth certificate , which states that she was born in [ GPE ] in DATE ; importantly this certificate states that [ the second applicant \u2019s ] mother is GPE and her father is NORP .", "Examining the citizenship laws of GPE , specifically LAW , it seems that [ the second applicant ] is entitled to citizenship of [ GPE ] , and would therefore be afforded the protection of this state . [ The second applicant ] stated that she was concerned that she would not be able to live in GPE because of the language differences , and the old system of registration .", "The law of registration has changed in GPE . The authority to register individuals has been modified . It is no longer the police who issue identity documents , rather it is the responsibility of ORG , which is no longer part of ORG . Further the largest minority group in GPE is ethnic NORP . Most people , if not all , speak NORP in GPE , and evidence suggests that NORP remains an important spoken language in GPE DATE .", "Considering the above COI [ country of origin information ] , in addition to the [ second applicant \u2019s ] own remarks concerning her ethnic background , in addition to the freedom which [ the second applicant ] seemed to have when visiting her husband in [ GPE ] , overall , it is felt that [ the second applicant ] would have been able to relocate within GPE , and therefore would have effectively removed herself from the errant behaviour of the local [ NORP ] police . There is no objective evidence which would suggest that [ the second applicant ] could not have found protection and safety in [ GPE ] had she sought it . \u201d", "The Commissioner concluded , in rejecting her application for asylum :", "\u201c [ The second applicant ] is claiming asylum because of her imputed political opinion . There is a considerable amount of ORG which states that the option of alternative service does not exist and that objection to military service for reasons of religious conscience is not respected in the NORP state . Additionally , there is evidence which shows that the authorities of the NORP region do discriminate against members of the NORP \u2019s ORG .", "Refugee status as defined by LAW is reserved for those persons who are in need of international protection . Considering all aspects of the [ second applicant \u2019s ] claim DATE the alleged persecution which [ the second applicant ] experienced , and the option for [ the second applicant ] to relocate to [ GPE ] , it is felt that the applicant does not meet the provisions of the DATE LAW needed to be declared a refugee . \u201d", "The second applicant was informed of the recommendation of the Commissioner by letter dated DATE .", "Both appealed against the recommendation on the basis of notices of appeal prepared by counsel instructed by ORG ( ORG ) .", "On DATE ORG ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) decided to uphold the recommendation of the Commissioner and to reject their appeal ( the applicants were legally represented ) . The first applicant maintained his asylum claim on the basis of his avoidance of military service in GPE and his religion . The second applicant \u2019s request for asylum was based on the NORP authorities\u2019 prosecution of her concerning the GPE \u2019s Witness material found in her home . The ORG found as follows :", "\u201c The applicants in this matter base their claim for refugee status on persecution because of their religious beliefs . ...", "The first ... applicant stated that he fled GPE and went to GPE because he received his call up papers to do his military service . He stated that he did not wish to complete his military service because he had been a member of ORG since DATE .", "On the basis of his answers in relation to his membership , particularly in relation to the date of birth of PERSON ( which he stated was DATE , when ORG deem it to be DATE ) , I am not persuaded that the applicant is a member of ORG .", "The applicant was asked if he had received sacraments as a member of the GPE \u2019s Witness and stated \u201c no \u201d because he had not reached that level . I am of the view , from the [ first ] applicant \u2019s evidence , that it is unlikely that he is a member of the GPE \u2019s Witnesses given that he claims to be a member since DATE and has not yet been baptised . ( Baptism and The Lord \u2019s Supper are the only Sacraments recognised by ORG . ) In view of this , I find his evasion of military service does not amount to persecution for any reason contemplated by LAW DATE ( as amended ) .", "With regard to the second ... applicant , I find her evidence that the police searched her apartment DATE after the applicant left for GPE to be contradicted by evidence from her and the first ... applicant . The first ... applicant stated that DATE after he arrived in GPE ( sic ) , he applied to the local police station for a forensic medical certificate to enable him to get medical treatment for his injuries . He stated that , as a result of this , the police in GPE ( sic ) started extradition proceedings on the grounds that he was avoiding military service . It is clear from this that the police in GPE were aware of the location of the first ... applicant and , in that regard , I find the second ... applicant \u2019s evidence that he apartment was searched on a DATE basis to be implausible .", "The second ... applicant , together with the first ... applicant , decided to leave GPE and travel to GPE . I am aware from country of origin information ( ORG report DATE ) that citizens of GPE are free to travel to GPE . I am also of the view that the second ... applicant could have relocated to GPE and lived there if she wished . Her reasons for leaving GPE would appear to be that she was being investigated for a criminal offence . In my view , the [ second ] applicant was fleeing prosecution and not persecution . In light of this , I find that the applicant has not demonstrated a well - founded fear of persecution while she lived in GPE .", "In the circumstances , I find that the applicants are not refugees within the meaning of LAW DATE ( as amended ) . \u201d", "By letter dated DATE the ORG informed the first and second applicants of its decision ( as required by LAW ) of LAW ) .
