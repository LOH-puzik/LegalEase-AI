His case received extensive coverage by the press and gave rise to considerable discussion on the relations between the public and the police .

CARDINAL of the journalists of your very own progressive party - newspaper - T\u00edminn [ The ORG ] - had a painful experience and returned with some injuries from the GPE TIME - life jungle . Often the perils of the jungle and other such inhospitable regions can help us to visualise the hardships that missionaries such as PERSON and PERSON had to endure , even if they were preaching the worth of PERSON \u2019s own GPE rather than the co - operative Utopia .", "( CARDINAL ) In this case trouble befell CARDINAL of your political missionaries , the journalist PERSON , in the town \u2019s night - life . The photographs of his facial injuries , spread across CARDINAL newspaper columns , have , of course , shocked us .", "( CARDINAL ) We do not want to accept that our policemen have damaged this journalist \u2019s handsome face in this way . All he was doing , he tells us , was innocently looking for his overcoat when the beasts in uniform in the aforementioned jungle attacked him .", "( CARDINAL ) In my opinion ORG case is of little importance . But as it has received a lot of attention and been widely discussed , I would like to use the opportunity to point out to you that the real problem is in fact bigger and much more horrifying .", "( CARDINAL ) Skafti \u2019s case , brought to our attention by the press , is but the tip of the iceberg . Beneath it , in the dark sea of silence , lurks a problem CARDINAL times bigger .", "( CARDINAL ) That is the part I would like to bring to your attention , because you are the Minister of ORG and thus in command of those wild beasts in uniform that creep around , silently or not , in the jungle of our town \u2019s TIME - life .", "( CARDINAL ) I am certainly not underestimating the pain and hardship that this young man has unnecessarily had to endure . However , ORG is obviously going to recover . The blue spots on his face will turn violet , then brown and in time they will eventually disappear . He will go back to working for [ The ORG ] and his case will be buried under the mounds of DATE to day scandals which will pile up like snow after a heavy snowstorm .", "That is if we do not use this opportunity to look at the problem in its entirety .", "( CARDINAL) DATE I had to spend DATE on a ward in our local hospital . In a room leading off the same corridor was a man in DATE lying in his bed . He was a promising and charming young person , but he was paralysed to the extent that he could not move any part of his body , other than his eyes . He was able to read with the aid of special machinery and a helping hand to turn the pages for him .", "I was told that his chance of recovery was minimal .", "( CARDINAL ) The young man \u2019s room - mates told me that his injuries had been inflicted by bouncers of a restaurant and some policemen . At first I could not believe this , so I enquired among the hospital staff and - Yes , they were right ; we had there a victim of the GPE TIME - squad .", "( CARDINAL ) The image of this paralysed youngster somehow followed me out of the hospital and I could n\u2019t help talking about his case . I then found out that most people had various stories of persons who had had a similar or even worse experiences with the beasts in uniform . Individuals reduced to a mental age of a new - born child as a result of strangle - holds that policemen and bouncers learn and use with brutal spontaneity instead of handling people with prudence and care . There are so many such stories , identical in substance , that you can hardly dismiss them merely as lies any more . Another thing that goes with those stories as inevitably as brutality follows stupidity is the statement that suing a policeman in such a case would be hopeless . The investigation would be undertaken by another department of the police and there be carried out by an \u00e9lite group who see it as their duty to wash all policemen clean of any accusations made against them .", "( CARDINAL ) The victims of the police brutes remain forgotten , without hope , as DATE pass without their causes ever being seriously discussed .", "( CARDINAL ) Now this might be CARDINAL of those rare occasions . It is the reason for this letter of mine .", "( CARDINAL ) I have little doubt that there is something essentially wrong in a system where the people in charge seem to disregard all sense of justice and misinterpret their duties by allowing brutes and sadists to act out their perversions - no matter who is the victim . In my opinion the GPE Chief of Police is being stubborn in refusing to relieve the accused policemen from their duties while the \u2018 J\u00f3nsson case\u2019 is being investigated . Moreover , he seems to lose little of his self - confidence , even though he is up against one of your own partisans in this case . But we shall see .", "( CARDINAL ) Even if PERSON wins his case this will be an exception and will change nothing . Other victims of this brutality will continue to pile up in silence as before .", "( CARDINAL ) My opinion is that the real problem lies with a system where policemen investigate other policemen \u2019s violations of correct professional conduct . This opinion I share with other much more competent persons - who are obviously hesitant in pronouncing their opinion on this matter fearing the reprisals and beatings that might follow .", "The matter is as serious as that .", "( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL of your predecessors in the office of Minister of ORG have received letters from me regarding these problems . Neither of them had the courtesy to answer .", "( CARDINAL ) Recently I have been looking at pictures of you in the paper and I was struck by your facial appearance of fairness and youthfulness mixed with confidence . This indeed is the very kind of facial expression that could at any time easily seep into your character even if it was originally only meant for the photographer .", "Therefore I am writing to you as well .", "My proposal is the same as it was before :", "( CARDINAL ) Stop putting these cases of police brutality into this perfunctory , useless automatic washing - machine . As long as policemen are allowed to clean one another you will never even have the possibility to consider the urgent things such as giving IQ and character tests which must be passed before they are taught how to exercise fatal tricks on people , to make them responsible in cases where they have momentarily lost control of their temper - all of which is needed in order to have a competent police force worthy of the power given to them .", "But how can we get rid of the old system ?", "( CARDINAL ) You have to form a committee of trustworthy people to investigate the rumours , gradually becoming public opinion , that there is more and more brutality within the GPE police force and being hushed up in an unnatural manner . Such a committee could ask victims of police brutality to come forward with their statements for eventual verification . Hopefully the committee will find that it is only a tiny minority of policemen who are responsible . Those individuals should be advised to look for other jobs .", "( CARDINAL ) I have the gut feeling that our Police Problem could be compared with the so - called ORG in the sense that comparatively few individuals are responsible for this negative public opinion of them . Furthermore , those individuals could not be said to be typical of either group - nor the most intelligent .", "( CARDINAL ) I have seen the policemen in this town perform many a good deed and therein I have met many an exemplary fellow . We can not do without them . But I feel I owe it to the young man I met at the local hospital to muster my courage and put forward this proposal : let us try cleaning up this mess so that those who , ready to risk their lives , embark on the adventure of the jungle of the GPE TIME - life in the future can at least be assured that a policeman in uniform is not among the perils therein .", "There are enough other wild beasts .", "( CARDINAL ) In court you sometimes put forward an alternative claim in case your main request is not accepted . Should you , PERSON , fail to ensure that this neutral investigation is carried out , I call upon able journalists ( Skafti for example ) to start this investigation and to publish the results in a book that would very probably become a bestseller .

Well - many people think that our policemen have already attacked too many a citizen , guilty or innocent .
