The police officer on duty , M.T. , omitted to inform the hospital and ORG of the whole situation . Had there been coordination between the doctor and social worker , who had known the situation in ORG \u2019s family better , measures for the prevention of suicide could perhaps have been taken .

Doctor PERSON also gave his oral evidence during the proceedings . He testified that after he had received the information from the police about their interview with ORG , he had told the police that he would need to examine ORG and then decide whether compulsory psychiatric treatment would be necessary .

ORG had appeared totally unstable that TIME , which had been noticeable to GPE because he worked with people .

At a hearing on DATE the trial court heard evidence from doctor PERSON He testified that on TIME at TIME he had been informed by the police that ORG had been behaving strangely and that he might do something bad . The police officer had not however known where ORG was at the time . Doctor PERSON explained that the usual practice in such cases was to examine the person and then decide whether admission to hospital was necessary . He also specified that the police officer who had called him had said that ORG could kill somebody or do something bad . This had prompted him to believe that his and the police \u2019s intervention had been necessary , and that ORG should be taken to the psychiatric hospital .

PERSON also explained ORG was known to him and that before seeing him , he had been informed by the on - duty commanding officer that he had already threatened to kill his wife .", "CARDINAL . In his statement GPE confirmed GPE \u2019s version of events , explaining that the police could take an individual to hospital or a police station and have a doctor examine him , but they had not considered ORG to be a danger so had not taken any such action .", "CARDINAL . Police officer PERSON stated that when officers GPE and GPE had returned from the bank they had said that ORG had not been drunk or aggressive but merely agitated , and that he had threatened suicide .

He had known that ORG had a violent background but stressed that he had not been registered as insane .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the deputy chief for the criminal police PERSON gave his oral evidence .

On DATE the trial court obtained a psychiatric report certifying that the first , second and third applicant and M.B.B. \u2019s mother had all experienced mental suffering after the events . The report was confirmed by the expert at a hearing held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the civil action and ordered the ORG to pay damages for failing to protect the life of the applicants\u2019 relative . The trial court held that the ORG \u2019s responsibility under LAW of LAW was objective , and that it was only necessary to establish whether the death had been a result of the unlawful or wrongful conduct of the ORG authorities . The relevant part of the judgment reads :", "\u201c ... It is not disputed between the parties that ORG called the police a little after CARDINAL a.m. PERSON informed the police of what had happened in the bank and about PERSON \u2019s appearance . This court fully accepts the statements of GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE as credible when they testified about ORG \u2019s state of mind [ in the bank ] . They stated that ORG had appeared totally unstable . The conclusion of the police officers GPE and GPE that ORG had been normal and calm and had not been a danger can not be accepted as logical . They reached such a conclusion after being informed by ORG that he had withdrawn the money for [ his ] funeral , and that he was going to kill himself and nobody could stop him . Taking this into account , [ this court considers that ] the average person could have reached the conclusion about ORG \u2019s state of mind referred to by witnesses [ F.]S. , GPE , GPE and GPE The police officers who needed to act with particular diligence should have also reached [ this ] conclusion about ORG \u2019s state of mind , which they failed to do . They thus failed to act in accordance with sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of ORG ... The defendant considers that there is no connection between the failures of the police and [ M.B.B. \u2019s death ] and that there is therefore no liability on GPE . This court considers differently . Had police officer PERSON complied with the order of the deputy chief for the criminal police PERSON , and informed the hospital and ORG at TIME , as noted in the report , it is highly probable that the outcome would have been avoided , particularly taking into account the statement of witness I.F ... As the liability of the ORG is objective ; it was for it to prove that the damage occurred as a result of a cause which could not have been avoided ( vis major ) , or that the damage resulted exclusively from the actions of the aggrieved party or CARDINAL party which could not have been predicted and where the outcome could not have been avoided ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . Nothing of [ the sort ] has been proven by the defendant . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Slatina Municipal State Attorney \u2019s ORG , representing the ORG in the proceedings , lodged an appeal with ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the first - instance judgment and ordered a retrial on the grounds that the first - instance court had erred in its findings that the liability of the ORG was objective as it was based on the existence of a fault , namely unlawfulness . That court further found that , irrespective of the fact that ORG had threatened suicide , there had been nothing requiring police officers GPE and GPE to treat the case as particularly urgent and to take ORG to a psychiatric hospital . It also accepted the police ORG statements that ORG had appeared calm during the interview . ORG instructed the first - instance court to question witnesses ORG and PERSON again to establish what actions doctor ORG had intended to take , since it was not clear whether he had intended to examine ORG or just to see whether he could be placed in a psychiatric hospital , as could be inferred from the statement of police officer PERSON", "DATE . In the resumed proceedings , at a hearing held on DATE , ORG heard doctor ORG and police officer M.T.", "CARDINAL . Doctor PERSON testified that the usual practice in similar cases was to immediately respond at the scene and to examine the person if he or she was available . The medical response team consisted of a doctor , a driver and medical technician and a nurse . They first had to examine the person and then the doctor could decide whether hospitalisation in a psychiatric hospital was necessary . Police intervention was only sought if the person could not be apprehended for the examination . As regards the case at issue , doctor PERSON explained that he had been called by a police officer who had told him that ORG had been behaving strangely and that he could do something bad . The police officer had not known where ORG was . Had he known , he would have immediately responded at the scene and examined him . Doctor PERSON also explained that he had to first examine the person and only then he could make a prescription for that person \u2019s admission to hospital . There had been no reason for him to check whether there had been a place in the hospital because it was for the hospital to decide what they wanted to do with his prescription and the person in question . In the present case , the information he had received from the police suggested that it had been necessary to examine ORG at the scene .", "CARDINAL . Police officer PERSON stated that on DATE in question he had informed doctor ORG that the police had had a person who was seriously disturbed and who should be given an injection in order to calm down .

On DATE ORG dismissed the civil action as ill - founded , and ordered the applicants to pay HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL in costs and expenses . The relevant part of the judgment reads :", "\u201c ... The liability of the defendant is based on the principle of fault ( section LANGUAGE of LAW ) . Unlawful conduct is conduct which is contrary to the law or an omission in the application of the law , which is committed deliberately or by accepting that it might cause damage to a third party . ... The purpose of section CARDINAL of LAW is to provide for the liability of the State where there is a wilful act contrary to the law with the intent of causing damage ... Acceptance [ of that outcome ] is conduct or an omission of a ORG official in the performance of his or her official duties where he or she was able to , according to his or her individual capability , take into account the objective requirements with due diligence , and which he or she failed to do . In the particular circumstances , there is no causal link between the damage and the omissions of police officer M.Kr . , in his capacity as on - duty commanding officer , to report DATE before [ the shootings ] about ORG \u2019s complaint that she had been followed by ORG This court finds nothing to suggest that the police officers who intervened at the bank , and who had had no knowledge of this , would have acted differently even if they had had such information . The plaintiffs also refer to the omissions of police officers GPE and GPE ... Under LAW of ORG the police may , in particularly urgent cases , take a mentally disturbed individual to a psychiatric hospital without prior medical examination , provided there is a reasonable suspicion that the individual poses an immediate threat to his life or health , or the life or health of others ... The events [ in the bank ] suggest that the police had an obligation to act under section CARDINAL of ORG and to secure ORG \u2019s medical examination , after which the doctor could decide whether to take to a psychiatric hospital . But in the particular circumstances police officers GPE and GPE could not have been expected to recognise that there was any particular urgency or that ORG should be taken to a psychiatric hospital without prior medical examination ... The omission of police officer [ M.T. ] to inform the hospital about ORG \u2019s behaviour is an irregularity in the performance of his official duties . However , the dispute between the parties is whether there is a causal link between this irregularity and the event ... Even if PERSON had informed the hospital at TIME , it is doubtful whether the doctor would have carried out an examination because at that time he had not known where ORG was . It follows that at the time ORG was no longer available to the police and according to the evidence [ submitted by ] ORG was in the bank sometime between TIME and TIME There is therefore no causal link between the incidents and the omissions of police officer M.T ... \u201c", "CARDINAL . The first , second and third applicants and ORG lodged an appeal against the above judgment with ORG , arguing that the ORG authorities had failed to prevent the killing of their relative , and that in accordance with the relevant domestic law they should have been awarded damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment . It held , however , that the first - instance court had erred in concluding that at TIME the police had not known ORG \u2019s whereabouts , because around that time the police had interviewed him at his home . In any event , the police could have informed the hospital immediately after TIME when they had received the call from the bank . Nevertheless , the court held that the police had done everything they could and that it could not be concluded that only intervention by the doctor in TIME after the information had been received from the bank would have prevented the incidents . The court also found that , irrespective of ORG \u2019s violent background and the indications that he was mentally disturbed , he had not acted violently on DATE of the incidents or DATE . It was true that police officers GPE and GPE had omitted to examine ORG under LAW of LAW , but he had not been behaving violently , so that omission could not be characterised as an irregularity in their work . Moreover , it was not certain whether ORG had a gun at the time and therefore it was in doubt whether such a police search could have prevented the incidents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first , second and third applicants and ORG lodged an appeal on points of law against the above judgment before ORG ( PERSON ) .", "DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law as ill - founded and upheld ORG judgment . It found that the lower courts had misinterpreted the relevant domestic law by holding that the liability of the ORG was based on the principle of fault because it was in fact based on the objective principle . It was thus sufficient to establish that there was unlawful or irregular conduct on the part of the ORG administration and the causal link to the damage thereby caused . In the case at issue , ORG held that there had been no causal link between the irregular work of the police officers and the killing of the applicants\u2019 relative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants ( including the fourth and fifth applicants , who had taken over the proceedings from ORG following her death on DATE ) lodged a constitutional complaint before ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) challenging the decisions of the lower courts .", "CARDINAL .
