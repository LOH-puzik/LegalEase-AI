For PERSON \u2019s family , the reason for that psychosis is the influence of ORG . \u201d", "The programme then discussed the activities of ORG in GPE . The journalist implied that the followers of PERSON in GPE held sex orgies . As to the applicant \u2019s identity , the journalist also mentioned that \u201c PERSON obtained a master \u2019s degree abroad , had an important job in State service ( dirbo atsaking\u0105 valstybin\u012f darb\u0105 ) \u201d and that the person was \u201c currently being treated at a psychiatric hospital \u201d .

She [ PERSON ] does not talk about that . She even says that she performs some kind of practice ( atlieka praktikas ) there ; she hides [ things ] .

That is very common . \u201d", "ORG , who according to the register of religious organisations in GPE is the \u201c leader \u201d and master ( lyderis ( meistras ) ) of ORG in GPE , stated during the broadcast that the applicant had been terrorised by her mother .

The young woman will need a long and difficult course of medical treatment ( mergina dar ilgai ir sunkiai gydysis ) . The fact that she has only been in this [ ORG ] centre for DATE leads one to reflect on how the practices of ORG can affect someone who is constantly seeking to liberate their soul . \u201d", "\u201c PERSON : Actually , there is a NORP atmosphere and a NORP resistance , maybe even a NORP resistance , against meditation , because there is no God in meditation ... \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s mother and sister were shown during the programme and identified by their real first names as \u201c PERSON , PERSON \u2019s mother \u201d and \u201c PERSON , PERSON \u2019s sister \u201d . They made statements about the destructive influence that , in their view , ORG had had on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE on the internet site of ORG the applicant published a CARDINAL - page open letter to the journalists at GPE , signing it with her real name and surname . She expressed regret that the broadcast had not been an objective portrayal of her story . She stated that \u201c by using me , you have maybe created an interesting story , but it is very CARDINAL - sided . Maybe by unraveling ( narpliodamos ) the story through my mother you also wanted to protect me and sought to help me , but in reality your broadcast has caused me to feel much distrust and a lot of pain \u201d . The applicant then mentioned that she had previously been admitted to psychiatric institutions in DATE and DATE , emphasising that those CARDINAL periods had been unrelated to meditation . She also wrote that she had only started attending the Ojas Meditation Centre in DATE and that her emotional breakdown in DATE had had no connection to those visits . For the applicant , the GPE journalists had therefore given an unfair account of her story , and had shown bias by implying that her mental health issues had been caused by meditating at FAC . The applicant also stated that in DATE she had consulted several psychotherapists ( psichoterapeutai ) , who had helped her realise that her psychological problems had roots in her childhood , when she had been controlled by and had lived in fear of emotional and physical violence from her mother . Even at the time of writing there had been resistance and mockery from her family when the applicant had shared her new interests , such as yoga or meditation . The applicant also stated that she \u201c had not been put under a spell ( neap\u017eav\u0117jo ) \u201d by meditation . Instead , meditation had entered her life naturally as the result of a long and intense spiritual search . She continued :", "\u201c Meditation for me is a way to learn about myself and the world , and on the basis of that understanding and by deepening it , to open myself to peace , joy , truth and love . DATE meditation for me is a means to reduce emotional , spiritual and psychological tension and stress , to understand the reasons behind unhappiness , including by learning how to avoid it . Meditation allows me to live a more conscious life ( s\u0105moningesnis ) and one which is full of joy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant also referred in the letter to her involuntary admission to ORG in DATE , where she had been taken by force and deceit , and where she had never agreed to be treated . She wrote that the psychiatrists had blindly believed her mother \u2019s stories and had diagnosed her as being under the influence of a sect ( sektanti\u0161kumas ) . That had led to the psychiatric treatment she had received being mainly directed at how to cure her from practising meditation ( pagydyti CARDINAL meditacijos ) in a hostile environment that had damaged her psychologically and emotionally . In particular , the psychiatrists at the hospital had interrogated her ( buvau kamantin\u0117jama ) about FAC and its practices , forced her to promise not to meditate , alleged that sex orgies had taken place there , that meditation was harmful for her mental health , that she should follow the NORP religion which is traditional in GPE and that meditation was not compatible with her \u201c social status \u201d . During CARDINAL visit ( vizitacija ) , a doctor had called her \u201c the CARDINAL from the FAC \u201d , rather than using her name . The applicant also wrote that when she had spoken about meditation at FAC doctor PERSON had simply made fun of it , had said that that was not meditation , and that the applicant knew nothing about what meditation actually was . The applicant had not been able to resist the psychiatrists at the hospital because refusing to talk to them or disagreeing with their statements about the Ojas Meditation Centre or their instructions to stop meditating had been treated as signs of mental illness . For that reason , the amount of medication at the hospital had not been reduced for a long time , strong drugs had been injected into her , and her release from hospital had been postponed . The applicant also noted that she had intended to submit a written statement to the hospital that she refused treatment , but she had been persuaded not to do so because the doctors had threatened that otherwise they would diagnose her problems in such a way that could later prevent her from getting a job .", "CARDINAL . The applicant concluded by noting that in DATE she had attended a session at FAC , and had finally been able to meditate and recover after DATE in ORG in a hostile environment that had harmed her mind and body . She saw meditation as means to live a more conscious and meaningful life .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant sued ORG for compensation for non - pecuniary damage . She alleged : ( CARDINAL ) unlawful deprivation of liberty ; ( CARDINAL ) a violation of her right to a private life ; ( CARDINAL ) a violation of her right to freedom of religion ; ( CARDINAL ) a violation of her right to the inviolability of her body ; ( CARDINAL ) failure to provide proper medical care ; and ( CARDINAL ) a breach of her right to be properly informed about her diagnosis , methods of treatment and prognosis .", "CARDINAL . Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital responded by saying that on DATE the applicant had been involuntarily hospitalised since she had been in a state of acute psychosis and had posed a danger to herself and others . The hospital also submitted that the applicant had never complained in writing about being held unlawfully . The hospital argued that it had not disclosed any confidential information about the applicant , and that it could not be responsible for the actions of the applicant \u2019s mother and the way the PERSON broadcast had been presented . It added that the PERSON religious movement had been acting outside the law in DATE because it had only been registered in GPE as a religious movement on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Furthermore , the applicant had not proved that the hospital had had no reason to think that her non - traditional religious beliefs had been the reason behind her emotional outburst ( emocin\u0117s i\u0161krovos prie\u017eastis ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered ORG at ORG to produce a report to answer certain questions regarding the applicant \u2019s medical condition and her admission to ORG DATE and DATE on the basis of her medical records . The forensic report was produced in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s action .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted at the outset that according to Articles DATE and CARDINAL of ORG a person could be placed in hospital without his or her consent if there was a clear and present danger of him or her harming themselves or others . Even then , a court order was needed within DATE to keep the person in hospital . Should a court refuse such an order , the forced hospitalisation and treatment had to be discontinued ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the forensic expert report and other material , ORG firstly observed that the applicant had not actually denied that she might have required medical assistance on DATE because of her state of mind . However , the court found that as of CARDINAL DATE she had no longer been in need of medical support . That was confirmed by the applicant \u2019s medical file , where doctor PERSON had noted on DATE at CARDINAL TIME that \u201c the patient is responding to meaningful contact , is correctly orientated ( pacient\u0117 prieinama prasmingam kontaktui , orientuota teisingai ) \u201d . Also , at TIME on DATE , doctor ORG , the other psychiatrist treating her at ORG , had written that \u201c currently the patient is sleepy because of medication ... her mind is clear , she is well orientated when it comes to place and time ... currently the affect is flat ( pacient\u0117 \u0161.m . mieguista d\u0117l vaist\u0173 poveikio , s\u0105mon\u0117 ai\u0161ki , orientacija vietoje ir laike tiksli ... \u0161iuo metu afektas lygus ) \u201d . The court also based itself on the applicant \u2019s other medical records . All that meant that the applicant \u2019s state of health had no longer corresponded to that set down in DATE ORG to permit her further forced hospitalisation . Despite that , the applicant had been held against her will and treated at ORG until DATE , without the hospital ever asking for a court order . That had been in breach of the twoday time - limit set in LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG also agreed with the applicant \u2019s argument that she had not been able to leave the hospital because she was under the influence of drugs , had faced a threat of being physically restrained if she disobeyed the doctors , and had been under a strict regime . The court noted that the requirement that a psychiatric patient should normally be able to express his or her consent to be hospitalised and treated had also been underlined by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG also observed that there was no written evidence that the applicant had ever agreed to be placed in ORG DATE and DATE . According to the forensic expert report , the applicant had not been able to understand her actions on CARDINAL DATE ; however , the experts had not reached the same conclusion about the period DATE and DATE . That notwithstanding , the applicant had been forced to stay in hospital for DATE for treatment . The court also emphasised that the patient was always the weaker party in relation to the hospital and its personnel . The hospital \u2019s argument that the applicant had agreed to stay by acquiescence was therefore null and void . The court also relied on doctor ORG \u2019s admission during court hearings that the applicant \u2019s life had \u201c not necessarily been in danger \u201d for all of DATE of treatment and to the same conclusion by the applicant \u2019s treating doctor ORG In fact , the records signed by doctor PERSON on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE stating that the applicant was being treated at the hospital had given CARDINAL side ( viena\u0161ali\u0161ki ) of the situation as they had not been countersigned by the applicant . In that context , the court also had regard to the applicant \u2019s explanation that because of the side effects of the medication ( sleepiness , inability to concentrate ) and the possibility of physical restraint ( being tied down ) in case of disobedience , she had not been able to express her disagreement about being treated at the hospital in writing . The court also considered that the consent given on DATE by the applicant \u2019s cousin , ORG , for the applicant to be put in hospital and treated could also not be considered as an act of agreement expressed by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In the light of those factors , ORG concluded that the procedure set down in domestic law for forced admission to hospital and treatment had not only been breached in the applicant \u2019s case , but outright disregarded .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s mother also testified before ORG . She said that she had learned on DATE that the applicant was delirious and had asked ORG for help . That had led to the applicant being taken to ORG . The mother also said she had contacted ORG in GPE about her daughter , but had not received a constructive response . She had then contacted the journalists from GPE , because she had wished to find out what was happening to her daughter . She had not known what diagnosis the psychiatric hospital had given the applicant and had only told the GPE journalists which hospital her daughter was in .", "CARDINAL . Doctor PERSON testified that she was head of division ( skyriaus ved\u0117ja ) at ORG when the applicant had been treated there . She said that the journalists had not called her directly but that the hospital administration had informed her that they would come and had \u201c kind of stated that the talk would be about ORG \u201d . The doctor testified that she had \u201c not discussed [ the applicant \u2019s ] health \u201d with the journalists , only the Ojas Meditation Centre and meditation as such .", "CARDINAL . ORG then turned to the applicant \u2019s complaint of a breach of her right to privacy . Relying on Article CARDINAL of ORG and LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) , the court noted that \u201c there was evidence in the case - file ( byloje yra pateiktas \u012frodymas ) that doctor PERSON had , without obtaining the applicant \u2019s consent to disclose confidential information , revealed to the GPE journalists that the applicant had been diagnosed with acute psychosis ( \u016bmin\u0117 psichoz\u0117 ) , that she was being treated at ORG , and that she had studied in GPE \u201d . The interview with the doctor had been shown during the PERSON programme on DATE . The court noted that even in DATE ( \u0161iuo metu ) there were not many people in GPE who had studied in GPE and so that characteristic had not been very common . The court also considered that \u201c other information revealed to the journalists about the applicant could also allow the applicant \u2019s identity to be established \u201d , although the court did not specify what other information it meant .", "CARDINAL . The court then had regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint about freedom of religion by referring to LAW . It also relied on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The court found valid the applicant \u2019s complaints that the doctors had tried to dissuade ( atkalb\u0117ti ) her from meditating , attempted to alter her views on non - traditional meditation religion and had treated her against meditating and attending the Ojas Meditation Centre . That conclusion was based on the applicant \u2019s medical file , which contained the following records for CARDINAL May and DATE and DATE : \u201c ... absence of a critical attitude towards attending [ ORG \u201d ; \u201c during psycho - correction expressed opinion in categorical terms about attending FAC , argues , that \u2018 it is a personal LOC \u201d ; \u201c when efforts were made during psycho - correction to get the applicant to form a critical attitude ( suformuoti kritik\u0105 ) towards non - traditional religious beliefs , [ the applicant ] for a long time remained uncritical and also categorical \u201d . The first - instance court underlined the fact that the psychiatric hospital had not provided any proof of the suggestion that practising a non - traditional religion would place the applicant or others in danger . The court thus concluded that \u201c by attempting to alter the applicant \u2019s attitude to non - traditional religion , meditation , and their practice at FAC \u201d the hospital had breached her right to freedom of religion . Lastly , the court rejected as legally irrelevant the hospital \u2019s assertion that at the time of the applicant \u2019s admission to hospital the meditation centre had been operating \u201c unlawfully \u201d . ORG observed that the religious movement had been a party to court proceedings for its registration at the time and had been registered on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . After finding that between CARDINAL DATE and DATE the applicant had been placed in hospital and given treatment against her will in breach of domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG considered that there had therefore been a breach of the applicant \u2019s right to the inviolability of her body . Furthermore , ORG had failed to prove that it had properly informed the applicant about her state of health , her diagnosis , the methods of treatment and the prognosis for her condition ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . However , ORG dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant \u2019s claims that she had been provided with inappropriate medical care at ORG and that the doctors there had forged her medical records .", "CARDINAL . ORG thus granted the applicant \u2019s civil claim in full and awarded her MONEY ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage . She was also awarded legal costs of LTL MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital appealed . According to the hospital , there was no proof that doctor PERSON had disclosed confidential information about the applicant \u2019s acute psychosis and that she was being treated at the hospital . The doctor had merely given an opinion about an unidentified person . Moreover , the doctor had pointed out during the firstinstance hearings that she had only given her views when answering the questions the journalists had put to her . CARDINAL witnesses \u2013 the applicant \u2019s mother , sister and the journalist GPE \u2013 had explained during the firstinstance court \u2019s hearings that the television programme had been initiated by the applicant \u2019s relatives , who had provided information about the applicant . The first - instance court \u2019s reference to studies in GPE as a way of identifying someone was not sufficiently weighty either , and such information was not protected under LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of religion , the hospital argued that the lower court had erred in equating meditation with religion . The fact that since DATE the applicant had attended meditation sessions of \u201c unknown origin and manner ( neai\u0161kios kilm\u0117s ir pob\u016bd\u017eio meditacijas ) \u201d and that they could have been CARDINAL of the reasons behind her illness , had not been denied . The hospital insisted that in DATE ORG had been operating outside the law . The hospital also relied on a CARDINAL DATE statement by ORG that PERSON movement centres did not have the status of a religion ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which supported the hospital \u2019s view that meditation was not a religious practice . Accordingly , the applicant \u2019s \u201c fictitious \u201d ( tariama ) religious freedom had not been breached .", "CARDINAL . The applicant responded by submitting that the right to privacy included the right not to have her health or other confidential information revealed to the journalists or her mother . The applicant added that when she had been in the psychiatric hospital , doctor PERSON had persistently asked about the meditation she practised and had spoken of it with contempt . Doctor PERSON would tenaciously try to persuade her to denounce her religion and give up meditation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the hospital \u2019s appeal in part .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court upheld ORG finding that on the basis of her health on DATE the applicant had been lawfully placed in ORG . Her condition DATE had corresponded to the domestic legal requirements for involuntary hospitalisation ( see paragraph DATE below ) . However , the hospital had not provided any evidence that her treatment from CARDINAL May had been indispensable . It was therefore clear that as of that date her treatment at the hospital and her presence there had been involuntary and also amounted to an unlawful deprivation of liberty . ORG relied on ORG practice in case no . CARDINAL of DATE to the effect that it was obligatory to follow the procedure set out in LAW and CARDINAL of ORG , both when providing a patient with the necessary help ( b\u016btinoji pagalba ) and when placing that person in hospital without his or her consent . Under that procedure , it had been possible to place the applicant in hospital and treat her without her consent for no longer than TIME . Without a court order , the forced hospitalisation and forced treatment had to be discontinued . However , there was no information in the case file that such an order had been granted . To make matters worse , the hospital had never even asked the court for such an authorisation . ORG thus fully shared the lower court \u2019s view that legal procedures had been outright disregarded , making the applicant \u2019s stay in the hospital unlawful .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that under LAW and LAW , patients had a right to have information about their health kept confidential ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . It could not be disclosed by doctor in charge of treatment or by hospital administration .", "CARDINAL . That being so , ORG did not agree with the firstinstance court \u2019s conclusion that doctor PERSON \u2019s interview with the journalists , which had been shown during the television programme of DATE , had disclosed information that had revealed the applicant \u2019s identity . The appellate court relied on ORG ruling in case no . CARDINALK-CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , where it had found that in cases where there was no direct mention of a person in a publication , the process of identification was based on the aggregate evidence of the presence of features which could sufficiently describe the person in mind ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the particular case of the applicant , ORG also referred to her open letter of DATE to the GPE journalists ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , where she had acknowledged that the television broadcast had been instigated by members of her family , that she had not been shown in the programme in person , and that she had been given a different name . ORG considered that the fact that the main character of the programme ( laidos heroj\u0117 ) had studied in GPE was not sufficient to establish that the programme was about the applicant . As the applicant had not established that the information disclosed during the broadcast had allowed her to be identified , her claim for breach of privacy had to be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the appellate court rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that her privacy had been breached because confidential information had been given to her mother . The applicant had been treated earlier in psychiatric institutions in GPE and ORG because of mental health problems and her mother had been aware of those previous periods in hospital . Moreover , providing information to close relatives about the applicant \u2019s health could not be regarded as a breach of her right to privacy .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the right to freedom of religion had been enshrined in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and LAW . It also noted that LAW , people in hospital had the right to perform religious rites . That right could be restricted by a psychiatrist \u2019s decision only if there was a clear danger to the patient or others , and such restrictions had to be recorded in the patient \u2019s medical file ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On the facts of the case , ORG disagreed with the lower court \u2019s conclusion that there had been a breach of the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of religion while she was in ORG . For ORG , there was no evidence in the file that the applicant had been forbidden from performing religious rites . Even though the medical records showed ( ORG matyti ) that her doctors had tried to get the applicant to form a critical attitude towards her religious convictions ( religinius \u012fsitikinimus ) , there was no information that any restrictions had been applied to her . ORG found that \u201c the ORG attempts to get the applicant to form a critical attitude towards her religious convictions did not mean that [ the applicant \u2019s ] religious freedom had been breached \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s findings that there was no proof that the applicant had received inappropriate medical treatment . It also shared the lower court \u2019s conclusion that ORG had not properly informed the applicant about the treatment she received therein .", "CARDINAL . Having dismissed part of the applicant \u2019s complaints , ORG lowered the award for non - pecuniary damage to LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) . The applicant was also ordered to pay ORG legal costs of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) . Lastly , the appellate court quashed the part of the first - instance decision on the applicant \u2019s costs being paid by the hospital so she had to bear the legal costs herself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law . She argued that the lower courts had failed to properly apply Convention norms on the right to privacy and freedom of religion .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of DATE ORG refused to admit the appeal for examination , holding that the applicant \u2019s arguments were not sufficient to merit examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG applied to ORG to be registered as a religious community .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application because it considered that although the ORG was on the \u201c border between self - help psychology and religion ( egzistuojantis savipagalbos psichologijos ir religijos paribyje ) \u201d , it should not be treated as a religious community . Even though the PERSON teachings mentioned in ORG by - laws were called religious , meditation there was more based on esoteric doctrines of self - improvement than on a religious practice whose main feature was connecting with God , gods or other sacred forms . ORG also noted that PERSON movements did not have the status of a religion in western LOC countries .", "CARDINAL . The Ojas Meditation Centre then started court proceedings . Its action was eventually granted by ORG on DATE . The court found no evidence that ORG propagated any controversial practices amongst its members . It was registered as a religious community ( religin\u0117 bendruomen\u0117 ) on DATE ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
