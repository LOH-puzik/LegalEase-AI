ORG When the applicant bought the property it was covered by a subdivision plan ( avstyckningsplan - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , adopted in DATE , according to which no building could be constructed on a plot of CARDINAL m\u00b2 until sufficient water and sewage facilities had been provided for ( a water and sewage system had been built at DATE ) . The property was also covered by an area plan ( omr\u00e5desplan - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , adopted in DATE , which described the property mainly as a public area containing green spaces , streets and car parking , and by a building prohibition pursuant to section CARDINAL of FAC ( byggnadslagen , \" LAW \" - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) issued on CARDINAL DATE and lasting until DATE . The Government also claimed that the regulations for non - planned areas ( utomplansbest\u00e4mmelser ) applied but the applicant contested this ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The first building prohibition under section CARDINAL of LAW covering the applicant \u2019s property was issued by ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen , \" the ORG \" ) of GPE on DATE and was valid for DATE . This prohibition has subsequently been prolonged by ORG for DATE each time , leaving the property unaffected for only a few brief intermediate periods . The last decision was taken on CARDINAL DATE and was valid until DATE . On DATE , with the entry into force of LAW DATE ( Plan - och Bygglagen , \" LAW \" ) , the existing system for prohibitions on construction was abolished and replaced by a new one ( see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the municipality of GPE was merged with the municipality of PERSON , but on DATE GPE again became a separate municipality .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG ( byggnadsn\u00e4mnden ) of PERSON stated in a preliminary opinion , requested by the applicant , that it was not prepared to permit the division of his property into smaller plots . In its decision ORG referred inter alia to the area plan adopted in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant turned to ORG and requested that the municipality be ordered to adopt a town plan ( stadsplan ) for the central parts of GPE .

ORG The applicant also complained to ORG ( justitieombudsmannen , PERSON ) who replied in a letter of CARDINAL DATE that he was well aware of the problems which could arise as a result of lengthy building prohibitions .
