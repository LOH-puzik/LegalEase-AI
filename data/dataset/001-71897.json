SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , ORG D \u201d ) and PERSON ( \u201c M \u201d ) , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively . They are mother and daughter . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants arrived in GPE on DATE and applied for asylum on DATE the same year . They presented genuine passports , valid until DATE and DATE respectively , as well as visas valid from DATE to DATE , issued by ORG in GPE on DATE . The applicants had previously been granted visas to GPE on CARDINAL separate occasions ; D in DATE and M in DATE , both for the purpose of visiting relatives . D \u2019s mother ( M \u2019s grandmother ) had been a permanent resident of this country since DATE , as had CARDINAL sisters and a brother of NORP", "ORG ( Migrationsverket ) conducted an initial interview with the applicants on DATE . D essentially stated the following : Her mother had died on DATE . She applied for asylum in GPE solely because of the problems she had experienced with her husband in GPE ( henceforth referred to as \u201c H \u201d ) . They had married in DATE and since then he had repeatedly subjected her to harassment and physical assault . They had CARDINAL children together , M and a son born in DATE . H had also assaulted the son . The assaults had occurred when H , an alcoholic , was drunk and had caused D injuries such as a broken jaw . At CARDINAL point , D had been in surgery for a navel rupture . Before the wound had healed , H had stabbed her in the stomach with a knife so that she had to be operated again . D had not reported any of the incidents of assault to the NORP authorities because they would not offer her any protection anyway . Furthermore , H was an influential person . He was retired but had worked in the military , where he had held the rank of colonel . She believed that he worked for the revolutionary committee ; he had done so previously . The stabbing incident had been automatically reported to the police , but she had told them that she had fainted and could not remember what had happened . The police had not pursued the matter any further . She had not divorced H , because this was not possible for her , being a woman . However , they had been living apart since DATE , when he had thrown her and the children out of their home . Prior to that they had lived apart from time to time , but this time the separation had been definite . D had moved with the children into her mother \u2019s home in GPE and , after the son had married , D and M had lived there alone . However , H had continued to harass the applicants , claiming that they were women of no morals . He had asserted that M must marry a man he had chosen for her in order to restore her father \u2019s honour . If M would disobey him , he had threatened to cut her throat . Despite the discords , H had given his permission for D to apply for a passport . This passport had been issued on DATE . This time she had left GPE without his knowledge . The additional consent he had given her to travel outside GPE in DATE still applied . Since the separation in DATE , D had worked as a hairdresser and , in addition to an inheritance from her father , she had received financial support from her mother and family .", "At the interview on DATE , M essentially stated the following : She had left GPE because of her father . She and D had lived in her grandmother \u2019s home in GPE for DATE but had also stayed with H intermittently . However , they had not returned to him since their last visit to GPE . She had studied at the university in PERSON DATE and was currently working at a private pharmaceutical company . While she had still been studying , she had been interrogated by the security forces several times , the last time in DATE . H had friends in the security forces . She had been interrogated because of his claim that she was a girl of bad morals . He had not been able to take her from the university because she had already paid the entrance fee . The man he wanted her to marry was already married .", "ORG conducted a second interview with NORP and M on DATE . On this occasion D essentially added the following : Her mother had been buried in GPE on DATE . D \u2019s siblings had brought the remains from GPE to GPE . H had tried to ruin the funeral . He had taken M to a physician in forensic medicine to ascertain whether she was still a virgin . D had not lived with H since DATE but had visited him at times when he had been ill . He had allowed her and the children to live on their own so that he would be free to get drunk and would not have to pay for them . After the revolution he had worked in the revolutionary court for DATE . Just before retiring in DATE , he had been in command over NORP prisoners of war . Since then he had worked secretly for the revolutionary committee but she did not know exactly for whom . The committee was part of the security forces ( PERSON ) and its task was to ensure that people followed rules of dress and behaviour . There were several committees named after geographical areas . H knew that she and M had left GPE , but she did not know whether he had reported her to some authority . H had disapproved of M \u2019s studies and had physically assaulted M CARDINAL or CARDINAL times when he had come to visit her at her student residence .", "With regard to the stabbing incident , D first stated that the operation for the navel rupture had been carried out in DATE and that H had come to see her while she had still been in bed recovering . She later stated that the operation , which had allegedly occurred on DATE , had not been well performed . H had asked what she had done wrong against God , since she had not yet recovered , and had stabbed her . She had first thought that her stitches had come undone . When she had opened her eyes she was in hospital . The police had arrived and told her that H had stabbed her . When asked by the interviewer why the police had come to the hospital , D said that hospitals were obliged to report knife and bullet injuries to the police . She further stated that when she had regained consciousness she had told the police what had happened . They had also talked with the nurse and the doctors . She had not contacted the police to find out what had happened with the investigation , and assumed that it had been dropped since no one had contacted her about it .", "During the second interview on DATE , M essentially added the following : H had come to the university CARDINAL times during DATE she had studied there . He had been rude and had always given her a smack on the face . On most occasions he had been accompanied by some of his friends from the committee in GPE , which was a group of people belonging to ORG ( a paramilitary volunteer force operating in GPE ) . They made sure that people followed strict moral rules . The last time M and her mother had stayed with H had been in DATE when they had returned from GPE . They had stayed with him for DATE . They had moved away from him for the first time in DATE and had moved back and forth a number of times until DATE . Since DATE they had not returned to him .", "In submissions of DATE to ORG , counsel for the applicants stated the following : The son of the family had recently told the applicants that H had threatened and blamed him for their departure from GPE . H had further stated that he intended to put them on trial in order to have them sentenced to stoning when they returned to GPE . As to what extent the applicants had lived with him , it was submitted that the applicants had returned to him on some occasions DATE because it had been difficult to live without him and because he had repeatedly promised to give up drinking and stop battering NORP However , he had never kept his promise and they had not lived with him since DATE after returning from GPE in DATE .", "To the submission of DATE were appended CARDINAL documents , seemingly drafted by NORP authorities : a \u201c statement \u201d issued by the \u201c NORP legal complex \u201d on DATE , apparently based on a report made by H , and CARDINAL summonses instructing the applicants to appear at the complex on DATE . The applicants also invoked a marriage licence between NORP and H.", "On DATE ORG rejected the ORG request for a residence permit and ordered that they be deported to GPE . The ORG questioned the veracity of the ORG statements concerning the alleged actions and controlling influence of H , as the applicants had lived on their own since DATE , as M had been able to study in another town DATE , and as they had been able to leave for GPE in DATE and in DATE . Noting that H was retired , ORG also found that the applicants had not shown that he was a man of great influence in NORP society or that he was involved with the security forces . ORG also found it remarkable that the applicants had waited DATE after their arrival in GPE to apply for asylum . The fact that D \u2019s mother had died could not explain this delay , as she had died and had been buried in GPE before the applicants left for GPE . ORG further noted that D had given conflicting information on her reporting the stabbing incident to the police . It also took into account that the applicants had not turned to the police to report H \u2019s alleged threats and harassment , and that D had not filed for divorce . In conclusion , ORG did not find the ORG statements credible .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nnings - n\u00e4mnden ) on DATE . In the appeal they submitted that they had applied for asylum while their visas were still valid and that they were staying legally in GPE . The reason why they had not applied for asylum earlier was that they had been busy with different mourning ceremonies among relatives and friends and that D had been in a bad mental state due to her mother \u2019s death . It was furthermore submitted that D \u2019s operation for the navel rupture had taken place at DATE , and that H had stabbed her on DATE . In this respect the applicants invoked an operation report sheet and a note of medical records . They also invoked an ORG card to confirm their claim that H was employed by ORG .", "Further submissions were made to ORG on DATE . Appended to the submissions was a summons ( \u201c warning \u201d ) directed at D to appear before the family court in GPE on DATE in order to respond to a report made against her by H. The applicants stated that the son had sent the summons to GPE by fax and that , according to the summons , there was further documentation in the case , the content of which D was not aware , and which she did not know how to access unless she was to appear in person before the court . D submitted that a summons to the family court could be very serious because the various religious authorities cooperated closely with that court , which she believed to be the case here .", "On DATE the applicants made yet another submission to ORG . They claimed that the report filed by H against D had turned out to concern adultery and had resulted in D being sentenced in her absence by an NORP court to death by stoning . The son had allegedly obtained the report and the judgment by bribing court officials . As it appears , the report had been filed on DATE , the hearing held on DATE and the judgment issued DATE .", "In final submissions of DATE , the applicants claimed that the circumstances that had led to the judgment against D gave strong reason to believe that M would face a similar charge and conviction .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the ORG appeal . It generally agreed with ORG assessment and added the following : It noted that the medical documents concerning D \u2019s operation for stabbing wounds were dated DATE and not DATE , as alleged by NORP Although D had stated that she had been operated for a navel rupture before the alleged stabbing , the documents did not mention any such operation . In regard to the alleged judgment and death sentence against NORP , ORG found it remarkable that she had been sentenced in absentia , having regard to the evidence requirements under the hod\u00fbd rules of the NORP criminal law . ORG also noted that the judgment submitted by the applicants stated that it was final , whereas NORP death sentences were subject to appeal .", "Following the ORG \u2019s indications under LAW , ORG decided , by decisions of DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE , to stay the enforcement of the deportation order against the applicants , on the latter occasion without a time - limit ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
