Having been a judge since DATE and a member of ORG since DATE , on CARDINAL DATE he was appointed Vice - President for a DATE term by the President of the Republic , after being proposed for the post by the President of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The mandate of the President of ORG was prematurely terminated , upon the entry into force of LAW DATE , in reaction to his criticisms and publicly expressed views regarding proposed judicial reforms ( see PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In connection with these events , a proposal for the termination of the applicant \u2019s mandate as Vice - President was submitted to ORG on DATE , and was adopted on DATE in the form of LAW no . ORG of DATE on ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Accordingly , as of DATE , the applicant was removed from his position as Vice - President , DATE and DATE before the scheduled expiry of his mandate .

CARDINAL . ) ORG , adopted by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , ORG rejected the constitutional complaint . It held that the premature termination of the applicant \u2019s term of office as Vice - President had not violated LAW , since it had been sufficiently justified by the full - scale reorganisation of the judicial system and important changes made in respect of the tasks and competences of the President of the GPE . It noted that the GPE \u2019s tasks and competences had been broadened , in particular with regard to the supervision of the legality of municipal council regulations ( for the relevant parts of ORG judgment see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL judges dissented and considered that the changes concerning the judicial system , the new GPE and the person of its president had not fundamentally affected the status of the Vice - President .

The dissenting judges concluded that the premature termination of the applicant \u2019s term of office had not been sufficiently justified by the reorganisation of the judicial system ; and that it had weakened the guarantees in respect of the separation of powers , had been contrary to the prohibition on retroactive legislation , and had breached the principle of the rule of law and the right to a remedy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as a consequence of the lowering of the judges\u2019 mandatory retirement age pursuant to section CARDINAL ( ha ) of Act no .

Following ORG judgment of DATE , ORG adopted a modified scheme governing the reduction of judges\u2019 compulsory retirement age and provided different options for those who had already been affected by the unconstitutional legislation ( see Act no .
