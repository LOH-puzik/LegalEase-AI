The first applicant is a religious community established in GPE , and the second to fifth applicants were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second to fifth applicants and CARDINAL other claimants requested the Federal Minister for Education and Arts ( PERSON f\u00fcr ORG ) to recognise the first applicant as a religious society ( Religionsgesellschaft ) under LAW ) . Since the Minister did not respond , the applicants subsequently filed a complaint ( Beschwerde ) with ORG ( Volksanwaltschaft ) about the Minister \u2019s inactivity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a statement concerning the complaint . It considered that the Minister \u2019s inactivity for DATE constituted an undesirable state of affairs in public administration ( PERSON i m Bereich der \u00f6ffentlichen LOC ) even though the authority was not formally obliged under the applicable law to take a decision since recognition of a religious society had to be taken in the form of a decree ( Verordnung ) . However , since an agreement had been reached in a meeting between the applicants and the Ministry on DATE , no further steps were required by ORG . The contents of this agreement were not disclosed by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second to fifth applicants requested the Federal Minister for ORG , Arts and Sports ( PERSON f\u00fcr GPE , ORG ) to recognise the first applicant as a religious society .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister did not grant the request and , after several reminders , informed the applicants that under LAW they had no right to obtain a formal decision ( Bescheid ) on their request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a direct application ( PERSON ) with ORG ) . They requested the court to repeal LAW , as in their view , this provision violated the right to freedom of religion and to freedom of association . They also argued that they were directly affected by this provision without it being necessary for a formal decision by an administrative authority to be taken ( LAW in fine of LAW ( Bundes - Verfassungsgesetz ) ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Bundesregierung ) submitted their observations to ORG . On DATE ORG asked ORG to submit supplementary observations , which were filed on DATE . ORG argued , inter alia , that the provisions at issue were in conformity with LAW as it was possible for the applicants to found a religious association under LAW ( Vereinsgesetz ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG complaint as inadmissible . Relying on LAW , the court considered that they were not directly affected by the impugned provisions as , in the light of its judgment of DATE ( VfSlg [ Judgments and Decisions of ORG ] DATE ) , they had a right to have their case determined by an administrative authority . However , they had not exhausted the legal remedies available to them since they had failed to lodge an application under LAW with ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) against the Minister \u2019s failure to give a decision ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged such an application with ORG . They asked the court to decide on their request for recognition of the first applicant as a religious society under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG request as inadmissible . Referring to its previous case - law on the matter , it found that under LAW , a positive decision had to be taken by the competent minister in the form of a decree ( Verordnung ) , whereas under LAW , ORG was only competent to deliver individual decisions ( PERSON ) and not decrees in the place of an administrative authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants again lodged a direct application under LAW in fine of LAW with ORG , seeking to have sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE LAW repealed . Relying on LAW , they argued that they had no effective remedy against the authority which had arbitrarily refused to determine their case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG complaint as inadmissible . It found that it had already decided the matter in its decision of DATE . As an obiter dictum the court indicated , however , that the second to fifth applicants might request ORG to examine a complaint under LAW against the Minister \u2019s failure to decide on the request for recognition . Once ORG refused this request , they could apply to ORG under LAW for determination of a case where CARDINAL courts ( namely ORG and ORG ) declined jurisdiction ( negativer Kompetenzkonflikt ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second to fifth applicants lodged such a complaint , which ORG on DATE rejected as inadmissible for lack of jurisdiction . It held that there was no legal provision entitling it to decide on applications about an authority \u2019s failure to give a decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested ORG under LAW to determine the conflict of jurisdiction between ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing . On DATE the court quashed ORG decision of DATE and decided that ORG had jurisdiction to decide on the ORG complaint of DATE . ORG found that under LAW a religious body had a subjective right to recognition as a religious society provided that the conditions laid down in that LAW were met . The rule of law required that such a right be an enforceable one , in other words , that refusal to grant recognition should be subject to review by the NORP courts and not left to the sole discretion of the administrative authorities . In order to guarantee such a review it was necessary for a negative decision refusing recognition to be taken in the form of a written decision ( PERSON ) . Under the NORP legal order , only when taking such decisions were the competent authorities bound to deal with a request by a party , whereas no such obligation existed with regard to decrees ( ORG ) . A positive decision had to be taken in the form of a decree as it not only had effect vis - \u00e0 - vis the parties but also vis - \u00e0 - vis the general public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the Federal Minister for Education and ORG ( MONEY GPE und kulturelle Angelegenheiten \u2013 \u201c the Minister \u201d ) to submit the case file within DATE and to communicate the arguments in favour of and against recognition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Federal Minister submitted observations to ORG , arguing that under the hitherto existing law , a decision was not required and requesting a DATE extension of the time - limit for submission of the case file and detailed observations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened preliminary proceedings ( GPE ) and ordered the Minister to decide within DATE on the ORG request for recognition . The Federal Minister failed to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a binding decision ( Erkenntnis ) to the effect that the Minister had a duty to decide on the request for recognition within DATE and set out the principles which the Minister had to take into account when taking this decision . On DATE the applicants submitted further observations and arguments in their favour to the Minister .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister dismissed the applicants\u2019 request . It found that the Jehovah \u2019s Witnesses could not be recognised as a religious society under the CARDINAL Recognition Act because of their unclear internal organisation and their negative attitude towards the ORG and its institutions . Reference was further made to their refusal to perform military service or any form of alternative service for conscientious objectors , to participate in local community life and elections and to undergo certain types of medical treatment such as blood transfusions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint against the Minister \u2019s decision with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG communicated the complaint to the Minister and requested him to submit , within DATE , the case file and any observations he wished to make . The Minister did not respond .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the Minister \u2019s decision of DATE and referred the case back to the Minister . It noted that the Minister had neither filed submissions nor submitted the case file , with the result that the decision had to be taken on the basis of the ORG submissions . The court noted that they had , inter alia , argued that the Minister had taken his decision without a proper investigation , basing it on documents of which the complainants had not been informed and on which they had not been given the opportunity to comment . Since the case file was not available to ORG , this allegation could not have been refuted . ORG therefore concluded that the Minister \u2019s decision was arbitrary and violated the principle of equality ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the Act on ORG ( Bundesgesetz \u00fcber die PERSON religi\u00f6sen GPE , hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) had entered into force . Thus , the Minister found that he had to deal with the applicants\u2019 request for recognition under LAW as a request under section CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW . On DATE the Minister decided that the first applicant had acquired legal personality as a registered religious community within the meaning of LAW as from DATE . That decision was served on the applicants on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants submitted another request to the Federal Minister for recognition of the first applicant as a religious society under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Federal Minister dismissed the request . It found that , pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW , a religious community could only be recognised as a religious society under LAW if it had already existed as a registered religious community for a minimum of DATE . The first applicant , however , did not meet this requirement at the time when the request for recognition was submitted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint against that decision with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint . It found that the DATE waiting period for registered religious communities as a precondition for a successful application for recognition under LAW was in conformity with LAW and referred to its previous decision of DATE ( VfSlg . CARDINAL ) on that issue . The decision was served on the applicants\u2019 lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Further to a request by the applicants , the case was referred to ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG complaint , finding that it concerned in essence questions of the constitutionality and interpretation of section ORG ) of the DATE LAW , which , in the light of ORG ruling of DATE , did not raise a problem in terms of LAW . The Federal Minister had therefore correctly applied that provision . The decision was served on the applicants\u2019 lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , everybody is granted freedom of conscience and belief . The enjoyment of civil and political rights is independent from religious belief ; however , the manifestation of religious belief may not derogate from civic obligations .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that recognised churches and religious communities have the right to manifest their faith collectively in public , to organise and administer their internal affairs independently , to remain in possession of acquired institutions , foundations and funds dedicated to cultural , educational and charitable purposes , however , they are , like all other societies , subordinated to the law .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL entitles the supporters of non - recognised religious communities to domestic manifestation of their faith unless it is unlawful or contra bones mores .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL guarantees to all inhabitants of GPE the right to manifest publicly and privately their thought , religion and beliefs , unless these are incompatible with the protection of public order or morals .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW provides that all religious faiths which have not yet been recognised in the legal order may be recognised as a religious society if they fulfil the conditions set out in the LAW , namely that their teaching , services and internal organisation , as well as the name they choose , do not contain anything unlawful or morally offensive and that the setting up and existence of CARDINAL community of worship ( GPE ) satisfying the statutory criteria is ensured .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provides that if the above conditions are met , recognition is granted by the Minister for Religious Affairs ( LOC ) . ORG has the effect that a religious society obtains legal personality under public law ( juristische Person \u00f6ffentlichen PERSON ) and enjoys all rights which are granted under the legal order to such societies .

Lastly , the statutes must contain provisions on the liquidation of the religious community , ensuring that the assets acquired are not used for ends contrary to religious purposes .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the Federal Minister must refuse to grant legal personality to a religious community if , in view of its teachings or practice , this is necessary in a NORP society in the interests of public safety , for the protection of public order , health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedom of others ; this is in particular the case if its activities involve incitement to commit criminal offences , obstruction of the psychological development of adolescents or undermining of people \u2019s mental integrity , or if the statutes do not comply with section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL , the religious community must inform the Federal Minister for Education and ORG of the name and address of the persons belonging to its official bodies and of any change of its statutes without delay .
