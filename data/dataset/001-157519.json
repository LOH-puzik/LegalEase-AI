The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the events in question the applicant was occasionally working for ORG and also providing information on the latter \u2019s business activities to FAC , an operative officer of ORG ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE PERSON paid a visit to PERSON at the latter \u2019s business headquarters in ORG and asked him to return MONEY ( ORG ) which PERSON had allegedly lent him to help him start his activity . PERSON had previously refused to pay the money back . TIME , an argument broke out among them . PERSON and CARDINAL other individuals kidnapped PERSON and beat him severely to induce him to give up the debt demand . TIME PERSON called the applicant and asked him to come by car to the headquarters to transport someone to PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived TIME , and found PERSON severely beaten and begging PERSON to spare him . The attackers tied the victim up and put him in the boot of his own car . They drove away , murdered PERSON and staged a road accident as cover - up . The applicant arrived at the scene by car and drove the attackers back to their homes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant contacted ORG , who was away on holiday , to tell him what had happened . They met DATE , upon ORG return , and on DATE FAC transmitted the information to the police via his superiors .", "CARDINAL . There was no criminal investigation of the events until DATE , when one of the participants confessed to the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed that accusations had been brought against him , and made a statement to the prosecutor \u2019s office . A lawyer of his choice was present at that meeting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the others involved in the events of DATE were committed for trial on charges of illegal deprivation of liberty and extremely aggravated murder .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout the proceedings the applicant argued that he had infiltrated PERSON \u2019s group as an informant on the behalf of the PERSON . He also stated that PERSON had forced him to participate in the events by threatening him and his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was convicted by ORG of aiding and abetting illegal deprivation of liberty and extremely aggravated murder . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment and removal of certain rights .", "CARDINAL . The court based the conviction on a whole body of evidence , consisting of witness testimony , the statements made by the accused persons during the proceedings , expert examinations and police reports . Based on the evidence in the file , ORG established that the fact for the applicant to come to the ORG \u2019s business headquarters at ORG request and to drive alongside the car where the victim was transported and to drive the culprits back with his car constituted the crimes he was accused of ; the court considered that he had helped the other culprits to commit their crimes .", "CARDINAL . As for the applicant \u2019s connection with the GPE , ORG acknowledged that he was transmitting information on ORG group to officer S.S. It also took note that the PERSON denied that the information about the murder provided by the applicant had been the result of collaboration with the ORG . ORG heard testimony from ORG , who confirmed that both he and the applicant had infiltrated ORG group on behalf of the PERSON . F.B. had been informed by ORG that after DATE it had become too dangerous for the applicant to stay in direct contact with PERSON , because of certain information in the applicant \u2019s possession .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered the Prevention and Combat of Organised Crime Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and decided that the applicant could not benefit from any status as an GPE informant , for the following reasons :", "\u201c Under LAW , in exceptional situations , when there are indications that a crime has been committed or is being planned by members of an organised criminal group , and neither the crime nor its perpetrators can be identified by other methods , informants may be used in order to gather data concerning the commission of crimes and the identification of the perpetrators . No such indication ... existed in the present case and [ the applicant ] was not an informant used for gathering data concerning the crimes of illegal deprivation of liberty and extremely aggravated murder . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also examined and discarded as unfounded the applicant \u2019s allegations of coercion and considered that the applicant could have refused to help or informed the authorities about what was happening . It maintained as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] had the option to leave when , after arriving at the [ scene ] , he realised what was going on , but at no point during the events had he expressed the intention to leave the group . Even assuming that he had only remained in order to collect data for the PERSON , he had had an obligation to inform immediately the police or the GPE about what was happening . From the statements given by the participants , including the applicant himself , it appears that on several occasion [ during TIME , the applicant ] remained alone and could have used his mobile phone to call the police but he did not do it , claiming that the mobile phone keyboard was blocked . However , the court can not accept this explanation , as it is notorious that calling the police phone number is free of charge . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . S.S. gave testimony in the appeal proceedings , and confirmed that he had been informed about the murder by the applicant . He reiterated in detail the events described by the applicant . As for the nature of the collaboration between him and the applicant , ORG explained as follows :", "\u201c My collaboration with [ the applicant ] was based on friendship and I confirm that he is an exceptional man . Our friendship goes back DATE . I knew that [ the applicant ] had relations with a certain group , but the members of the group and its activity was of no interest for the GPE , as it did not concern threats to the national security .", "...", "I expressly declare that I can not give any information about specifically infiltrating [ the applicant ] in [ ORG group , because at that point , the group was not of interest for the national security . \u201d", "CARDINAL . S.S. refused to give details about where he had met with the applicant , asserting that the information requested by the court was classified .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the applicant had taken on his own initiative the role of an GPE informant :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] claimed that he had been infiltrated in ORG \u2019s criminal group by the PERSON , in order to gather data about its activities .", "However , the GPE informed the court , by address no . CARDINAL of DATE ... that the information presented by [ the applicant ] to ORG was not the outcome of any collaboration between that ORG and [ the applicant ] .", "Moreover , the witness S.S. ( an GPE officer ) , declared that PERSON \u2019s criminal group did not constitute threats to national security ... , that being the reason why [ the applicant ] was not requested to gather intelligence about PERSON group .", "It follows that [ the applicant ] took on his own initiative the role of \u201c informant \u201d , without being officially requested to do so , and without being granted permission to participate in crimes for the purpose of gathering intelligence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The decision by ORG was upheld by ORG and ORG on DATE . The High Court increased the sentence to DATE in prison . This decision was final .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant asked for a revision of the final decision . He reiterated that it was impossible to prove before the ordinary courts that he was an GPE informant , as on the one hand the information was classified at the time , and , on the other S.S. risked losing his job if he divulged such information . He requested that the information be declassified . Furthermore , he pointed out that , as the police had failed to act upon the information he had transmitted through the GPE , he could not even benefit from a more lenient sentence , as had been the case with the other participant who had confessed to the crimes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the request was granted in principle by ORG . It considered that the information could constitute relevant evidence which had not been available to the ordinary courts .", "CARDINAL . ORG heard a fresh statement from ORG , who reiterated his previous statements . He further explained that he could not reveal whether the applicant had infiltrated ORG group as an informant , nor could he discuss the nature or content of the information which the applicant had given him , as the law considered it classified information . Nor could he clarify whether , as a general rule , an informant who committed an offence would benefit from protection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE informed ORG that it declassified partially the report drafted by ORG based on the information given by the applicant concerning the crimes ( the report , which contained a description of the facts as presented by the applicant , was adduced to the criminal file ) . It further explained that the document drafted by the applicant himself for ORG had been destroyed after verification of the information contained and communication of that information to the police . It lastly reiterated that the information concerning collaboration with the PERSON was classified under PERSON no . PERSON , \u201c ORG \u201d , and , if revealed , could \u201c severely affect national security \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG made an extensive examination of the evidence in the file and the applicable laws . It acknowledged that the applicant had failed to provide it with conclusive evidence of his status as an GPE informant , but also considered that that situation was not imputable either to him or to the courts . It noted that declassification of documents was left to the discretion of the GPE , which , claiming \u201c national security \u201d , refused to reveal relevant information in the case at hand . Moreover , declassification followed a lengthy and cumbersome procedure , which undermined the rights of the defence as guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . For these reasons , the court considered that given the difficulty of obtaining unequivocal evidence as to the applicant \u2019s status , the incomplete information provided by the ORG and by ORG should be given increased significance in favour of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . It thus concluded that the applicant had participated in the events solely as an ORG informant , and that the representation of his own role and his feelings of fear , horror , despair and repugnance at the scene of the abuse against PERSON removed his criminal responsibility .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on DATE , ORG quashed the previous decisions in part and acquitted the applicant on both counts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting upon an appeal lodged by the prosecutor \u2019s office , ORG quashed that judgment and dismissed the request for revision . It considered that that remedy could not be used solely to adduce new evidence , and that the ordinary courts had already examined the theory according to which the applicant had been a GPE informant who had infiltrated PERSON \u2019s group :", "\u201c Article CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW concerning revision does not refer to newly discovered evidence , because if it were so , revision would become another [ ordinary ] level of jurisdiction ...", "The new facts of circumstances [ required by LAW above as reason for allowing the revision ] will be confirmed by new evidence , but it is not the evidence that constitutes the reason for revision ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also considered that the fact that the status of an ORG informant was not regulated by law made it impossible for the courts to establish the extent of such activities , thus leaving room for abuse of that status . However , reliance of such status could not exonerate from criminal responsibility :", "\u201c As there is no legal frame for regulating the status of an informant for an intelligence service , we can not establish the scope of such a mandate , and thus the opportunity for abusing this status exists .", "The fact that [ the applicant ] \u2019s activity as an informant would have benefitted the PERSON does not exonerate [ the applicant ] from criminal responsibility for criminal acts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant and upheld the decisions rendered by ORG , on similar grounds to those given by the lower court ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
