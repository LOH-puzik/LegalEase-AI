They also stated that PERSON . had quarrelled with the police officers and had brandished a shovel at them .", "CARDINAL . The residents of the applicant 's block of flats testified that PERSON . had not had any weapon and had not fired at the teenagers . The policemen who had been called by the teenagers had been drunk and had behaved rudely . When PERSON . had expressed his intention to leave , the policemen had not tried to stop him . However , subsequently they had decided to enter his flat through the balcony and arrest him . Although all the residents had assured them that PERSON . did not present any danger and had urged them to postpone the inquiry into the incident until TIME , the police officers persisted in their attempt to arrest PERSON . immediately . In the witnesses ' opinion climbing onto the balcony had been inopportune and unnecessary . They had all heard the police officer fire CARDINAL shots . Some of them stated that the first shot had been aimed at PERSON . and the second in the air .", "CARDINAL . One of the applicant 's neighbours , PERSON , stated that on DATE he had been in his flat . He had heard a gunshot and looked out of the window . He had seen a man chasing a group of teenagers .

Mr T. had been examined by the ambulance doctors who had been called to the scene on DATE . The records did not contain any indication that he had been intoxicated .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the prosecutor questioned a ballistic expert who described the bullet trajectory . In particular , she stated that the bullet had gone upwards then ricocheted to the right and back . She also affirmed that a forensic simulation of the incident on the balcony would be inconclusive . It would be impossible to simulate identically the conditions in which the shooting had occurred , for the following reasons : firstly , blank bullets had a different trajectory as compared with live bullets ; secondly , it would be necessary to simulate the position of the person who had fired the shot to within QUANTITY , otherwise the bullet would ricochet differently .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor 's office of Biysk discontinued the criminal proceedings for lack of corpus delicti in Mr T. 's actions .

The case was transferred to the prosecutor 's office of LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor 's office of LOC reconsidered the previous decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings against PERSON . It found that the proceedings should have been discontinued on the ground of lack of corpus delicti in his actions rather than on the ground of his death . There was no evidence that PERSON . had been armed , let alone that he had fired at the teenagers . It followed from the witness statements that he had not offered any resistance to the police officers who had arrived at the scene and that the police officers had not attempted to stop him from leaving . After he had locked himself in his flat he could no longer disturb public order , so PERSON and the other police officers ' attempts to enter his flat through the door or the balcony and arrest him had been unlawful and unjustified . By resisting those attempts PERSON . had been defending his constitutional right to respect for the privacy of his home and his liberty . Mr PERSON . had been found in his underwear , which showed that he had been resting when PERSON had tried to access his balcony . Mr T. 's statement that PERSON . had hit him with a pestle was open to doubt as the pestle had been found in the bedroom rather than on the balcony . Moreover , the expert examination had revealed that the blood on the pestle had been PERSON . Accordingly , PERSON 's actions had not constituted any administrative or criminal offence . Mr T. had abused his office and had unlawfully and unjustifiably used his weapon against Mr Sh .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor 's office of GPE resumed the investigation against Mr T.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted victim status and joined the proceedings as a civil party .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the prosecutor 's office of LOC prepared a bill of indictment . It analysed the collected evidence and concluded that the use of lethal force against PERSON . had not been justified by the circumstances . It found that after receiving the report that PERSON . had fired a shot at the teenagers Mr T. should have verified that information by questioning eyewitnesses to the incident and inspecting the area in search of a cartridge case . He had failed to search the area , however . The eyewitnesses had affirmed that PERSON . did not have any weapon and no weapon had subsequently been found in his flat . In those circumstances , Mr T. could not have had a reasonable suspicion that Mr PERSON . had committed criminal or administrative offences . Moreover , after he had locked himself in his flat he could no longer present any danger to the public . There had therefore been no reason to arrest him . In any event , before proceeding with the arrest , PERSON should have contacted his superior to ask for detailed instructions . He had not done so . Finally , PERSON had had no legal grounds for using his weapon against PERSON . Although PERSON . had indeed showed resistance , he had acted lawfully to protect his legitimate interests , namely , the privacy of his home and his liberty . By attempting to enter PERSON 's flat through the balcony and by shooting him , PERSON had abused his office , had trespassed on PERSON 's home and had committed murder . He had committed criminal offences punishable by ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . The prosecutor also examined the origin of the bruises and abrasions on Mr Sh . 's face and body . Referring to the expert opinion , he concluded that some of the injuries had been the result of PERSON 's falling on the floor after being shot , while the remaining ones had been inadvertently caused when he had been carried to the bedroom by PERSON and another police officer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr T. was committed for trial before ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused to admit the expert opinions of DATE in evidence , as they had been made in the context of criminal proceedings against PERSON . The court commissioned additional expert opinions . The experts conducted their examination and submitted their report in DATE confirming the conclusions drawn by the experts in DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing the accused and the witnesses confirmed their previous statements . The applicant was present at the hearings and made oral submissions to the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted PERSON of all charges . The court was convinced by the teenagers ' and the police officers ' testimony and PERSON statements that Mr Sh . had indeed possessed a gun and had used it , and that he had offered resistance to the police officers who were trying to search him and stop him from escaping to his flat . Although the gun had never been found , the court surmised that Mr Sh . could have thrown it away after he had left the scene . As the prosecution had not searched the surroundings , such a possibility could not be excluded . The court gave the accused the benefit of the doubt and assumed that PERSON . had been armed . More importantly , after questioning the teenagers Mr T. had formed the conviction that PERSON . had been in possession of a weapon and had been a danger to the public . In those circumstances , his decision to arrest Mr PERSON . immediately had been reasonable and justified . As PERSON . had refused to let PERSON in , the applicant had refused to give the key to the police officers and it had been impossible to force the door open , PERSON had taken a correct and lawful decision to climb up onto the balcony . That decision had been approved by the duty officer of LOC of PERSON and the duty officer at ORG police station .", "CARDINAL . The court further found that the use of lethal force had been necessary in the circumstances as PERSON . had offered resistance and put Mr T. 's life in danger . The court established that after PERSON had climbed up the extension fire ladder onto the balcony on the third floor PERSON . had barred his access to the balcony and attempted to throw him down . In accordance with the rules governing the conduct of policemen , PERSON had fired a warning shot . Given that PERSON . had attempted to push him down again , PERSON had fired at him . The court found that PERSON life had been in peril and that he had acted in reasonable self - defence and in compliance with LAW . The court finally noted that an internal inquiry by ORG of LOC had concluded that PERSON had been sober . The court refused to hear a civil claim by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor appealed to ORG . The applicant also lodged an appeal , but ORG refused to hear it , finding that the applicant did not have victim status .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the prosecutor 's appeal and dismissed it . It endorsed the reasoning of the trial court and upheld the acquittal .", "CARDINAL .
