He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE on the suspicion of drug trafficking in substantial quantities .", "On DATE several persons involved in the drug trafficking , CARDINAL of whom was witness C. , were caught with QUANTITY of heroin in GPE and subsequently detained . During C. \u2019s interview by NORP police officers on DATE he incriminated inter alia the applicant giving detailed information about the applicant \u2019s participation in their drug - dealing activities . During a further interview on CARDINAL DATE C. submitted that he \u201c would not accept the statements \u201d of his previous interview , that he \u201c had been under pressure \u201d and that \u201c he had not made those statements \u201d .", "On DATE ORG decided to open the trial against the applicant .", "In DATE and DATE , following a request of ORG , a judge of ORG interviewed ( kommissarische GPE ) inter alia C. , the police officers who had arrested the applicant and CARDINAL of the QUANTITY police officers who had conducted PERSON \u2019s interview on DATE . The interviews of C. and the police officers were held in the presence of the judges of the GPE ORG sitting in the applicant \u2019s case , ORG and the applicant \u2019s defence who had the possibility to ask questions of the witnesses . During his interview C. alleged that the police officers had tortured him to extract the statements given by him on DATE . Furthermore he specified some symptoms which had been the result of his alleged ill - treatment . Subsequently , the judge of ORG decided to reject all further questions concerning the alleged torture as they would not have any influence on the judgment .", "In the meantime , C. had instituted criminal proceedings against the police officers on the grounds of his alleged ill - treatment . On DATE ORG acquitted the police officers of the charges against them as there had been no credible evidence on the basis of which they could have been convicted .", "DATE and DATE ORG held CARDINAL hearings in which the applicant was represented by several lawyers . DATE and DATE ORG repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to summon C. to the hearings and offered to examine him via video conference , but C. rejected that offer . Therefore ORG read out parts of the written records of C. \u2019s statements made during the trial against the police officers before ORG . Furthermore it read out the written records of C. \u2019s interview by the police officers in DATE and of the interview of the police officers by ORG in DATE .", "On DATE the GPE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of importing and trafficking a substantial amount of drugs ( DATE QUANTITY of heroin each time ) and passed a cumulative sentence of DATE imprisonment . Furthermore it ordered the applicant \u2019s preventive detention after the sentence had expired .", "The court found that the applicant had planned and organised the first CARDINAL deliveries of heroin and conducted the heroin business himself as of the sixth delivery . The court set out the reasons for his conviction on CARDINAL pages , thereby relying inter alia on the records of C. \u2019s interview of CARDINAL DATE and on the oral and written submissions of the police officers who had interviewed C. It found that C. \u2019s submissions given during his first interview had been credible . The very general revocation of his first statement however as well as the fact that the other persons who had been arrested together with C. likewise revoked their submissions \u2013 on some occasions even with the same wording DATE and that their submissions converged more and more during the proceedings strongly suggested that they had colluded in relation to their testimonies as to the alleged ill - treatment . C. \u2019s submissions and the statements of his accomplices were highly contradictory as to his alleged torture and the symptoms he had alluded to . Furthermore , it could not be proved from the judgment of ORG , from the statements of C. , the police officers before that court or the various medical reports that C. had in fact been ill - treated . Contrary to the applicant \u2019s submissions and according to reports of ORG and of ORG there is also no general assumption that NORP police officers usually administer torture during their investigations . ORG added that , \u201c in this specific case , the police officers had not had a reason to ill - treat C. as they had already been granted a bonus for having seized the drugs . They thus would not have received any other financial advantage for obtaining further information from ORG or his accomplices \u201d .", "The court , being aware that a large part of the evidence was in fact indirect evidence , further found that the statements of C. and the police officers who had conducted his investigation had been confirmed inter alia by the submissions of witnesses whom the applicant had been able to examine , the content of the applicant \u2019s and other witnesses\u2019 telephone conversations , the flow of money which had resulted from the drug activities and which the applicant had carried out and , finally , by his own submissions which he had modified during trial and adapted according to the respective findings of the court .", "On DATE ORG reduced the conviction to CARDINAL counts but upheld the sentence . It found that there had been no violation of the applicant \u2019s right to question the witness as guaranteed by LAW ( d ) of the LAW . Thus , the applicant \u2019s lawyers had been able to question C. during his interview in DATE where the latter had submitted that he had been subject to torture alluding to several symptoms in this regard . Further relevant new findings in this respect \u2013 a matter which the applicant did not contest \u2013 would not have been a realistic possibility . Moreover , ORG had read out C. \u2019s submissions made during the trial against the police officers , the judgment of ORG and the findings concerning PERSON \u2019s forensic examination . Furthermore , ORG had intensively but unsuccessfully tried to interview C. during one of its oral hearings , but C. had declined ORG offer to hear him via a video conference or to appear personally at the hearing . Finally , ORG had based its findings not only on C. \u2019s submissions , but on the testimony of numerous other witnesses and other means of evidence .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint arguing that the courts had based their findings on different corroborating evidence . In so far as CARDINAL item of evidence alone was insufficient to establish that the applicant had committed the crime , the trial court had drawn its conclusions in a comprehensive and consistent manner from the entirety of the evidence at its disposal . Furthermore , the trial court had elaborated extensively on the question as to whether C. \u2019s testimony could be used as evidence and had examined the credibility of C. \u2019s submissions concerning his alleged torture . Finally , the defence had had the possibility to question C. during his interview before ORG . The fact that single questions had not been admitted was not open to objection as it was the procedural law of the state where the interview had taken place which decided on how to conduct the latter .", "On DATE ORG rejected the motion of the applicant \u2019s lawyer to be granted access to the case files relating to proceedings concerning the forfeiture ( GPE ) of the applicant \u2019s assets .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW read in conjunction with section CARDINALa of LAW prohibits methods of examination which impair the witness \u2019s freedom to determine and to exercise his or her will , such as ill - treatment , induced fatigue , physical interference , the administration of drugs , torment , deception , hypnosis or coercion and the threat of such measures . Statements obtained in violation of this prohibition may not be used , even if the witness has given his or her consent .", "Pursuant to the provisions of LAW , a witness shall be examined in person at the main hearing if the proof of a fact in issue is based on that person \u2019s observation . In principle , the witness \u2019s examination may not be replaced by reading out the record of a previous examination or by reading out a written statement ( Section CARDINAL of the said Code ) . According to the constant case - law of ORG , Section CARDINAL permits the hearing of witnesses giving hearsay evidence .", "As an exception to the above - mentioned principle , the examination of a witness or co - accused may be replaced by reading out the written record of his previous examination by a judge . This is permitted if there are insurmountable impediments preventing the witness or co - accused from attending the main hearing for a long or indefinite period of time ( Section CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of the said Code ) .", "The public prosecutor , the defendant and defence counsel have the right to be present at the examination of a witness by a judge outside the main hearing ( Section CARDINALc \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) . A defendant who is detained and is represented by counsel is only entitled to be present at hearings of witnesses conducted at the court of the place where he is in custody ( Section CARDINALc \u00a7 CARDINAL of the said Code ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
