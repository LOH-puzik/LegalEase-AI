By law , all CARDINAL submissions fell to be examined at first instance by the ORG . Those made to the ORG and ORG were therefore transmitted to the ORG on CARDINAL May and DATE , respectively .", "CARDINAL . As the ORG did not grant the request formulated in the CARDINAL submissions , they fell to be judicially examined by ORG , to which they were transmitted on CARDINAL and DATE , respectively .", "CARDINAL . By way of a submission dated CARDINAL DATE , which was received by ORG on DATE , the applicant expressed objections to the handling of his case by ORG judge who was handling his detention case at first - instance , which ORG interpreted as a challenge to the judge on the grounds of bias .", "CARDINAL .

Later on DATE , the investigator asked the applicant to appoint a lawyer within DATE , failing which a lawyer would be appointed for him by the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was heard before ORG . He submitted that it was his intention to appoint a lawyer , that the DATE timescale allowed him for that purpose had been unrealistically short , and that he disagreed with having a lawyer appointed for him by court .", "CARDINAL . In the circumstances \u2012 as legal representation was mandatory \u2012 the public session scheduled for later on DATE had to be cancelled .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , on DATE , that is on DATE , the applicant also made a written submission containing his arguments and waiving his right to have the request for release examined in a public session .", "CARDINAL .

In addition , it observed that ORG judgment referred to by the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had not yet been published in LAW . Its rulings had thus not entered into force yet and ORG status was not compromised for the time being . Moreover , ORG explained in detail why it considered the applicant \u2019s detention necessary and why his release in return for a pledge of lawful conduct was not acceptable .", "CARDINAL . By way of an interlocutory appeal lodged by both the applicant \u2019s lawyer and the applicant himself , the applicant challenged the decision of CARDINAL DATE to dismiss his request for release .", "The appeal lodged by his lawyer was dated DATE , was addressed to ORG , reached its addressee on DATE , and was transmitted to ORG on DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s own appeal was dated DATE , was addressed directly to ORG , and was received there on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the same time as lodging the appeal , the applicant challenged the entire criminal - law bench of ORG on grounds of bias , once again relying on ORG judgment mentioned above ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the challenge . Prior to this decision , all the ORG judges concerned had been asked to state a position in respect of the challenge and a special chamber had been appointed to rule on it .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant filed a complaint under LAW of LAW ( Constitutional Law no . PERSON . , as amended ) with ORG . The complaint was directed against ORG ( \u0160pecializovan\u00fd trestn\u00fd s\u00fad ) , which had by then come into being as the legal successor to ORG , and also against ORG and the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Relying on LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW and its constitutional equivalents , he argued that his request for release had not been determined by an independent tribunal , that its dismissal had not been supported by adequate reasoning , that he had arbitrarily been denied his right to release pending trial , and that his request had not been determined \u201c speedily \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In terms of relief , the applicant requested that the decisions of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE be quashed , that his release be ordered , and that he be awarded MONEY ( ORG ) by way of compensation for nonpecuniary damage , plus reimbursement of his legal costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible for being in essence manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . As to the complaint about the alleged failure to achieve a speedy determination of the applicant \u2019s request , ORG observed , in particular , that the delay in serving the ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE on his lawyer of choice and the applicant himself ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was due to the facts that the lawyer of the applicant \u2019s choice had only announced his appointment to the police , that this information had accordingly had to be transmitted to the court , which had taken some time , and that the prosecution service had failed to inform the court that , at the given time , the applicant had been transferred to a prison other than the CARDINAL known to the court , as a consequence of which the decision had been sent to a wrong address and had had to be sent again .", "CARDINAL . Examining separately the proceedings before ORG and ORG and the involvement of the ORG , ORG concluded that , taking into account all the circumstances , there had been no delays attributable to the authorities that had reached a constitutionally relevant threshold . From that perspective , ORG considered that any delays resulting from the applicant \u2019s challenges alleging bias had been imputable to him and that the relevance of the delays in serving the ORG decision of DATE on the applicant ( on DATE ) \u2012 which had been due to a lack of coordination among the authorities concerned \u2012 had been diminished by the service of that decision on the lawyer of the applicant \u2019s choice on CARDINAL DATE .", "The written version of ORG decision was served on the applicant on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4", "5-5"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
