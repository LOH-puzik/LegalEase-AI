The applicants , PERSON , FAC , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON GPE and Mr PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively , and live in GPE . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and Highways expropriated CARDINAL plots of land belonging to the applicants in the Seymen village of GPE , for a highway construction . The ORG assessed the value of the land and paid the applicants CARDINAL NORP Liras ( GPE ) per square CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , i.e. , within the DATE prescription period , the applicants brought an action before ORG for increased compensation , requesting CARDINAL TRL per square metre .", "CARDINAL . The court appointed a committee of experts , who conducted an on - site property inspection on DATE . They found that the land had been significantly undervalued and assessed it at CARDINAL TRL per square metre .", "CARDINAL . Given the considerable discrepancy between this evaluation and that of the administration , the court appointed another committee of experts . This new committee conducted an examination on DATE and valued the land at CARDINAL TRL per square metre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed a petition with the same court for \u201c amendment \u201d ( \u0131slah ) of their claim . They argued that they had been unaware of the real value of their property revealed by the expert reports . On that basis , they requested that their original claim be increased to CARDINAL TRL per square metre , relying on the lower of the CARDINAL expert assessments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court denied the request . It held that the petition had been filed outside of the CARDINAL-day period stipulated for expropriation - related compensation cases .", "CARDINAL . Ruling on the merits , the court first examined the expert reports . It found that they were consistent with the evidence in the case file as well as the records of the mayor \u2019s office . It further found that they had duly taken into account the factors affecting the value of the expropriated property .", "CARDINAL . Nonetheless , the court disregarded the experts\u2019 valuations . It reasoned that both assessments exceeded the ORG claim , and thus , it sufficed to award the amount of compensation originally claimed . It also explained that it was unnecessary to require a third expert valuation with a view to reconciling DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . They relied on a ORG decision dated DATE . The decision had reviewed the constitutionality of the last sentence of LAW , which read as follows :", "\u201c LAW : The plaintiff can not increase his claim through amendment ( \u0131slah ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Declaring that sentence unconstitutional and a nullity , ORG had reasoned :", "\u201c The [ local ] court requesting the review maintained that the impugned rule was contrary to LAW as it forces plaintiffs to initiate a new case and unduly burdens the judiciary .", "...", "By not allowing a claim to be increased through amendment , the impugned rule prevents cases from being resolved as promptly and cost - effectively as possible , and thereby violates LAW .", "...", "The rule that prevents plaintiffs from increasing their original claims through \u2018 amendment\u2019 is contrary to the principle of the rule of law as it makes it unduly difficult to claim a right .", "...", "The impugned rule forces a plaintiff to reinitiate the case from the very beginning and as such , it restricts the freedom to seek a legal remedy .", "...", "As the rule prevents plaintiffs from receiving redress as promptly and costeffectively as possible , it significantly impedes the freedom to seek a legal remedy , which is irreconcilable with the requirements of a NORP society ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the civil court \u2019s judgment . It relied on a different reasoning . Instead of discussing whether or not the petition for \u201c amendment \u201d had been filed on time , it held that :", "\u201c By requesting QUANTITY , the plaintiffs have bound themselves . They are not allowed to increase that amount even through amendment .", "The fact that the last sentence of LAW had been nullified by ORG has no applicability in this particular context . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the decision was notified to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW :", "\u201c Article CARDINAL : ... It is the duty of the judiciary to conclude trials as quickly as possible and at minimum expense . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In a case concerning the plaintiff \u2019s inability to increase his claim through amendment ( \u0131slah ) ( file no . CARDINAL , decision no . CARDINAL ) , ORG ruled , in its judgment dated DATE , that the plaintiff was bound by his original claim . In its opinion , the fact that ORG annulled LAW did not give the plaintiff a new right as long as he did not bring a partial action ( k\u0131smi dava ) . Under NORP law , a \u201c partial action \u201d was brought when the plaintiff made a partial claim and stated in his petition that he reserved his further rights , i.e. the right to increase his claim .", "CARDINAL . In a case concerning the plaintiff \u2019s request for pecuniary and nonpecuniary compensation for having suffered bodily harm ( file no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision no . CARDINAL ) , ORG of ORG held , in its judgment DATE , that if the plaintiff did not reserve his further rights and bring a \u201c partial action \u201d he could not increase his claim by way of amendment ( \u0131slah ) . It further stated that any plaintiff who did not reserve his further rights when bringing an action must be considered to have forfeited them and that this forfeiture could not be altered through amendment .", "CARDINAL . In a case concerning the plaintiff \u2019s request to increase his claim through amendment ( file no . CARDINAL , decision no . CARDINAL ) , the CARDINALth Chamber of ORG ruled in its judgment of DATE that an amendment would only be possible should the plaintiff make such a request within the statutory time - limit . In this case , having found that the plaintiff \u2019s request for increased compensation was time - barred , the court concluded that the amendment request must be dismissed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
