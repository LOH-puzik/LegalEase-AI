CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Access to court)", "JUDGES": "Jon Fridrik Kj\u00f8lbro;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Paul Lemmens;Georges Ravarani;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in inheritance proceedings following the applicant \u2019s grandmother \u2019s death , the applicant \u2019s relative , PERSON , and the applicant \u2019s father were declared the beneficiaries in respect of a house , which was not registered in the land register , by a decision of ORG ( PERSON u NORP ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON brought a civil action against the applicant in ORG ( PERSON u PERSON ) asking that court to recognise his ownership of a share of CARDINAL of an inherited piece of property and to order the applicant to allow him to register his ownership in the land register . He set the value of the dispute ( vrijednost predmeta spora ) at CARDINAL NORP kunas ( HRK ) .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before the first - instance court , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant contested the value of the dispute and suggested that it be set at HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing held on DATE the applicant , inter alia , withdrew her objection to the value of the dispute as indicated by the claimant , and stated that she agreed with it .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE the ORG accepted PERSON \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( PERSON u PERSON ) and on DATE the second - instance court dismissed her appeal as ill - founded , upholding the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( PERSON ) , challenging the lower courts\u2019 judgments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law inadmissible ratione valoris . It interpreted PERSON \u2019s civil action as being composed of CARDINAL separate claims arising from different factual and legal bases - the first one for recognition of ownership , and the second for obtaining an order securing the registration of his ownership in the land register ( hereinafter \u201c the issuance of a clausula intabulandi \u201d ) . ORG thus halved the value of the dispute and held that the value of each claim did not reach the necessary ratione valoris threshold of HRK CARDINAL ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) for an appeal on points of law to be admissible . The relevant part of this decision reads as follows :", "\u201c The claimant in his civil action indicated the value of the dispute as HRK CARDINAL .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CPA [ ( LAW ) ] , if the claims in the civil action arise from a variety of grounds , or different claimants put forward individual claims or individual claims are raised against several defendants , the value of the dispute must be established in accordance with the value of each individual claim .", "In the instant case the claimant made CARDINAL non - monetary claims , CARDINAL concerning property rights - for recognition of ownership - , and a claim under the law on obligations - for the issuance of a clausula intabulandi , namely for obtaining an order securing registration of his ownership in the land register . Therefore , the value of the dispute has to be established in relation to the value of the dispute of each claim . Consequently , the value of the dispute of each claim ... has to be established by dividing the indicated unique value of the dispute by [ these ] CARDINAL [ claims ] .", "Given that the claimant indicated the [ unique ] value of the dispute as HRK CARDINAL , and that this amount should be divided by [ the number of the claims ] , the value of the dispute of each claim does not exceed the amount of CARDINAL . It follows that an appeal on points of law by the defendant is inadmissible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) , arguing that PERSON \u2019s action had CARDINAL aspects which could not be separated , and that ORG decision finding that the case concerned CARDINAL separate claims had therefore been arbitrary and had violated her right to a fair hearing , in particular her right of access to ORG , as guaranteed under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . It held that the applicant in her constitutional complaint \u201c did not demonstrate that ORG had failed to respect the provisions of the LAW concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms , namely that it had applied relevant law in an arbitrary manner \u201d and that therefore \u201c the present case did not raise a constitutional issue . \u201d Its decision was served on the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
