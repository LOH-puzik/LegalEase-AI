The conditions of detention in the different places of detention are a matter of contention ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that the proceedings before the ORG are adversarial in nature . It is therefore for the parties to substantiate their factual arguments by providing the ORG with the necessary evidence . Whereas the ORG is responsible for establishing the facts , it is up to the parties to provide active assistance by supplying it with all the relevant information . In this context , the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account ( Lisnyy and others v. GPE and GPE DATE . ) , ORG . ORG GPE , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE , with further references ) .", "CARDINAL . In cases in which there are conflicting accounts of events , the ORG is inevitably confronted with the same difficulties as those faced by any first - instance court when establishing the facts . As to facts in dispute , the ORG reiterates its jurisprudence requiring a standard of proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d in its assessment of evidence . Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact ( Aslakhanova and Others v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE , with further references ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , it is to be recalled that Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio ( ORG v. the former GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . Under certain circumstances the ORG has borne in mind the difficulties associated with obtaining evidence and the fact that often little evidence can be submitted by the applicants in support of their applications ( NORP v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) . According to the ORG \u2019s settled case - law , in these cases it is for the applicant to make only a prima facie case and to adduce appropriate evidence . If , in response to such allegations made by the applicants , the ORG then fail to disclose crucial documents to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation , strong inferences may be drawn . The prima facie threshold is reached primarily on the basis of witness statements , including the ORG submission to the ORG and to domestic authorities , and other evidence ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE , with further references ) . However , where the applicants fail to make a prima facie case , the burden of proof can not be reversed ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 QUANTITY , with further references ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has already found that these considerations apply to disappearances examined under LAW , where , although it has not been proved that a person has been taken into custody by the authorities , it is possible to establish that he or she was officially summoned by the authorities , entered a place under their control and has not been seen since . In such circumstances , the onus is on the Government to provide a plausible and satisfactory explanation as to what happened on the LOC and to show that the person concerned was not detained by the authorities , but left the LOC without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty . Furthermore , the ORG reiterates that , again in the context of a complaint under LAW , it has required proof in the form of concordant inferences before the burden of proof is shifted to ORG ( see PERSON , cited above , LAW , with further references ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that it concluded in GPE v. GPE ( I ) ( cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) that from DATE a coordinated policy of arresting , detaining and expelling NORP nationals had been put in place in GPE , which had amounted to an administrative practice . While the ORG does not suggest that at that time all NORP nationals were arrested or detained in GPE , it nevertheless finds it appropriate to apply the principles concerning reversing the burden of proof to the present case . Nonetheless , where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case , no strong inferences will be drawn and proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d would be required .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants their then DATE son had been detained for TIME at the PERSON district police department on DATE and he was only released after the payment of a bribe . The applicants also indicated that their belongings , which they had to leave behind in GPE , included a car .", "CARDINAL . The Government objected to the allegation of the detention of the ORG son and stated that an inquiry by the prosecutor \u2019s offices had not produced any proof for this allegation . The ORG also indicated that no vehicle was registered in the name of the applicants in the database of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that the applicants\u2019 submission was of a general nature and lacked several important details , such as the exact time of the detention , the amount of the paid bribe , the make , model or registration number of the car ( see , a contrario , PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The ORG also notes that the applicants did neither submit any documents or witness statements regarding the alleged detention of their son and the ownership of the car nor have they informed the ORG of any attempts they may have made in order to obtain at least fragmentary documentary evidence to substantiate their allegations ( see Lisnyy and others , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Accordingly , the ORG finds that the applicants have not made a prima facie case and that the information in the ORG \u2019s possession does not suffice to establish that the ORG son had been detained on DATE or that the applicants had to leave behind their car ( see , mutatis mutandis , PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that on or CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE she was arrested by police officers and brought to ORG , where she was detained for DATE . Due to health issues , according to the applicant half her body had become paralysed , she was released on TIME . On DATE she left GPE by aeroplane .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that neither ORG nor ORG had any records or information about the placement of the applicant in any detention facility .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that the applicant alleges a detention in a not closer specified police station . The ORG also notes that the applicant was not able to provide the exact date of her arrest and that she did not submit any medical certificate regarding her paralysis , which was allegedly the reason for her release . Having regard to these uncertainties , the ORG finds that the applicant has neither made a prima facie case nor that the applicant \u2019s detention has been established beyond reasonable doubt ( see , mutatis mutandis , Lisnyy and others , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant he was arrested on DATE by officers of the migration authorities and was brought to ORG for the Serpokhova district of GPE , where he was kept for CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was taken to an unspecified ORG in GPE , which ordered his detention and expulsion . Subsequently the applicant was transferred to the Serpokhova special detention centre , where he was detained until his expulsion . On DATE the applicant was taken by bus to GPE airport and he was flown , by cargo plane , to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that neither ORG nor ORG had any records or information about the placement of the applicant in any detention facility . It further indicated that a PERSON temporary detention centre does not exist .", "CARDINAL . The Government provided several documents with regard to administrative proceedings concerning the applicant . These include an administrative offence report from the NORP district dated DATE , indicating the applicant \u2019s arrest on DATE at TIME and a decision of ORG of LOC , also dated DATE , fining the applicant ( RUB CARDINAL ) for not observing the applicable registration procedure , and ordering the applicant \u2019s expulsion . The ORG decision also indicates that the applicant shall be held at FAC of PERSON until his expulsion . Furthermore , the judgment shows a stamp of NORP airport , dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the material in its possession , the ORG finds it established that the applicant was arrested on DATE and taken to the NORP police station , where he was held for one and a half hours . Subsequently the applicant was brought before ORG , which fined the applicant and ordered his detention and expulsion . The applicant was then detained until DATE in the Reception Centre of NORP . On DATE the applicant was taken by bus to GPE airport and was then flown , by cargo plane , to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that on DATE they were stopped by police officers in the street next to the GPE pole metro station in GPE for identity checks . Subsequently they were taken to ORG for the NORP district of GPE . After TIME they were transferred to a special detention centre in the ORG district . After DATE in the detention centre they were , for the first time , allowed to call their mother and were able to ask her to buy aeroplane tickets for them . After the applicants\u2019 mother had done so and presented the aeroplane tickets to the officers of the detention centre , the applicants were released . On DATE the applicants left GPE by aeroplane from GPE airport in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that an inquiry into the alleged detention in ORG for NORP and ORG districts of GPE did not confirm the applicants\u2019 version of events . According to the Government the applicants had not been brought to the police station of LOC of GPE either , as that police station was closed for reconstruction at the relevant time . Lastly , the Government submitted that no criminal proceedings were instigated against the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the applicants have submitted copies of their passports , showing that they left NORP territory on DATE , in support of their application . However , the ORG also observes that the applicants have not submitted any documents , such as the aeroplane tickets and the receipts of the purchase , or witness statements , such as from their mother , corroborating their submission regarding their detention and release . Under these circumstances the ORG finds it unable to conclude that the applicants have made a prima face case . Consequently , the burden of proof can not be reversed and fully shifted to the Government ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 QUANTITY , with further references ) . The ORG considers it not established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicants had been detained DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant \u2019s submission , on DATE CARDINAL police officers of ORG of ORG visited him at home and checked his identity documents . Owing to him being NORP and under the pretence that he was suspected of theft , he was taken to the NORP police station , where he was identified in an identity parade by the theft victim . Subsequently he was detained and only after the intervention of one of the applicant \u2019s friends , who worked for ORG , his involvement in the alleged theft was cleared up and the investigation was dropped . The applicant was nonetheless not released but kept in a cell of the police station TIME . On DATE he was transferred to the special detention centre in the LOC district in GPE , where he was detained until DATE , when ORG of Moscow Region discontinued proceedings against the applicant for not observing the registration procedure . DATE the applicant was stopped by CARDINAL men in plainclothes on the highway , who forced the applicant into their car and put a hood over his head . After TIME drive , the applicant was led to an unspecified police station and placed in a cell . On DATE of detention in the police station the applicant was handed a decision of ORG , ordering his expulsion and fining the applicant ( RUB CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .

The Government submitted that the applicant was apprehended on DATE by officers of ORG of the GPE district of GPE and was brought before LOC on DATE . The court fined the applicant for not observing the applicable registration procedure and ordered the applicant \u2019s expulsion . The ORG also stated that neither ORG nor ORG had any records or information about any subsequent detention of the applicant and that the applicant was not forcibly removed from GPE , but left on his own on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted inter alia the decision of ORG of GPE Region of DATE and of ORG of DATE . The ORG submitted in addition to the decision of ORG , reports concerning the arrest and detention of the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that the applicant has not submitted any proof concerning his detention from CARDINAL to DATE and from DATE to DATE , and that his submission concerning the second alleged detention is partially fragmentary . The ORG also notes that ORG did not order the applicant \u2019s subsequent detention in CARDINAL of ORG , as the NORP courts did in other cases . Accordingly the ORG considers the information submitted by the applicant insufficient to conclude that he has made a prima facie case . Therefore , the burden of proof can not be reversed and shifted to the Government ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 QUANTITY , with further references ) . The ORG considers it not established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had been detained DATE . However , based on the information and documents provided by the ORG , the ORG concludes that the applicant had been detained in ORG of the GPE district of GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE she received a call from the ORG , informing her that there were problems with her passport and that she had to go to ORG . When she went there DATE , she was notified about a decision to expel her , owing to her visa - related offence in DATE . On DATE she returned to the passport department to prove that she was an internally deplaced person and had a right to stay in GPE .
