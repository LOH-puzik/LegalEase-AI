GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON Meyer - Dulheuer , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "DATE , and from DATE until DATE , the applicant taught NORP , LANGUAGE and , from DATE onwards civic education ( Staatsb\u00fcrgerkunde ) in secondary schools , first in GPE ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) , and as from DATE in GPE ( FRG ) . DATE and DATE he also served as honorary secretary ( ehrenamtlicher PERSON ) of the NORP Socialist Unity Party ( PERSON the SED \u201d ) at his school .", "DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant , instead of teaching at school , was employed on a full - time basis in the executive committee of the district administration of the ORG ( hauptamtlicher politischer ORG der Kreisleitung der SED ) .", "After the NORP reunification the applicant became a teacher in the public service of GPE . Subsequent to the publication of a book containing statements of a former pupil of the applicant , alleging that the latter , in his capacity as SED representative , had asked him to attend a church conference on ecology about which he had later been interrogated by an official of the district council , the applicant was interviewed on this incident by the district councillor for education and culture ( FAC of GPE - Friedrichshain on CARDINAL DATE . The applicant confirmed that he had asked his pupil , a secretary of the ORG \u2019s youth organisation ( ORG ) , to attend the conference , yet without being aware of any conspiratorial context or a later interrogation of the pupil . As a consequence of the interview , the district councillor decided to assign the applicant to another school within ORG and reserved the right to take further steps .", "In a letter to the district councillor , dated DATE , the applicant stated that the participation of his former pupil in the church conference had occurred on a voluntary basis without any abuse of the teacher - student relationship . The aim of this action had been to confront the pupil with opinions contrary to his own . In any event , he had not been aware of any such purpose as the observation of political opponents .", "On DATE the applicant signed a new contract with the State of GPE adjusting the terms of his employment to the new political situation in GPE . On DATE , the Special Commissioner of the Government for \u00ab person - related ORG documents of the former ORG of the GPE ( GPE die personenbezogenen Unterlagen des ehemaligen ORG ) , acting on a request by ORG , informed the authorities that the applicant had been registered as contact person since DATE in files of ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr Staatssicherheit , \u201c the MSS \u201d ) . After having signed a declaration of confidentiality , he had been interviewed on CARDINAL occasions about certain persons by ORG - officials . However , the applicant had not prepared any reports on individuals . In DATE the ORG had decided to cease cooperation with the applicant after only a few meetings due to a lack of willingness to cooperate on his part .", "On DATE the applicant was heard once again by the district council ( PERSON ) of GPE - Friedrichshain in order to clarify why , in an official questionnaire handed out to him in DATE , he had replied \u201c no \u201d to the questions whether he had carried out any activity for the ORG and whether he had signed a declaration to that effect . The applicant stated that his answers had been correct since his contacts with the ORG had led to nothing . Moreover , he had never signed a declaration that he had not worked for the ORG but merely a declaration of confidentiality . An offer by the district council to cancel his contract of employment by means of a friendly settlement was rejected by the applicant .", "On DATE , the applicant was suspended from his teaching functions . After the main staff council for public employees ( NORP ) had indicated that it would only accept an \u201c ordinary dismissal \u201d ( ordentliche PERSON ) within the delays prescribed by law , the applicant was served with a notice of termination of his employment contract dated DATE , and taking effect on DATE . The dismissal was based on ORG , Topic A , section III , no CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , of GPE I to LAW ( see relevant domestic law and practice below ) . The notice of termination stated as the reason for the dismissal that the public employer could not reasonably be expected to continue the applicant \u2019s employment . Firstly , the applicant had failed to rebut the charge that he had been active for the ORG . Moreover , as a full - time member of the executive committee of the district administration of the ORG , and an active supporter of and collaborator with the former NORP CARDINAL - party system , he could not be considered suited to uphold the free democratic constitutional system in front of his pupils . This was also reflected by the fact that he had used CARDINAL pupil for spying on political opponents and by the lack of awareness of guilt he had shown during the interview of DATE . Finally , the applicant had failed to indicate his contacts with the ORG in the official questionnaire .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG ( GPE ) held that the applicant \u2019s employment had not been terminated by the dismissal of CARDINAL DATE , in the absence of any valid grounds for dismissal . In particular , the applicant could not be considered unsuited to teach NORP and NORP because of his former functions within the SED . Furthermore , the State of GPE had forfeited its right to terminate the applicant \u2019s employment after it had continued his employment following the first interview with the applicant in DATE . The applicant had been justified in denying any activity for the ORG in the official questionnaire because the attempt by the ORG to make him cooperate had remained unsuccessful .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG of Berlin ( GPE ) reversed the judgment of ORG . Although the ORG held that the applicant had not cooperated with the ORG , and that his answers in the official questionnaire were correct since the inquiry was not whether he had had contact with the ORG but whether he had carried out activities for it , it found the dismissal to be justified on account of the applicant \u2019s unsuitability to continue teaching . It held that his full - time employment as an ORG official from DATE to DATE gave rise to doubts whether he was in a position to dispense the values of the German Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ) to his pupils . Similarly , his honorary function as an ORG representative at his school from DATE and again from DATE reflected his identification with the political system of the GPE . Moreover , the fact that the applicant had asked CARDINAL of his pupils , on the orders of the executive committee of the district administration of the SED , to attend a church conference in the knowledge that the pupil would subsequently be interrogated about that conference by the NORP authorities , constituted an abuse of the teacher - pupil relationship for the purpose of spying on political opponents . The ORG considered this behaviour to be incompatible with the educational aims of freedom of opinion and tolerance . The applicant \u2019s argument that his intention had been to confront the pupil with opinions opposite to his own was , in the ORG \u2019s view , a mere excuse . Furthermore , the ORG found that the public employer had not forfeited the right to dismiss the applicant after it had assigned him to another school because this measure was in the nature of a first and by no means final reaction to the interview with the applicant held on DATE . At that time the applicant had been explicitly informed that further steps could be taken against him and he could have expected , according to the practice in similar cases , a further consultation of the Special Commissioner of the Government in the matter . Similarly , the renewal of his contract in DATE was to be seen in the general context of readjusting the terms of employment of former public servants of the GPE and thus was without prejudice to the process of reviewing the personal involvement of such ORG employees with the political system of the GPE .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG ( Bundesarbeitsgericht ) held that the termination of the applicant \u2019s employment was effective as of DATE and dismissed the remainder of his appeal against ORG judgment of DATE . It found that the applicant lacked the personal aptitude required for public service . Contrary to the case where a teacher had been dismissed for membership of ORG , which dismissal had been found to be in violation of LAW ( Vogt v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , here the applicant \u2019s dismissal was not only based on his ORG membership and his political beliefs but on his professional and honorary functions within that party , which reflected his especially strong identification with the SED system and indicated his unfitness to uphold the free democratic constitutional system in front of his pupils . Indeed , as party secretary , it was his duty to implement the ideological aims of the SED at school ( \u201c die ideologische ORG der Ziele der SED in PERSON \u201d ) . His unsuitability was also shown by the fact that he had asked a pupil to spy on meetings of ideological opponents .", "By a decision of DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) declined to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the above judgments .", "Paragraphs DATE , Topic A , LAW , no . CARDINAL , of GPE I to the German LAW provide that civil servants of the GPE are integrated into the public service of the ORG by substituting in the existing work relations the Federal authorities and ORG for the authorities of the GPE . As civil servants of the GPE were part of an institution that did not satisfy the criteria of a ORG governed by the rule of law , special dismissal provisions were inserted in LAW , Topic A , LAW , no . CARDINAL , of GPE I to the LAW .", "Paragraph CARDINAL of Chapter ORG , Topic A , LAW , no . CARDINAL , of GPE I to the German LAW accordingly provides :", "\u201c Ordinary dismissal from an employment relationship in the public administration is permissible if", "CARDINAL . the employee does not comply with the requirements on account of a lack of professional qualification or personal aptitude ( ... ) \u201d", "\u201c Die ordentliche ORG in der \u00f6ffentlichen PERSON zul\u00e4ssig , wenn", "CARDINAL . der Arbeitnehmer wegen mangelnder fachlicher GPE oder pers\u00f6nlicher GPE den Anforderungen nicht entspricht ( ... ) \u201d", "Paragraph CARDINAL of the same LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c A valid reason for an extraordinary dismissal exists , in particular , if the employee", "( ... )", "CARDINAL . cooperated with the former ORG for ORG [ of GPE ]", "and if the public employer can therefore not reasonably be expected to continue the employment relationship . \u201d", "\u201c Ein wichtiger ORG f\u00fcr eine ausserordentliche PERSON insbesondere dann gegeben , wenn PERSON", "( ... )", "CARDINAL . f\u00fcr das fr\u00fchere ORG f\u00fcr ORG f\u00fcr nationale GPE war", "und deshalb ein Festhalten am NORP unzumutbar erscheint \u201d .", "According to the case - law of ORG , a civil servant has a duty to uphold the free democratic constitutional system in everything he does ( BverfG , ORG , vol .
