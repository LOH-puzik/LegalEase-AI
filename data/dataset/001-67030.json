The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "In DATE , at DATE , the applicant completed his training as a navigation officer at ORG and started work as a seaman . This he continued to do until DATE , when he sustained a serious work accident on board a trawler . His right leg was struck by a QUANTITY stone object , causing a compound fracture of his ankle . As a result , he had to give up work as a seaman . His disability was assessed at PERCENT , which made him eligible for a disability pension from ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , to which he paid premiums intermittently from DATE until DATE . The assessment was made on the basis of the criteria that applied under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of ORG ( Law no . TIME \u201c the DATE LAW ) , notably that the claimant was unable to carry out the work he had performed before his disability , that his participation in the ORG had been intended to insure against this contingency , and that he had a sustained loss of fitness for work ( of PERCENT or more ) .", "The applicant underwent regular disability assessments by a physician accredited by ORG and was each time assessed PERCENT disabled in relation to his previous job .", "CARDINAL . After his accident the applicant joined a transport company , ORG , as an office assistant , and is still employed there as head of the claims department .", "CARDINAL . In DATE LAW was amended by DATE of PERSON no . MONEY ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which considerably altered the basis for the assessment of disability in that the assessment was to be based not on the Pension Fund beneficiaries\u2019 inability to perform the same work but work in general . The new provisions had been enacted on the initiative of ORG and in view of the ORG \u2019s financial difficulties ( according to an audit , at DATE the Pension Fund had a deficit of CARDINAL NORP kr\u00f3nur ( ISK ) ) . ORG applied the new provisions not only to persons who had claimed a disability pension after the date of their entry into force but also to persons who were already in receipt of a disability pension before DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under an interim provision in DATE , the above change to the reference criteria was not to apply for DATE after the commencement of the CARDINAL LAW to a person who , before its entry into force , was already receiving a disability pension .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the new rules , a fresh assessment of the applicant \u2019s disability was carried out by an officially accredited ORG physician , who concluded that the applicant \u2019s loss of capacity for work in general was PERCENT , and thus did not reach the minimum level of PERCENT . As a result , from DATE onwards ORG stopped paying the applicant the disability pension and related child benefits he had been receiving for DATE since the accident in DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to information obtained by the Government from ORG and submitted to ORG , the applicant had been CARDINAL of CARDINAL Fund members who were receiving disability pensions in DATE under the interim provision in section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE the total number of disability pension recipients was CARDINAL . This included ORG members who had not become entitled to a disability pension until after the commencement of the DATE Act in DATE . The cases of the aforementioned CARDINAL persons receiving disability pensions from the ORG , who had acquired their entitlement before that time and were still drawing disability pensions in DATE , were reviewed in DATE and DATE in the light of their capacity for work in general . Altogether , ORG members of this group of disability pensioners had their benefits reduced in DATE as a result of the new rules on disability assessment under LAW . In the case of ORG members , including the applicant , the disability rating for work in general did not reach the level of PERCENT required under LAW to retain entitlement to disability benefit , and so benefit payments were discontinued . The disability ratings of CARDINAL members were reduced from PERCENT and those of CARDINAL members from PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . The applicant instituted proceedings against ORG and , in the alternative , against both the ORG and ORG , challenging the ORG \u2019s decision to discontinue the payments to him . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found for the defendants .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , which by a judgment of DATE upheld the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG accepted that the applicant \u2019s pension rights under LAW were protected by the relevant provisions of LAW as property rights . However , it considered that the measures taken by virtue of LAW had been justified by ORG financial difficulties . ORG stated :", "\u201c The pension rights that the appellant had earned under PERSON no . CARDINAL were protected under what was then LAW ( currently LAW see section CARDINAL of LAW , Law no .

The ORG does not consider that section CARDINAL of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL provided authorisation for the [ ORG to curtail the benefit provisions ; this could only be done under an unequivocal provision of law . Nor can the ORG accept that the wording of subsection ( CARDINAL ) of LAW no . CARDINAL meant that the ORG member did not have an unequivocal right to have his disability assessed in terms of his capacity to do his previous job .", "The evidence in the case shows that ORG was operated at a considerable deficit , and that at DATE more than ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL would have been needed for the principal of the ORG , together with the premiums that it could expect , to cover its commitments , this estimate being based on an DATE interest rate of PERCENT . In order to tackle this large deficit , ORG asked for amendments to be made to the LAW under which the ORG operated . It is clear that the reduction of the pension rights that resulted from LAW no . DATE was based on relevant considerations . Even though that LAW was repealed by LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , this does not change the fact that the appellant \u2019s legal position had already been determined by PERSON no . DATE . The ORG concurs with ORG view that PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL did not constitute a valid legal authorisation for making amendments to the rights that the ORG member had earned during the period of validity of the former legislation .", "The reduction according to Act no .
