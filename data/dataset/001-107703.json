The applicants were both born in DATE and live in Bad PERSON and GPE respectively .", "CARDINAL . From DATE a GCARDINAL summit of Heads of State and Government was held in GPE , in the vicinity of GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police considered that there was a threat of terrorist attacks , in particular by NORP terrorists , during the summit . Furthermore , having regard to the experience of previous GCARDINAL summits , they considered that there was a risk of property damage by left - wing extremists . The latter were found to have planned to protest against , block and sabotage the summit .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police estimated that there would be CARDINAL participants at an international demonstration in GPE on DATE , CARDINAL of whom were ready to use violence , and that there would be CARDINAL demonstrators present during the summit , CARDINAL of whom would be ready to use violence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE serious riots broke out in GPE centre , involving well - organised violent demonstrators , forming what has been termed a \u201c black block \u201d , who attacked the police with stones and baseball bats . CARDINAL policemen were injured .", "CARDINAL . According to a press release of the GPE - West Pomerania Ministry of the ORG dated DATE , CARDINAL police officers had been involved in ensuring that the GCARDINAL summit could be held without disruption and in protecting its participants from attacks by terrorists or antiglobalisation demonstrators prepared to use violence . During the summit , CARDINAL people had been detained in holding pens for prisoners ( Gefangenensammelstellen ) . The courts had been asked to confirm the detainees\u2019 detention in CARDINAL cases ; they had done so in respect of CARDINAL individuals .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants drove to GPE in order to participate in demonstrations against the GCARDINAL summit in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the applicants\u2019 identity was checked and established by the police in a car park in front of PERSON prison , where they were standing next to a van in the company of CARDINAL other people . No other people were present in the car park . The police submitted that the first applicant had physically resisted the identity check . He had allegedly hit the arms of a policeman who had attempted to determine the second applicant \u2019s identity . He had also kicked another policeman \u2019s shin in order to prevent his own identity from being determined . The applicants submitted that the second applicant had himself been hit by the police , although he had already been holding his identity card in his hand ready for inspection . The police searched the van and found folded - up banners bearing the inscriptions \u201c Freedom for all prisoners \u201d and \u201c Free all now \u201d . The applicants were arrested . It appears that the banners found were seized .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL separate decisions taken on DATE at TIME and CARDINAL a.m. respectively , ORG , having examined both applicants in person , ordered their detention ( amtlicher ORG ) until DATE , TIME at the latest .", "CARDINAL . Relying on section GPE ) , paragraph CARDINAL ) , and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the GPE - West Pomerania Public Security and LAW ( Gesetz \u00fcber die \u00f6ffentliche PERSON in GPE - Vorpommern \u2013 \u201c the NORP \u201d , see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , ORG found that the applicants\u2019 detention had been lawful in order to prevent the imminent commission or continuation of a criminal offence . As the applicants had been found in front of PERSON prison in a van in which objects calling for the liberation of prisoners had been discovered , it had to be assumed that they had been about to commit or aid and abet a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that the applicants\u2019 continued detention was indispensable and proportionate . At the hearing , both applicants had given the impression that they had intended to proceed with committing an offence . As they had not made any statements or submissions on the merits , they had been unable to justify their conduct .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in CARDINAL separate decisions , dismissed appeals ( sofortige PERSON ) lodged by the first and second applicants .", "CARDINAL . ORG confirmed ORG finding that the applicants\u2019 arrest had been lawful under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , paragraph CARDINAL ( a ) , of the ORG . As the applicants had been found in the vicinity of PERSON prison in possession of banners with an imperative wording ( \u201c free \u201d ) , they had intended to incite others to free prisoners and that constituted an offence . Moreover , having regard to the material in the case file , the first applicant had obstructed police officers in the exercise of their duties . The second applicant , for his part , had been charged with dangerous interference with rail traffic in DATE in connection with the transport of \u201c castor \u201d containers . ORG further agreed with ORG reasoning to the effect that the continuation of the applicants\u2019 detention was indispensable and proportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed further appeals ( sofortige PERSON ) subsequently brought by the applicants . In their appeals , the applicants , represented by counsel , had submitted that the slogans on the banners had been addressed to the police and the authorities , urging them to end the numerous arrests and detentions of demonstrators . They had not been meant to call upon others to attack prisons and to free prisoners by force , an interpretation which had to be considered far - fetched , given that there had not been any violent liberation of detainees from NORP prisons in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld the lower courts\u2019 finding that the requirements of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , paragraph CARDINAL ) , of the ORG had been met . The applicants\u2019 arrest and continued detention was indispensable in order to avert a danger to public security and order . The banner \u201c Free all now \u201d , together with the banner \u201c Freedom for all prisoners \u201d , could be understood as an incitement to liberate prisoners , an offence under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The police had been entitled to assume that the applicants had intended to drive to GPE and display the banners at the partly violent demonstrations there . As a result , a crowd which had been ready to use violence might have been incited to liberate people who had been arrested and detained .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the second applicant , the requirements of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , paragraph ORG ) , of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had also been met . The second applicant had been arrested in DATE in comparable circumstances on suspicion of dangerous interference with rail traffic in connection with the transport of castor containers . It was irrelevant whether he had subsequently been convicted .", "CARDINAL . The applicants had not contested the ORG conclusions ; they had not made any statements or submissions on the merits . The police had been obliged to take into consideration the general security situation in GPE on DATE . On DATE , very violent clashes between demonstrators and the police had taken place in the city centre . Moreover , the applicants had proved to be prone to violence themselves by attacking police officers .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further considered that the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression under LAW did not warrant a different conclusion . It accepted that the slogans on the banners could be understood in different ways . However , in the tense situation in and around GPE the police had been authorised to prevent ambiguous declarations which could have lead to a risk to public security and order .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the duration of the applicants\u2019 detention was proportionate . According to a report by the NORP police of DATE , CARDINAL anti - globalisation activists , some of whom were very violent , were moving towards PERSON and were calling for an \u201c attack on the embankment \u201d . It could not be ruled out that the applicants would have participated in those demonstrations with the banners and would thus have incited other demonstrators to liberate prisoners .", "CARDINAL . On DATE both applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG and applied for an interim injunction ordering their immediate release .", "CARDINAL . The applicants complained that their detention had violated , in particular , their right to liberty and their right to freedom of expression . The second applicant further submitted that his detention had been in breach of his right to freedom of assembly . Both applicants argued that it had been far - fetched to interpret the slogans on the banners as inciting other demonstrators to attack prisons and to liberate prisoners . The banners had been addressed to the police , who had already arrested many antiglobalisation activists , to the participants in the GCARDINAL summit and to the public in general , and had not advocated acts of violence . The applicants further stressed that they did not have any previous convictions . The second applicant submitted , in particular , that the criminal proceedings against him for dangerous interference with rail traffic had been discontinued .", "CARDINAL . These complaints were initially registered under file nos . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL . On DATE the reporting judge at ORG informed the ORG representatives by telephone that ORG would not take a decision on the ORG request for interim measures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the applicants were released from prison .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 constitutional complaints of DATE were then considered to have become devoid of purpose following their release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants asked ORG to find that their detention had been unconstitutional , despite the fact that they had been released in the meantime . Thereupon , their constitutional complaints were registered anew ( files CARDINAL . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in CARDINAL separate decisions , declined to consider the first and second applicants\u2019 constitutional complaints , without giving reasons ( file FAC . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The decision was served on the first applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE and on the second applicant \u2019s counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The criminal proceedings instituted against the first applicant for having obstructed public officers in the exercise of their duties ( Widerstand gegen LOC ) in the course of the identity check on DATE were discontinued , in exchange for the first applicant paying MONEY ( ORG ) . The criminal proceedings against the second applicant for the same offence were discontinued on grounds of insignificance .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that CARDINAL of the police officers involved in their arrest had later been convicted of causing bodily harm while discharging public duties in relation to a different matter . They submitted that the proceedings were still pending before the appellate court . The Government did not comment on that point .", "CARDINAL . No criminal proceedings were brought against the applicants for having incited others to free prisoners .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 complaints of a violation of their right to be heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the first applicant \u2019s fresh constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and on DATE it declined to consider the second applicant \u2019s fresh constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .
