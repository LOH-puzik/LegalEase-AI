As a secondary - school teacher of classics who has passed the agr\u00e9gation ( the highest competitive examination for teachers ) , PERSON has been a civil servant in the ORG education service since DATE .", "While working at the Paul Eluard Lower Secondary School at ORG ( d\u00e9partement of LOC ) , he was sent on compulsory leave for DATE from DATE by a decision of the schools inspector for PERSON on DATE . The decision was based on LAW of CARDINAL DATE , which provides : \u201c Where the schools inspector \u2026 considers , in the light of a medical certificate or a report by a civil servant \u2019s superiors , that on account of the civil servant \u2019s physical or mental state , the children are exposed to immediate danger , he may send the civil servant concerned on compulsory leave for DATE on full salary . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same inspector decided to suspend payment of the applicant \u2019s salary from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON applied to ORG to quash the decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE and sought a stay of execution of the latter decision .", "CARDINAL . By CARDINAL decisions of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was sent on extended sick - leave from DATE to CARDINAL DATE and then from CARDINAL DATE to PERCENT DATE and on extended leave of absence from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE . On DATE Mr GPE applied to the same court to quash those CARDINAL decisions .", "CARDINAL . The hearing took place on DATE . In a judgment of the same date ORG joined the CARDINAL applications , quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and the one of DATE suspending payment of the applicant \u2019s salary , decided that there was no longer any need to rule on the application for a stay and dismissed the application to have the decisions of CARDINAL DATE quashed . The judgment read as follows :", "\u201c \u2026", "As to the compulsory leave", "\u2026", "Mr PERSON maintained that the headmaster \u2019s report on which the decision complained of was based had been drawn up on DATE , whereas the decision whereby he was sent on compulsory leave had not been issued until DATE . Serious incidents occurred on account of the teacher \u2019s lack of authority . While the headmaster said that Mr GPE \u2019s behaviour had jeopardised pupils\u2019 safety , he did not , however , establish that he had taken the measures , including disciplinary measures , that were within his powers and which would have prevented the situation from becoming critical . Nor does it appear from the report produced that the facts were such as to justify applying LAW decree [ of DATE ] , which only applies in very specific circumstances that justify describing the danger to which the children are exposed as immediate \u2026", "As to the suspension of payment of salary", "Although LAW decree [ no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ] of CARDINAL DATE authorises the administrative authorities to stop paying the salary of a civil servant on extended sick - leave or extended leave of absence who refuses to undergo the treatment and examinations his state dictates , it could not be applied to Mr GPE , who at the time when the impugned decision suspending payment of his salary was taken was not on extended sick - leave or extended leave of absence \u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to the ORG d\u2019Etat on DATE .

On DATE the applicant lodged CARDINAL applications with ORG . In CARDINAL of these he sought to have quashed the implicit refusal of his request for a review of his administrative position and for an advance on his salary , submitting that it was not normal for him to be on unpaid leave and that the medical board had not ruled on his case , thereby preventing him from taking up his duties at LOC at Athis - Mons . In the other application he sought a stay of execution of that implicit refusal , relying on his financial difficulties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG , taking the view that , according to LAW of ORG , ORG had no jurisdiction to hear the foregoing applications , ordered under LAW CARDINAL of the same code that the files should be sent to the President of ORG of the ORG d\u2019Etat .", "CARDINAL .
