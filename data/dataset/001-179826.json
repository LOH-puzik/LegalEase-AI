He contested the prosecutor \u2019s opinion that the injuries incurred had been superficial . He referred to the ORG \u2019s relevant case - law , which required a plausible explanation for any traces of violence sustained while a person had been under police supervision .

It further held that the applicant \u2019s minor lesions had been caused when he had fallen at the moment of his being immobilised by the police , which had been necessary because of the applicant \u2019s verbal and physical resistance . The court considered that the applicant had not been kept unlawfully in the police station but had been released as soon as his identity had been established , and that the consequences of the police intervention had not been serious enough to constitute the crime of torture , as alleged by the applicant .
