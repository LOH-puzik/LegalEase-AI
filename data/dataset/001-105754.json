She argued that PERSON had not proved that she had DATE of professional experience and thus did not demonstrate that she satisfied all the statutory criteria for election as a ORG judge set forth in section CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Therefore , in the applicant \u2019s view , by electing PERSON instead of her , ORG had breached her right to equality before the law , the right to equality before the ORG and other public authorities , the right to equal access to public service and the right to equal access to employment guaranteed in GPE ) , CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG invited PERSON and PERSON to submit their observations as third ( interested ) parties ( zainteresirane osobe ) . On DATE , respectively , they replied that they considered the applicant \u2019s request unfounded and that the election of ORG judges had been in accordance with the law . They also stated that they did not consider themselves third ( interested ) parties to the proceedings because the applicant had not challenged their election .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a judgment whereby it allowed the applicant \u2019s request and quashed ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE in its part concerning PERSON court held that the applicant was entitled to lodge her request even though that court \u2019s judgment did not alter her legal status as unelected candidate . It also held that from the evidence submitted by PERSON to ORG it could not be discerned whether she had the required professional experience and that therefore the applicant \u2019s right to equal access to public service and her right to equal access to employment , guaranteed by ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , had been breached by the contested decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) against ORG judgment . At the same time she asked ORG to order an interim measure that would postpone the effects of the contested judgment until that court had decided on her constitutional complaint . PERSON argued in her constitutional complaint that the impugned judgment of ORG had breached her right to equality before the law , the right to work and the right to equal access to employment guaranteed in GPE CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , respectively . She also argued that the election of the Constitutional Court judges was a political rather than a legal issue . Therefore , ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE constituted a so - called act of ORG ( akt vladanja ) in respect of which the scope of constitutional review was limited to compliance with procedural rules ( that is , to formal constitutionality ) and was thus very narrow . In particular , she argued that ORG had not been authorised to assess whether the evidence she had submitted had been sufficient to prove that she had the required professional experience and to question ORG findings in this respect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , sitting in a plenary session composed of CARDINAL judges ( including judges PERSON and GPE ) , ordered an interim measure postponing the effects of ORG judgment of DATE . In so doing it held , inter alia , that :", "\u201c ... the contested judgment [ of ORG ] requires detailed examination of the limits and scope of judicial review of decisions on appointment of ORG officials , ... , and in that sense , has a wider importance that goes beyond the limits of an individual case . \u201d", "The decision on the interim measure was published in ORG no .

On DATE and DATE , respectively , ORG served the CARDINAL supplements on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted her reply to PERSON \u2019s constitutional complaint and DATE to its supplements of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . She argued that because the election of the ORG judges was regulated by law , it was not a political but primarily a legal issue . Consequently , ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE was not an \u201c act of ORG \u201d and was therefore justiciable , that is , capable of being challenged in legal proceedings . In any event , section CARDINAL of LAW entitled ORG to review any individual decision capable of violating constitutional rights , regardless of its nature or of whether it emanated from the legislative or the executive branch of government . As regards PERSON \u2019s request for an interim measure , the applicant , after having remarked that ORG had granted it on DATE the request had been made , argued that under section ORG ) LAW such a measure could not postpone \u201c the effects of a contested decision \u201d but only its \u201c enforcement \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Lastly , the applicant asked ORG to \u201c hold a public session ( hearing ) \u201d and invite her to attend it ( \u201c odr\u017ei javnu sjednicu ( raspravu ) na PERSON me se pozove \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL .

The remaining CARDINAL law faculty professors from whom ORG also requested expert opinions did not submit them . The attempt to obtain information from ORG failed because the NGO in question could not be found at the address indicated in the relevant register .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to ORG asking it to serve her with \u201c the expert opinions requested ( from individuals and institutions ) \u201d , which she had found out about from the media .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in a plenary formation of CARDINAL judges ( including judges PERSON and GPE ) , held a session to which the applicant was not invited , and adopted a decision whereby it quashed ORG judgment of DATE . It held that the election of ORG judges was a hybrid ( political and legal ) issue and that , even though ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE was \u201c an act of ORG \u201d , ORG could have reviewed not only whether the prescribed procedure had been followed but also whether the candidates had satisfied the required statutory conditions . Nevertheless , ORG had overstepped the bounds of its jurisdiction when it had ( re)assessed the evidentiary value of the documents LAW had furnished as proof that she had possessed the required professional experience . By so doing ORG had not only encroached on matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of ORG , but had also breached ORG right to work and her right to equal access to employment guaranteed by LAW and ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW , as well as her right to equality before the law guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the President of ORG and her Deputy held a press conference at which they announced that ORG judgment of DATE had been quashed , that PERSON remained a judge of ORG and that the case would not be remitted to ORG in order to \u201c stop this agony \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
