They are NORP nationals and were born in DATE and DATE , respectively . The President granted the applicants\u2019 request for their identity not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG ) . They were represented before the ORG by Ms J. Bravo Moug\u00e1n , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr R.A.A. B\u00f6cker , and Deputy Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants and their daughter , born in DATE , fled GPE . On DATE they entered the GPE and applied for asylum , claiming to fear persecution within the meaning of the DATE LAW ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) . DATE a second child was born to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the immigration authorities held a first interview ( eerste gehoor ) with each applicant about their identity , nationality and travel itinerary . A written record of each interview was drawn up . The applicants , who were assisted by a lawyer , were given the opportunity to submit corrections and additions , which they did on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the immigration authorities held a further interview ( nader gehoor ) with each applicant about their reasons for seeking asylum . A written record of each interview was drawn up and on CARDINAL DATE a lawyer submitted corrections and additions on the ORG behalf .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his asylum statement , the first applicant declared that he was a former NORP monk ( \u201c lhama \u201d ) . His only relative was a foster parent who had died in DATE . After his marriage to the second applicant he had resigned as a monk and started to work as a spiritual counsellor . Among his clients were PERSON , a prominent political and government leader , Mr Y , a former business associate of PERSON , and Mr Z , a judge . By DATE , the first applicant had received a CARDINAL page letter from Y who had been placed in pre - trial detention . In this letter Y wrote that he was innocent and wrongly imprisoned and that he had been falsely accused by X. The letter further contained incriminating information about X who was allegedly involved in corruption . The first applicant had not discussed this information with anyone . Soon after , the first applicant had received several threatening telephone calls from accomplices of X. They told him that they knew that he had received the letter , that he knew too much and that he should keep his mouth shut . They also ordered him to give them his GPE records . The second applicant also received threatening calls . On DATE the first applicant learned that Y had died in prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , whilst walking upstairs to his apartment , had been assaulted by CARDINAL unknown men in the stairwell of the building . The CARDINAL men had demanded the letter and the records the first applicant had kept on his clients . When a neighbour had appeared , the CARDINAL men had run off . As requested by Y , the first applicant had taken the letter to Z who had advised him not to go to the police as X had more power than the police . Being a judge , PERSON would deal with the matter himself . According to the first applicant , Y had written the letter to the first applicant and not directly to Z because he had known the first applicant very well and had trusted him .", "CARDINAL . As the applicants had no longer felt safe at home , the first applicant had asked CARDINAL of his other clients to shelter him and his family . This client had done so as from DATE and sheltered the applicants in a town near to GPE . Although the first applicant had changed his telephone number , he continued to receive threatening phone calls .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , whilst travelling for business by car to ORG , the first applicant had a car accident . CARDINAL of the front wheels of his car had broken off , causing the car to roll over twice . His co - driver had been thrown out of the car and the applicant , who had been driving the car , had lost consciousness . The traffic police drew up a report and left . A friend took them and the car back to LOC . When the first applicant reported the accident to the police as requested by the latter , he was told that the accident had been caused by him driving too fast . According to the first applicant this was untrue as he had driven at a normal speed . The first applicant had taken the police report to Z who DATE like the first applicant DATE had found it rather odd and would look into it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Z \u2019s wife had called the first applicant and told him that Z had suddenly died of food poisoning . The first applicant had not believed this and suspected murder . Now fearing for his family and himself , he had started to make preparations to leave GPE which he and his family had done on DATE . With the aid of a \u201c travel agent \u201d to whom they had given their identity documents the applicant , his wife and their daughter had travelled first by train to GPE and later by car to the GPE . This travel agent had not returned their identity documents .", "CARDINAL . The asylum statement of the second applicant , who had also applied for asylum on behalf of the couple \u2019s CARDINAL young children , was based on the asylum statement given by the first applicant . She also stated that her mother and brother were living in GPE . Her father had died in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) issued a notice of her intention ( voornemen ) to reject the first applicant \u2019s asylum application . On DATE the Deputy Minister issued the same notice to the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Deputy Minister considered at the outset that the applicants\u2019 failure to substantiate in a sufficient manner their stated identity , nationality and travel itinerary as well as their failure to give a detailed , coherent and verifiable account of their journey to the GPE cast doubt on the sincerity of their asylum claim and detracted from the credibility of their asylum statement . As to the question whether the ORG asylum statement should nevertheless be accepted as positively persuasive ( positieve overtuigingskracht ) , the Deputy Minister found that the events as described by the first applicant were credible , i.e. the receipt of the letter , the threatening telephone calls and having been assaulted once in the stairwell of the building where he used to live . Noting , inter alia , that the name of X had never been mentioned in the phone calls or by the men who had assaulted the first applicant , the Deputy Minister found that it could not be established that these acts were carried out by accomplices of X and in his name . The Deputy Minister further found that the applicants could and should have reported the threatening telephone calls and the assault in the stairwell to the NORP authorities and that it had not been demonstrated that these authorities would be incapable of providing protection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , assisted by a lawyer , the applicants submitted written comments ( zienswijze ) on the notice of intent sent to both applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in CARDINAL separate decisions and referring to the above notices , the Deputy Minister rejected the applicants\u2019 asylum applications , finding that they had failed to dispel the doubts about the credibility of their asylum statement . The Deputy Minister maintained that the applicants had failed to substantiate their claim that PERSON was corrupt . The fact that government corruption occurred in GPE did not mean that X was personally corrupt as well . The Deputy Minister also maintained that the applicants had failed to establish that X was responsible for the events described by them . These acts could equally have been carried out by accomplices of other powerful men . The Deputy Minister also did not find it demonstrated that the applicants would run a risk of treatment contrary to LAW if they were expelled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE sitting in PERSON accepted the applicants\u2019 appeal , quashed the impugned decisions of QUANTITY DATE , and ordered a fresh determination of the applicants\u2019 asylum claim . It accepted the Deputy Minister \u2019s findings in respect of the absence of any identity documents and the failure to give a detailed , coherent and verifiable account of their journey to the GPE , as well as the Deputy Minister \u2019s conclusion that it was not credible that the death of Y and Z and the first applicant \u2019s car accident resulted from intentional acts instructed by PERSON or committed in his name . However , the Deputy Minister had given insufficient reasons for finding that the applicants\u2019 suspicion that there was a connection between X and the threatening telephone calls received by the applicants and the first applicant \u2019s assault in the stairwell lacked positive persuasiveness as both the threats and the assault were connected to the letter which the applicant had received from DATE was not altered by the fact that it did not appear from general sources that X was involved in corruption or other illegal practices , when taking into account X \u2019s interest in keeping the content of the letter written by Y quiet given that \u2013 according to the official report ( ambtsbericht ) on GPE of DATE as compiled by the Minister of ORG ( Minister PERSON ) DATE the great discontent in the NORP population over the widespread poverty in the country and the corruption in government circles had probably worked to the advantage of X who had campaigned with promises of change and of combatting corruption and income inequality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister for Immigration and Asylum ( Minister PERSON ) , the successor to the Deputy Minister of ORG , filed a further appeal with ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) , arguing essentially that it was for the Minister to assess the credibility of the facts submitted by an asylum - seeker and that the courts could only examine that assessment with due reticence ( terughoudend ) . Referring to the ORG \u2019s case law , the Minister submitted that ORG had overstepped its competence . Pursuant to the system of asylum proceedings , in appeal proceedings ORG should only have determined whether the administrative authority concerned ( i.e. the Minister ) had exercised its administrative powers in a reasonable manner and whether this authority could reasonably have taken the impugned decision ( marginale toetsing ) . In this case however , ORG had made its own findings of fact , substituting them for the findings made by the Minister .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the Minister \u2019s further appeal , quashed the impugned judgment of CARDINAL DATE and rejected the ORG appeal . It held that , instead of examining whether the Minister could not reasonably have reached the conclusions as to the credibility of the applicants\u2019 asylum statement , ORG had wrongly drawn its own separate conclusions in relation to various parts of the asylum statement . It therefore quashed the judgment of ORG and substituted it with its own decision on the appeal , holding that the Minister could reasonably have concluded that the applicants\u2019 stories lacked positive persuasiveness . Accordingly , the applicants had not established that their removal to GPE would expose them to a real and personal risk of being subjected to treatment in violation of LAW . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government informed the ORG that the Departure and Repatriation Service ( PERSON ) of ORG and ORG ( PERSON Justitie ) were taking action for the applicants\u2019 removal to GPE by presenting them to the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the Section decided , under Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) of ORG , that the Government should be invited to submit further observations dealing specifically with aspects of the applicants\u2019 effective removal to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In their reply of CARDINAL DATE , the Government informed the ORG that the removal of rejected asylum - seekers to GPE is only possible when they hold a valid travel document . The Government further stated that they had applied for a laissez - passer on behalf of the applicants at ORG where the applicants had been presented in person in DATE . The applications had been taken into consideration by the authorities of GPE . The GPE authorities are still awaiting the response and have been sending reminders to ORG once or DATE , the most recent one having been sent on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In their reply of CARDINAL DATE , the applicants confirmed that they had been presented to the NORP authorities . They further stated that their nationality had been officially confirmed and that the request for a travel document ( laissez - passer ) was still pending . They could and would be removed to GPE as soon as these documents were issued .", "CARDINAL .
