It is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant company broadcast a report about a press conference of the Federal Minister of Justice ( Justizminister ) in which he presented a reform of the preliminary investigation procedure underlining its necessity by the following statement :", "\u201c See for example the letter - bomb campaign proceedings DATE . Repeatedly investigation errors occur . Judiciary and police authorities mutually accuse each other . Finally , it turns out that the letter - bomb campaign case has been a neo - nazi case . \u201d", "In this context the Minister mentioned as an example of investigation errors , inter alia , the name of B. , who had been acquitted of the charge of participating in the letter - bomb assassinations but convicted of offences under LAW ( GPE ) . The criminal proceedings against PERSON and the following criminal proceedings concerning the letter - bomb campaign against another accused , who had been arrested in DATE and convicted in DATE , received extensive media coverage .", "When transmitting the above quotation of the Minister , the applicant company showed a picture of PERSON before his trial in DATE , without mentioning his name , his acquittal of the charge concerning the letter - bomb assassinations , the service of his sentence of offences under LAW or his release on parole DATE before the report at issue was broadcast .", "On DATE B. brought proceedings under LAW ) against the applicant company , requesting that the applicant be prohibited from publishing his picture without his consent , in particular such pictures that showed him as an accused in the courtroom , firstly , if the accompanying text established a connection with the letter - bomb campaign without reference to his final acquittal or , secondly , if it was maintained in the accompanying text , or the impression was created that he was a neo - nazi , was convicted of offences under LAW without mentioning that the imposed sentence had already been served , or that he had been released on parole meanwhile .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed PERSON 's claims .", "The court observed that LAW prohibited the publication of a person 's picture if it violated that person 's legitimate interests . As regards the first claim , the court found that PERSON 's legitimate interests had not been violated as it was a matter of common knowledge that he had been acquitted of the charge of participating in the letter - bomb campaign . Since he was therefore no longer associated with these proceedings by the public , the report could not have given the impression that he had been convicted of this charge . In respect of the second claim , the court found that the report could not have violated PERSON 's interests as he was finally convicted of offences under LAW . Further the court observed that the applicant company 's interest in publishing the picture had to be balanced against B. 's interest in the protection of his image , under LAW of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) . Pursuant to this provision the legitimate interests of the person concerned had to be regarded as harmed if the publication substantially prejudiced that person 's social and professional advancement .

In particular , the court found that the publication of PERSON 's picture met a need for information and it had not prejudiced his advancement as he had already found employment and as the picture of the trial had only been shown in order to demonstrate that PERSON had been a victim of investigation errors . Moreover , he had not been mentioned by name .", "On DATE ORG , allowing PERSON 's further appeal , set aside the decisions of the first and second instance court and granted his claims .", "It found that the publication of B. 's picture , taken before the trial concerning the charges against him at that time , had obviously interfered with his interests as it had reminded the public of B. 's court appearance DATE after his trial and after his release on parole . Further , the court found that there had been no need for such information and that the publication of the picture did not add any information to the applicant company 's report about the Minister 's press conference . The court concluded that it was not called upon to balance the conflicting interests concerning PERSON 's social and professional advancement , within the meaning of Section CARDINALa of LAW , as there was no public interest in having PERSON 's picture published . The court found that the publication had precisely the effects prohibited by LAW .", "Thus , the court ordered the applicant company to refrain from publishing or disseminating B. 's picture without his consent , in particular such pictures that showed him as an accused in the courtroom , firstly , if the accompanying text established a connection with the letter - bomb campaign of DATE without reference to his final acquittal or , secondly , if it was maintained in the accompanying text , or the impression was created that he was a neo - nazi or that he was convicted of offences under LAW without mentioning that the imposed sentence had already been served , or that he had been released on parole meanwhile .", "a.
