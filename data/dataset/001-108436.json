The applicant was born in DATE . He is married ; he and his wife ( born in DATE ) have CARDINAL children , born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . The family are resident in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arrived in the GPE , DATE after his wife and CARDINAL children had arrived there . On DATE the applicant applied for asylum . The Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) rejected this application on DATE but he did grant the applicant a conditional residence permit ( voorwaardelijke vergunning tot verblijf ) , valid as of DATE , on the basis of a temporary \u201c policy of protection for certain categories \u201d ( categoriaal beschermingsbeleid ) . The applicant \u2019s wife and children received residence permits for the purpose of asylum that same day . The applicant lodged an objection against the decision to refuse him asylum .", "CARDINAL . The situation in GPE not having sufficiently improved , the applicant \u2019s conditional residence permit was ex lege converted into an indefinite residence permit after he had held it for a period of DATE . Subsequently , with the entry into force of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet CARDINAL ) on DATE , the permit held by the applicant came to be named an indefinite residence permit for the purpose of asylum . In view of this development , the applicant \u2019s objection against the decision of CARDINAL DATE was declared inadmissible on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON Integratie , at that time the successor to the Deputy Minister of ORG ) withdrew the applicant \u2019s residence permit ( but not those of his wife and children ) as LAW relating to the Status of Refugees was held against him . The applicant filed an appeal against this decision which was rejected by ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State ) confirmed the decision of ORG at final instance .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed by ORG of GPE on DATE , and on DATE ORG of ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal at final instance .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the applicant applied for a residence permit for the purpose of residing in the GPE with his wife . At the same time , he requested an exemption from the obligation to pay the statutory administrative charges ( leges ) of MONEY ( ORG ) . In this respect he invoked LAW amending LAW CARDINAL ( Wijzigingsbesluit Vreemdelingencirculaire DATE ) , according to which an alien who has a justifiable claim under LAW in proceedings to obtain a residence permit for the purposes of family reunion ( gezinshereniging ) or family formation ( gezinsvorming ) could be exempted from paying the required charges if he or she complied with certain conditions . The applicant argued that he had a legitimate claim under LAW and that he had provided sufficient proof that he did not have the resources to pay the charges : since the withdrawal of his residence permit he himself was no longer eligible for social assistance and his family had to survive on social assistance intended for a single - parent family . There were no relatives or third persons prepared or able to pay the charges for him . He submitted a copy of his wife \u2019s social assistance pay slip for DATE ( stating a total payable amount of EUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , an official extract from the register of marriages dated DATE showing him to be married to his wife , and an official document showing him , his wife and their children to be registered at the same address .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the Minister decided not to process the application for a residence permit , as the applicant had failed to pay the required charge .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an objection with the Minister against that decision , arguing that he had submitted a reasoned request to be exempted from the obligation to pay the administrative charge , which request the Minister had rejected without stating any grounds . On DATE the applicant also applied for a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) to ORG of GPE in order to be allowed to await the outcome of his appeal in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request for a provisional measure and at the same time dismissed the objection . It considered that the applicant had failed to submit sufficient proof of his lack of resources to pay the required fees ; it had therefore not been unreasonable for the Minister to decide not to process the applicant \u2019s request for a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . No appeal lay against the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in reply to questions put to them pursuant to Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of ORG , the Government confirmed that , at the time the applicant lodged his request for a residence permit for the purpose of residing with his wife , the latter was in receipt of social assistance benefits for a single - parent family . They further confirmed that the applicant was not in possession of a residence permit entitling him to acquire income by working in the GPE . He had nevertheless not qualified for the exemption from the obligation to pay administrative charges as he had submitted neither the required declaration of income and assets nor evidence relating to efforts made by his wife ( being the residence permit holder with whom the applicant intended to stay ) to obtain the necessary funds .", "CARDINAL . In reply to a further question , the Government submitted on DATE that the assessment framework for an objection against the decision not to process an application for a residence permit due to a failure to pay the administrative charges was based on an ex tunc evaluation of whether that decision had been taken on reasonable grounds . Paying the administrative charges or submitting the required evidence subsequently was not an option ; nor would it have any bearing on the decision not to process the application , as an ex nunc assessment was no longer possible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to a further question , the Government confirmed that the applicant could submit a new application for a residence permit , which would be processed once he had paid the administrative charges or obtained an exemption from the obligation to pay them . The examination of the merits of such an application would include an assessment of compliance with LAW .", "CARDINAL .

Day - to - DATE implementation of the Work and Social Assistance Act , including the providing of social assistance and any verification , is the responsibility of the Mayor and Aldermen ( burgemeester en wethouders ) of the municipality ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL .
