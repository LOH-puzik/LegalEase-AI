He was represented before the ORG by Mr L. Paproth , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "Since DATE the applicant , a doctor , had been employed as an expert by the medical service of the NORP health insurance which provides medical expert reports to health insurance companies ( GPE ORG in ORG ) .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s employer ordered him to conduct a medical examination of an apprentice with a view to her being employed by a client health insurance company . On CARDINAL and DATE the applicant contested this instruction as he feared a \u201c possible bias \u201d which could lead to difficulties if he had to work with the apprentice in the future . He did not specify exactly what those difficulties might be .", "Following this refusal and CARDINAL warnings ( Abmahnungen ) concerning the applicant \u2019s failure to follow other instructions from his employer , he was dismissed on DATE .", "Subsequently , he lodged an action with ORG to have his dismissal annulled . He argued that a \u201c moral dilemma \u201d had prevented him from carrying out the requested examination .", "On DATE ORG found for the applicant . It argued that , although he had not provided an objective or clear reasoning , the applicant had proved that he had experienced a subjective moral dilemma which could justify his refusal to carry out the examination .", "On DATE ORG quashed that decision and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action , arguing that the applicant could not rely on his freedom of conscience for the following reasons : Firstly , when he had refused to carry out the examination on DATE , the applicant had not mentioned a moral dilemma , but referred only to a fear of \u201c bias \u201d . Moreover , the applicant could not rely on a moral dilemma , as he had at CARDINAL point \u2013 even if only for DATE been prepared to carry out the requested examination , which proved that he had not felt bound by an unconditional , compelling decision of conscience ( unbedingt verpflichtende GPE ) . Secondly , even assuming that his decision had been based on conscience , it had been impossible for the applicant \u2019s employer , on the basis of the applicant \u2019s reasoning , to appreciate that he had been experiencing a moral dilemma . In particular , the applicant had overlooked the fact that no conflict of interest would have arisen regardless of whether the applicant had recommended the apprentice for employment or not : he would only have had to work with the apprentice if he had recommended her . If he had decided in her favour , no question of conflict would have arisen . If the applicant had not recommended her , any future conflict would have been excluded because he would not have had to work with her .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal on points of law as ORG decision had not diverged from the case - law of ORG .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , and confirmed that ORG reasoning had not violated his freedom of conscience ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
