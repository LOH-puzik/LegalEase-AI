The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE protests broke in a number of prisons throughout the country regarding demands for ORG to enact specific amnesty - related legislation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , according to various official reports , violent conflicts between the CARDINAL main groups of prisoners occurred in ORG . It would appear that a radical group of prisoners clashed with the moderate leaders over how to proceed with the protests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prevailing group of prisoners requested that all prison staff , including the guards , vacate the dormitories . They also reportedly threatened the prison staff with kidnappings should they fail to comply with this request . The prison staff therefore left the CARDINAL buildings in question and the prisoners subsequently , at TIME , barricaded the entrances with furniture . CARDINAL prisoners were thus left without any official supervision . The security situation in the Ni\u0161 Penitentiary continued to deteriorate thereafter . The prison authorities assessed that there was a very real threat to the life and health of the prisoners who had refused to take part in the revolt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the governor of ORG formed a crises team which decided that a large scale intervention was necessary . ORG produced a detailed action plan in this regard . It included , inter alia , the assessment of the resistance that could be expected on the part of the prisoners , the force needed to overcome this resistance and the need to secure the presence of medical teams during and in the aftermath of the intervention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , CARDINAL special police officers , members of the ORG , wearing helmets with visors , assisted by prison guards and other security staff , entered ORG . The protests were brought under control by TIME", "CARDINAL . According to the information subsequently provided by ORG , a total of CARDINAL prisoners had been injured and medically treated . The same document stated that the injuries sustained , except in CARDINAL case , were slight in character and had been inflicted by means of blunt force trauma .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police maintained that during their intervention a certain number of prisoners had offered active resistance . Many also had certain pre - existing injuries stemming from a violent conflict which had apparently occurred between the prisoners themselves prior to the intervention . The police lastly noted that some prisoners had been injured as a result of the general commotion that had ensued in the course of the intervention , including prisoners being trampled over by other prisons and/or pushed against the furniture which had been moved into the corridors .", "CARDINAL . The applicants claimed that in the course of the intervention and/or shortly thereafter they had been physically abused by the police officers and/or the prisons guards . Concerning the intervention itself , the applicants contended that they had been beaten with baseball bats and truncheons , forced to run CARDINAL rows of police officers and/or prison guards who had kicked them as they passed and , lastly , compelled to lie on a cold , concrete floor for TIME while being handcuffed . As a result , the applicants allegedly sustained various injuries , such as fractured bones , bruises and wounds all over the body , internal bleeding and brain concussions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the investigating judge of ORG and ORG took part in an on - site investigation which found a large number of improvised weapons ( i.e. knives , blades and metal pipes ) on the premises of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having reviewed the reports of the police officers who had used restraints in the course of the intervention , the commanding officer of the ORG unit involved decided that the force used had been lawful and proportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG forwarded the TIME of the on - site investigation to ORG ( \u201c NMPPO \u201d ) . These TIME were accompanied by several police reports , photographic documentation , and a statement listing the objects which had been found in prison following the police intervention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NMPPO requested information from the police concerning the identity of the injured persons and the reasons for the application of coercive measures .", "CARDINAL . DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicants lodged their criminal complaints against unnamed police officers and a number of prison guards . The latter were , for the most part , identified by their respective first names and/or nicknames . The applicants urged the NMPPO to : ( i ) establish the full identities of all officials who had participated in their abuse ; ( ii ) obtain the relevant medical records documenting their injuries ; ( iii ) hear a number of other prisoners who had witnessed their ill - treatment ; and ( iv ) ultimately , press criminal charges against all those responsible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NMPPO ordered the police to submit the reports prepared in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police provided the NMPPO with a list of prisoners who had been injured on DATE and subsequently treated at ORG . The following applicants were among them : PERSON ORG , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , and Mr ORG . They were all certified as having sustained different kinds of bruises and/or excoriations . On the same occasion the police identified the CARDINAL prison guards to whom the applicants had referred in their criminal complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the NMPPO requested the police to interrogate the prison guards in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police submitted a report , based partly on statements apparently given by a number of prisoners , to the effect that there had been several violent clashes between the various groups of prisoners on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , resulting in serious injuries and a criminal prosecution . The CARDINAL prison guards were also questioned and all denied ill - treating the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NMPPO requested the police to hear the applicants and the eyewitnesses specified in the criminal complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE police interviewed the following CARDINAL applicants on the LOC of ORG : Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr ORG , Mr FAC , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON . All , except for Mr PERSON , confirmed that they had been abused as described at paragraph CARDINAL above . Some also confirmed having witnessed the abuse suffered by other applicants and identified the prison guards in question . Mr PERSON , for his part , refused to give a statement to the police , explaining that he would only testify before a court of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NMPPO decided to reject the applicants\u2019 criminal complaints . In so doing , it took into account , inter alia , the statements given by the prison guards , the available medical documents , the on - sight investigation , and the conclusion of the police ORG commander to the effect that the force used had been lawful and proportionate . Concerning the injuries sustained by the applicants , the NMPPO opined that they had been caused by fights between the prisoners themselves , their falling down the stairs or against the furniture in the course of the operation and/or the ORG resistance to the police who had been trying to restore order to ORG . Lastly , the NMPPO noted that the proportionality of the entire intervention was best evidenced by the fact that despite the large number of prisoners involved , of which some had been armed and dangerous , and the scale of the intervention only a small number of persons had been injured , sustaining , as they did , mostly slight bodily harm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested from the investigating judge of ORG to establish the identity of all police officers and prison guards concerned , with the intention of starting a \u201c subsidiary prosecution \u201d against them ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . The applicants stated that they knew the prison guards by their first names or nicknames only , while the identity of the police officers could be established through their commanding officer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , despite a prior negative opinion expressed by the investigating judge , the pre - trial Chamber of ORG ordered that the applicants be heard ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

All applicants , except for Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and PERSON recounted the alleged abuse suffered at the hands of the police officers and/or prison guards . Some of them identified , by first name or nickname , the prison guards in question but none could provide any details regarding the identity of the police officers since they had visors covering their faces . Mr PERSON , however , stated that despite having been ill - treated by the police he did not want anyone to be convicted for the incident and had therefore decided to withdraw his complaint . Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON stated , respectively , that they were not the persons of the same name and surname who had complained of police brutality . Mr PERSON Simonovi\u0107 described his alleged ill - treatment by the police and prison guards but stated that \u201c out of fear \u201d he did not want to name the persons concerned . Mr PERSON related that he was sorry to have been involved in the incident at all and would like to withdraw his criminal complaint .", "CARDINAL . Though duly informed of the hearing held on DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel did not attend it . On DATE he informed the investigating judge that he had had to attend another hearing , in a different case , scheduled earlier .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge invited the ORG counsel to provide the court with information as to the whereabouts of a number of applicants who had in the meantime been released or transferred to another penitentiary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 counsel responded by stating that he was not obliged to comply with this request . The investigating judge should instead have addressed his request to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG and FAC informed the investigating judge that CARDINAL applicants , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , were not in their custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge heard another CARDINAL applicants , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , in his own office . They recounted the abuse allegedly inflicted by the police and/or the prison guards but could not identify the police officers because of their visors . Mr PERSON further stated that since he had only recently arrived to ORG he could not identify the prison guards in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ni\u0161 Penitentiary informed the investigating judge that out of the CARDINAL applicants who had yet to be heard some had been moved to other penitentiaries , specifying which , and some released , specifying their home addresses . It subsequently transpired that CARDINAL of these applicants , Mr PERSON , had escaped from prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge of ORG , acting on the request of ORG , heard another applicant , Mr PERSON , who described the alleged abuse suffered in the course of the police intervention . He could not , however , identify the officers because of their visors .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the investigating judge of ORG received TIME of the interrogations of another CARDINAL applicants , specifically Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , carried out before the municipal courts in ORG , GPE , ORG and ORG . All applicants reaffirmed that they had been beaten by the police and/or prison guards during the intervention and all , except for Mr PERSON , identified by name the prison guards who had taken part in the alleged abuse . Mr PERSON further gave a physical description of CARDINAL of the police officers who had allegedly ill - treated him since this officer \u2019s face had been visible . Mr PERSON , in addition , provided a detailed written statement containing a thorough account of his alleged abuse during the intervention and subsequently . In support of these assertions he offered the names of the prison guards in question , the name of the police officer who had allegedly beaten him , a list of CARDINAL prison guards who could allegedly confirm that he had been denied medical assistance , and the names of CARDINAL prisoners and prison gourds who had witnessed his alleged abuse and/or seen his injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE applicant Mr Ivica Jonovi\u0107 withdrew his request filed with the investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge informed the applicants\u2019 counsel that he had complied with the instructions of the pre - trial ORG and that it was now up to the applicants to decide whether to take over the prosecution of the case in the capacity of subsidiary prosecutors within DATE ( see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 counsel complained to the investigating judge that he was effectively deprived of the possibility to take over the prosecution of the case on behalf of his clients . Specifically , the investigating judge had , in breach of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , failed to provide him with the case file which could have enabled him to be informed of the available evidence and of the identities of the perpetrators in question ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) . Also , a period of DATE was simply too short .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge addressed the applicants\u2019 counsel . He stated , inter alia , that the latter had shown very little interest in the case to date , having never sought access to the case file or attended the hearings . Moreover , some of the applicants had themselves indicated that they had lost all contact with their lawyer . Finally , the investigating judge recalled that counsel acting on behalf of subsidiary prosecutors were not entitled to be provided with the case file but could review it on the court \u2019s own premises .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NMPPO decided that there were no grounds to bring a criminal case against any of the prisoners involved in the revolt and explained that they had never had the intent to use force in order to escape from prison which was a necessary precondition for the existence of the crime provided for in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a number of applicants , specifically Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON ORG , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr ORG and Mr PERSON , requested from ORG , through their counsel , to provide them with copies of their respective medical files . On DATE , however , ORG declined to do so since this would be in breach of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Based on the copies of the partly inconsistent documents containing medical information , received by the ORG after the communication of the present application , the ORG maintained that between DATE and DATE the following applicants had not received any medical treatment or , if they had , no physical injuries had been recorded in the course of the examination : Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON .
