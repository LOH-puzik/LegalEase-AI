The first applicant ( \u201c the applicant \u201d ) was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant \u2019s companion found out that he was suffering from lymph gland cancer and Aids . He informed the applicant about the cancer but concealed his Aids infection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he informed their family physician about his diseases but forbade him to disclose to anybody that he had developed Aids . When the applicant consulted the physician on DATE he did not mention to her that her companion was suffering from Aids . On DATE the applicant \u2019s companion died . During a further consultation in DATE the physician informed the applicant that her companion had died from Aids .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a blood test established that the applicant was HIV - positive . Since DATE the applicant has been following antiretroviral treatment . She is not suffering from full - blown Aids .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant sued her physician for damages before ORG ( Landgericht ) . She submitted that the physician had failed to inform her that her companion was suffering from Aids and had thus prevented her from protecting herself against infection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court - appointed expert , having examined the case file and a number of laboratory results , submitted his expert opinion . The expert considered that it was probable that the applicant had contracted the virus before DATE . The laboratory results dating from DATE , combined with general statistical data , only allowed a rough estimate of the time of infection . The expert further considered that it was not general medical practice in DATE to treat early HIV infections with antiretroviral drugs . During the oral hearing before ORG the expert expressed the view that an infection before DATE was very likely .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , which was in possession of the physician \u2019s medical records on the first applicant and on her late partner , rejected the action . That court considered that the physician had not been obliged to disclose her companion \u2019s infection to the applicant . Having regard to his duty of confidence towards the applicant \u2019s companion , he would only have been under such an obligation if this could be regarded as the only possibility of preventing the applicant \u2019s infection . This had not been the case , as the physician had consistently advised the applicant \u2019s companion to take the necessary steps to prevent infection and could reasonably believe that the latter would follow his advice . Under these circumstances , ORG did not find it necessary to determine whether there was a causal connection between the applicant \u2019s contracting HIV and the physician \u2019s alleged failure to inform her about her companion \u2019s infection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . Contrary to ORG opinion , ORG considered that the physician had misconceived his duty of care owed towards the applicant in his position as family physician and overestimated his duty of confidence owed towards her companion . As laid down in CARDINAL of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) a physician \u2019s duty of confidence owed towards a patient had to be restricted or even given up if a superior value was at stake . By not informing the applicant about the fatal threat to her health , he had committed an error in treatment . The court considered , however , that the physician had not disregarded medical standards in a blindfold way , but had only overestimated his duty of confidence while balancing the different interests . It followed that his behaviour could not be qualified as a gross error in treatment which , according to the established case - law of ORG , would have entailed a reversal of the burden of proof as to the causality of the error in treatment and the first applicant \u2019s HIV - positive status . Referring to the written opinion submitted by the court - appointed expert in the first - instance proceedings , ORG considered that the applicant had not been able to prove that she had contracted the virus after DATE , when the physician himself had been informed that her companion was HIV - positive . According to the expert \u2019s opinion , it was more likely that she had already become HIV - positive before DATE . ORG further considered that there was no doubt about the expert \u2019s high competence . The expert opinion was well reasoned and took into account relevant scientific publications . Under these circumstances , ORG did not find it necessary to hear further expert opinion as requested by the applicant .", "ORG further considered that medical treatment such as was available in DATE would not have improved the first applicant \u2019s physical condition , even if she had been informed of her HIV status by that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law for lack of prospect of success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , in the course of separate criminal investigations against the physician , another medical expert submitted his opinion on the applicant \u2019s HIV - positive status to ORG . While not concurring with the first expert \u2019s opinion that it was very likely that she had contracted the virus before DATE , the expert considered that a date prior to DATE could not be excluded . In DATE ORG discontinued criminal investigations on the ground that it could not be excluded beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had contracted the virus before DATE . Appeals by the applicant were to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the physician to hand her the complete medical files . On DATE the physician informed her that he had destroyed the medical files after expiry of the time - limit for storage .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides inter alia :", "\u201c A person who , wilfully or negligently , unlawfully injures another person \u2019s life , body , health ( ... ) is bound to compensate him for any damage arising therefrom . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL as in force at the material time provides inter alia :", "\u201c In the case of injury to the body or health ( ... ) the injured party may also demand fair compensation in money for moral prejudice . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A patient requesting damages from a physician under section CARDINAL of LAW generally carries the burden of proof for the requisite causal connection between the physician \u2019s negligence and the damage to his health . According to the established NORP case - law , in case of gross error in treatment the burden of proof is reversed to the physician . A gross error in treatment is generally assumed if the physician clearly breaches well - established medical rules or assured medical knowledge , and has committed an error which does not appear to be comprehensible from an objective point of view , as a physician must absolutely not commit such an error ( see ORG , CARDINAL DATE , no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and DATE , no . PERSON CARDINAL ) . The existence of a gross error has been accepted in cases where a physician had not discovered a serious disease ( meningitis ) in spite of unambiguous symptoms ( see ORG , DATE , no . CARDINAL U CARDINAL/CARDINAL , or ORG , DATE , no . CARDINAL U CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) or had failed to order undoubtedly necessary medical examinations or treatments ( ORG , CARDINAL DATE , no . PERSON DATE ) or to inform the patient about the necessity to undergo further medical examinations ( ORG , DATE , no . PERSON CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code provides :", "\u201c Whoever negligently causes bodily injury to another person shall be punished with imprisonment for not DATE or a fine . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL provides inter alia :", "\u201c Whoever , without authorisation , discloses the secret of another , in particular , a secret which belongs to the realm of personal privacy ( ... ) which was confided to , or otherwise made known to him in his capacity as a physician ( ... ) shall be punished with imprisonment for not DATE or with a fine . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL provides as follows :", "\u201c Whoever , faced with an imminent danger to life , limb , freedom , honour , property , or another legal interest which can not otherwise be averted , commits an act to avert the danger from himself or another , does not act unlawfully , if , upon weighing the conflicting interests , in particular the affected legal interests and the degree of danger threatening them , the protected interest substantially outweighs the one interfered with . This shall apply , however , only to the extent that the act is a proportionate means to avert the danger . \u201d", "If ORG refuses to prefer criminal charges against an alleged offender , the aggrieved party may , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , lodge a request for a court decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2", "6", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1", "6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
