It would appear from the case file that the salient fact in the domestic proceedings was the applicant \u2019s association with the mujahedin in GPE ( \u201c BH \u201d ) . The term mujahedin has been widely used to refer to foreigners \u2013 mainly from the NORP world \u2013 who came to BH during the war in support of NORP . However , the same term has been used to describe local NORP who joined the foreign mujahedin , endorsed their ideology and adjusted to their way of dressing . The phenomenon has been explained by ORG for the former GPE ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) in PERSON and PERSON , IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-T , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE , and Deli\u0107 , IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-T , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE , as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first foreign mujahedin arrived in BH in DATE via GPE and with the assistance of the NORP authorities . It would appear that their arrival was welcomed by the ORG authorities . While the presence of at least some foreign mujahedin seems to have been motivated by a desire to provide humanitarian assistance to the NORP population , most of them actively supported the military struggle against the NORP ORG adversaries , ready to conduct a jihad or \u201c holy war \u201d . As stated by PERSON , an ORG witness of NORP origin who came to ORG in DATE , some of the mujahedin were members of ORG who had the aim of \u201c creating a base that would allow them to increase their area of operations \u201d . Some of them also came to perform missionary work .", "CARDINAL . Upon arrival , foreign mujahedin settled in various locations and did not form a homogeneous entity . Towards DATE , NORP started to join the foreign mujahedin . The locals were provided with military training and participated in combat action . They were also given religious instruction . A number of groups comprising foreign and/or local mujahedin were active . Notwithstanding instances of participation in combat alongside each other , it appears that these groups were anxious to maintain their distinct identities . There were religious and ideological differences between them , which resulted in occasional violent clashes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the foreign mujahedin were organised into a unit within the local ORG ( ORG of GPE ) forces . The unit , named \u201c GPE \u201d , was based in GPE . Following its establishment , the unit significantly grew in size . By DATE , it consisted of CARDINAL fighters . Although the original idea had been to replenish the unit with foreign mujahedin only , locals soon outnumbered its foreign members . The factors that motivated locals to join it included : its stricter regimental discipline ; a better degree of organisation ; superior equipment and combat morale ; its religious dedication ; and material benefits . The unit received funds and assistance from many organisations and individuals from the NORP world , including ORG and ORG . ORG in GPE provided logistical support .", "CARDINAL . El Mujahedin had a number of features setting it apart from regular ORG units . It was led by foreign mujahedin who were not appointed by the ORG . At the top of the hierarchy was an emir , who has been described as the highest - ranking person within the unit . PERSON , a NORP , was its first emir . In DATE , he was succeeded by an NORP , PERSON , who remained in that position until the end of the war . A different person from the emir , the military commander , headed the military council and was responsible for the conduct of combat operations . In DATE , this post was held by an NORP named PERSON . After his death in DATE , another NORP , PERSON , succeeded him . PERSON was killed in DATE . The unit had a religious council , the shura , which was its supreme decision - making body . It consisted of CARDINAL prominent members of the unit , mostly of NORP origin . The emir was elected by and answerable to the shura . At DATE , Sheikh PERSON joined the leadership of the unit . He was the head of ORG in GPE and known to be an extremist who was well - connected with NORP fundamentalists all over the world ( the ORG relied in that regard on a judgment of ORG of DATE ) . He facilitated the recruitment of volunteers from NORP countries for the struggle in BH . Although Sheikh PERSON did not hold an official function within the unit , its members considered him to be the political authority and even the real emir within the unit . He could issue binding rulings ( fatwa ) and his authority was never challenged by the shura . Sheikh PERSON was killed , together with GPE PERSON , at an HVO ( Croatian Defence Council ) military checkpoint on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The General Framework Agreement for Peace , which ended the war in ORG , was initialled at a military base near GPE , GPE , on DATE and signed in GPE , GPE , on DATE . LAW CARDINALA to that Agreement called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces , including individual advisors , freedom fighters , trainers , volunteers , and personnel from neighbouring and other GPE , irrespective of whether they were legally and militarily subordinated to any of the local forces . In view of that , on DATE the ORG disbanded ORG and ordered its foreign members to leave the country by DATE . Despite initial resistance , the shura accepted that the unit be disbanded . It would appear that awards , such as the \u201c GPE \u201d , were given to its members as an incentive for foreigners to leave . Members of the unit were also provided with ORG certificates of service , which assisted its foreign members to acquire ORG citizenship . Whereas most of the unit \u2019s foreign members left ORG , some of them ( such as the present applicant ) applied for ORG citizenship and continue to live in ORG to date .", "CARDINAL . After the attacks of DATE , the official attitude towards foreign mujahedin changed dramatically . Many lost their ORG citizenship or were deported from ORG after being declared a threat to national security .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG established that the applicant was a threat to national security and placed him in ORG . It relied on secret intelligence reports . On DATE ORG , having assessed the secret evidence , upheld that decision . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as manifestly ill - founded .

On DATE ORG refused his request and granted him a period for voluntary departure of DATE . On DATE ORG upheld that decision . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . It would appear that those proceedings are still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant claimed asylum . He maintained that NORP citizens who had joined the foreign mujahedin during the war in GPE and GPE were treated in GPE as suspected terrorists and were subjected to ill - treatment . He added that his friend had informed him that his name was on a \u201c black list \u201d and that his family was subjected to threats and ill - treatment due to their affiliation with ORG . The applicant also claimed that he would be persecuted by NORP and NORP upon his return to GPE ( GPE ) because he is NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG interviewed the applicant in the presence of his lawyer and a ORG representative . It also had regard to reports of ORG , the ORG , ORG and the GPE on GPE .

However , he claimed that during these visits he had been forced to hide in fear of the NORP authorities as his friend had told him that he was under surveillance and that his name was on a \u201c black list \u201d . The applicant further claimed that in his subsequent contact with his family , after he had returned to GPE , they had told him that the NORP had searched their home looking for him . On DATE ORG refused the asylum claim and granted him a period for voluntary departure of DATE . ORG held that the applicant \u2019s statements were contradictory and that he had not provided any evidence in support of his claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that decision and remitted the case for a retrial stating that ORG should make a more thorough assessment of the applicant \u2019s claim . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request for asylum and granted him a period for voluntary departure of DATE . On DATE ORG upheld that decision .
