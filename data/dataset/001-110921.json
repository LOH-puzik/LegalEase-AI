On several occasions , PERSON had approached the father in his home and taken him to their head office for interrogation .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant submitted that she had not been politically involved and that she knew little of the extent of her husband \u2019s involvement in political activities while they were living in GPE .

The ORG story about their activities in GPE was considered stringent and substantiated by written evidence and the court found no reason to question the credibility of the story . However , reports showed that mainly high - ranking executives or militant members of the GPE were subjected to violent acts . It was not considered probable that the NORP authorities would show an interest in someone at such a low level as the first applicant . Furthermore , the political activities in GPE had been limited in scope and the applicants had not been able to show that these activities were of any interest to the authorities . The submitted letter from the first applicant \u2019s father and the certificate from the GPE \u2019s office in GPE were considered very general or of low value as evidence .

In a judgment of ORG in ORG ( GPE ) [ CARDINAL ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL , the issue of sur place activities was considered . The case concerned an appeal by an NORP of NORP ethnicity who claimed to have been involved with GPE , a NORP political party , in GPE and that GPE leaflets had been found in his home . He had said that after fleeing GPE and applying for asylum he had become more involved with GPE . A photograph of him had been posted on the internet and a film sequence of a demonstration he had attended in GPE had been broadcast on ORG in GPE . ORG considered that the Immigration Judge \u2019s conclusions on the credibility of the appellant were not sustainable , however , the court did also consider the appellant \u2019s sur place activities . Bearing in mind that the burden of proof lay on the appellant , Lord ORG found that the Immigration Judge had been entitled to reach the conclusion he did . He commented :", "\u201c There must be a limit as to how far an applicant for asylum is entitled to rely upon publicity about his activities in the GPE against the government of the country to which he is liable to be returned . It seems to me that it is not enough for such an applicant simply to establish , as here , that he was involved in activities which were relatively limited in duration and importance , without producing any evidence that the authorities would be concerned about them , or even that they were or would be aware of them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . However , in GPE ( GPE ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL , which was handed down on DATE , ORG took the following approach to the issue of sur place activities . The case involved an NORP asylum seeker who claimed to have been active in support of the opposition ORG whilst in GPE . ORG again remitted the issues arising from sur place activities to be heard before a differently constituted ORG , which stated :", "\u201c ... [ T]he ORG , while accepting that the appellant \u2019s political activity in this country was genuine , were not prepared to accept in the absence of positive evidence that the NORP authorities had \u2018 the means and the inclination\u2019 to monitor such activities as a demonstration outside their embassy , or that they would be able to identify the appellant from photographs of the demonstration . In my judgment , and without disrespect to what is a specialist tribunal , this is a finding which risks losing contact with reality . Where , as here , the tribunal has objective evidence which \u2018 paints a bleak picture of the suppression of political GPE by a named government , it requires little or no evidence or speculation to arrive at a strong possibility , - and perhaps DATE that its foreign legations not only film or photograph their nationals who demonstrate in public against the regime but have informers among expatriate oppositionist organisations who can name the people who are filmed or photographed . Similarly it does not require affirmative evidence to establish a probability that the intelligence services of such states monitor the internet for information about oppositionist groups . The real question in most cases will be what follows for the individual claimant . If , for example , any information reaching the embassy is likely to be that a claimant identified in a photograph is a hanger - on with no real commitment to the oppositionist cause , that will go directly to the issue flagged up by art CARDINAL ) of the [ LAW ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a more recent judgment of ORG in ORG ( Demonstrators in GPE DATE risk on return ) ORG [ DATE ] ORG DATE ORG ) , the tribunal gave a new \u201c country guidance \u201d determination on returns to GPE in light of the post - presidential election violence . The case concerned an NORP national \u2019s sur place activities in the GPE The ORG considered the appellant to be a demonstrator whom the NORP authorities would particularly wish to identify and that there was a real risk that they would be able to do so . Additionally , because of the nature of his association with PERSON there was also a real risk that he would face ill - treatment which would amount to persecution because of his political beliefs . The ORG stated , inter alia , the following .", "\u201c CARDINAL Given the large numbers of those who demonstrate here and the publicity which demonstrators receive , for example on ORG , combined with the inability of ORG to monitor all returnees who have been involved in demonstrations here , regard must be had to the level of involvement of the individual here as well as any political activity which the individual might have been involved in GPE before seeking asylum in GPE .", "CARDINAL ( a ) NORP returning to GPE are screened on arrival . A returnee who meets the profile of an activist may be detained while searches of documentation are made . Students , particularly those who have known political profiles are likely to be questioned as well as those who have exited illegally .", "( b ) There is not a real risk of persecution for those who have exited GPE illegally or are merely returning from GPE . The conclusions of the ORG in the country guidance case of ORG ( risk on return DATE illegal exit ) GPE CG [ DATE ] UKAIT DATE are followed and endorsed .", "( c ) There is no evidence of the use of facial recognition technology at the NORP GPE International airport , but there are a number of officials who may be able to recognize up to CARDINAL faces at any CARDINAL time . The procedures used by security at the airport are haphazard . It is therefore possible that those whom the regime might wish to question would not come to the attention of the regime on arrival . If , however , information is known about their activities abroad , they might well be picked up for questioning and/or transferred to a special court near the airport in GPE after they have returned home .", "CARDINAL It is important to consider the level of political involvement before considering the likelihood of the individual coming to the attention of the authorities and the priority that the NORP regime would give to tracing him . It is only after considering those factors that the issue of whether or not there is a real risk of his facing persecution on return can be assessed . \u201d", "A number of factors were considered and placed under CARDINAL main heads : ( i ) the type of sur place activity involved ; ( ii ) the risk that a person will be identified as engaging in it ; ( iii ) the factors triggering inquiry on return of the person and ; ( iv ) in the absence of a universal check on all entering the country , the factors that would lead to identification at the airport on return or after entry .", "CARDINAL . In a recent judgment of ORG of DATE , the court considered the need for international protection based on sur place activity . The court stated that a real risk to be subjected to severe ill - treatment can be based on an applicant \u2019s sur place activity and that a comprehensive examination of all circumstances has to be made to determine such a risk . It was considered to be of particular importance whether the claimed activity was an expression and a continuation of opinions already founded in the country of origin .", "CARDINAL . ORG , in its legal statement of CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL(as referred to above ) , recognised that a risk based on sur place activity can constitute grounds for refugee status and asylum and listed the following factors to be considered in such assessment :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
