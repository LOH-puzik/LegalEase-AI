NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE . The President granted the applicant \u2019s request for her identity not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE with a visa granted by the NORP consulate in GPE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant sought asylum as well as the extension of her residence permit . She stated that her adoptive mother lived in GPE and that they were very close .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE , PERSON ) rejected her asylum application and decided to order her removal to GPE . In its reasons the ORG stated that the applicant \u2019s story contained conflicting information concerning , inter alia , with whom she had lived in GPE . Her story was thus not fully credible . The threats imposed by private parties were not as such sufficient grounds to grant asylum . Since DATE NORP women no longer needed permission from their father to marry and divorces had become more common in GPE . The police had a special unit for investigating domestic violence and a shelter system was in place for women . It was nowadays possible for a woman to live alone in GPE . The applicant had not shown any reason why she could not obtain protection from the NORP authorities if needed . Even though the applicant had taken part in student protests , she had not been arrested and her name was not known to the NORP authorities . It was not credible that she would be persecuted in GPE for political reasons . Nor was it credible that she would be persecuted due to the fact that she was married to an NORP man . As to the residence permit , the ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s adoption had not been registered in GPE . In any event , the applicant was an adult and could not be considered a family member of her adoptive mother .", "CARDINAL .

Even when the aunt moved to GPE in DATE , she had been in close contact with the applicant . In DATE the adoption had been registered in GPE . The applicant \u2019s adoption could be confirmed in GPE only when she had become an adult .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on the same grounds as ORG . This decision was served to the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant appealed further to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) requesting a stay on expulsion , which was not granted .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant was detained with a view to preparing her removal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a ORG found , when deciding on the applicant \u2019s detention , that the applicant \u2019s state of health prevented her removal at that time but that the removal could be enforced when her condition allowed it . She was released from detention on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was admitted to the closed ward of a psychiatric hospital due to psychotic depression . She was admitted at least until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police decided to detain the applicant again . However , this was not possible as the applicant was apparently still hospitalised .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in GPE . She was diagnosed as severely depressed , psychotic and suicidal . She was apparently hospitalised until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with the ORG , requesting that the removal to GPE be stayed . On DATE the ORG indicated an interim measure under LAW and held that the applicant should not be removed to GPE in the light of her physical and mental condition . The Government was requested to submit to the ORG independent medical evidence of the applicant \u2019s fitness to travel prior to the implementation of any possible future attempt to remove her .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government informed the ORG about the applicant \u2019s situation . The applicant \u2019s health had improved during the autumn and DATE but had deteriorated again in DATE when the police had asked for a new psychiatric evaluation . Since then the applicant had not been able to eat and had been suffering from severe sleeping problems . Her eating problems and suicidal tendencies were likely to lead again to hospitalisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW of Finland ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the right of foreigners to enter GPE and to remain in the country is regulated by an LAW . A foreigner shall not be deported , extradited or returned to another country , if in consequence he or she is in danger of a death sentence , torture or other treatment violating human dignity .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL b of LAW ( ulkomaalaislaki , utl\u00e4nningslagen ; Act no . CARDINAL , as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) incorporates into the NORP legal system the ORG CARDINAL of DATE on the organisation of joint flights for removals from the territory of CARDINAL or more Member GPE , of third - country nationals who are subjects of individual removal orders . The annex of the ORG contains common guidelines on security provisions for joint removals by air , including , inter alia , an obligation for the Member States to ensure that the returnees for whom they are responsible are in an appropriate state of health , which allows legally and factually for safe removal by air ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
