At the same time , he noticed that considerable efforts had been made to prepare the various detention facilities and the detainees for his inspections , which contradicts the very idea of independent fact - finding and unannounced visits .

He received many credible allegations of beatings with hands and fists , plastic bottles filled with sand , police truncheons , and of kicking , asphyxiation with plastic bags and gas masks used to obtain confessions from suspects . In several cases , these allegations were supported by forensic medical evidence .", "With regard to the legal framework and safeguards , the Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that torture has been criminalized , even if the current definition needs to be brought fully into line with LAW , and that safeguards are , by and large , provided for by the legislation and formally respected . In order for the safeguards to be effective , however , the various players in the criminal justice cycle must live up to their responsibilities , close the implementation gap and denounce cases of torture , which is currently not the case .", "In the light of the above , the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of GPE implement fully its obligations under international human rights law . In particular , he urges the Government to create an independent and effective national preventive mechanism with the necessary human and other resources and to view it as an ally in the collective effort to discover what really happens in places where people are deprived of their liberty . He also recommends that the penitentiary system be conceived in a way that truly aims at the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders . Complaints mechanisms need to be made accessible and credible ; a mechanism to investigate promptly and impartially allegations of torture and ill - treatment should be put in place and be independent of the alleged perpetrators ; the de facto time of apprehension should be recorded and terms of police custody reduced to international standards ; temporary detention isolators should be transferred from ORG to ORG ; and the burden of proof to show that a confession has not been extracted by torture should be transferred to the prosecutor . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
