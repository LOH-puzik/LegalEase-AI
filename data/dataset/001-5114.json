THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen born in DATE and resident in GPE .", "He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , solicitors practising in GPE , GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , a complaint was issued by the Procurator Fiscal for GPE charging the applicant with CARDINAL contraventions of section CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE and CARDINAL breaches of the peace in that he conducted himself in a disorderly manner persistently staring at CARDINAL young girls .", "On DATE the applicant pleaded not guilty at a pleading diet at ORG . He was represented by ORG , solicitors .", "The trial took place at ORG on DATE , DATE and DATE . The applicant was represented at the trial by PERSON , Advocate , engaged by the applicant \u2019s solicitors .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted in ORG on all CARDINAL charges , sentence being deferred for social inquiry and community service reports . On DATE , the applicant appeared before the Sheriff for sentence . He was now represented by PERSON , Solicitors . The ORG fined the applicant \u00a3 CARDINAL on each of the breaches of the peace and merely admonished the applicant on the statutory charges . The applicant , who claimed that his representation at the trial was so defective that he was not effectively represented , changed his representatives to appeal to ORG of Justiciary against conviction and sentence .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitor applied for an extension of the time in which to apply for a stated case to ORG of Justiciary .", "On DATE ORG of Justiciary granted the applicant an extension in time to apply for a stated case . On DATE , the application was submitted by the applicant 's solicitor , appealing against both conviction and sentence .", "In his application for the stated case , the applicant claimed that he suffered a miscarriage of justice under the Criminal Procedure ( GPE ) Act DATE , section CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , in that he was denied a fair trial as a result of defective representation at the trial . He made several allegations against his defence counsel , inter alia , that he had not presented the defence , had acted contrary to his instructions , has failed to challenge ORG evidence properly in cross - examination and had pressured him into not giving evidence .", "On DATE a hearing took place before the Sheriff to agree the draft stated case . On DATE the stated case , signed by the Sheriff , was sent to the parties to the appeal .", "On DATE the applicant was granted leave to appeal by a judge of ORG of Justiciary . This decision was notified to the applicant \u2019s solicitor on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s case was put down to appear on the appeal roll of CARDINAL DATE and the applicant \u2019s solicitor advised accordingly .", "The applicant 's solicitor contacted the applicant on DATE , informing him that the appeal hearing was fixed for DATE . On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitor informed him that a consultation with counsel had been fixed for DATE . This consultation lasted TIME . The applicant states that counsel informed him that she would ask for an adjournment as the views of the previous legal representatives had not yet been sought .", "During the appeal hearing on DATE , ORG upheld the appeal made by the applicant against the convictions under LAW DATE . As regards the applicant 's appeal against his convictions for breaches of the peace , counsel for the applicant sought an adjournment of the appeal on the basis that she had only very recently been instructed to represent the applicant and that she had advised him that certain information and various statements had to be obtained in the light of the requirements laid down by the court in PERSON v. ORG ( DATE J.C. CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL ) . This would have involved an affidavit from the applicant and any supporting witness setting out the full details of allegations and a response to complaints from the original agent ( solicitor ) and counsel . According to the ORG judgment , counsel stated that no necessary steps had been taken and that she could not offer the court an explanation as to why none of the investigation or preparation had been done .", "ORG refused to adjourn the appeal stating that it must have been obvious for DATE to the applicant and his present advisers that steps had to be taken in order to prepare the appeal to be advanced on the chosen grounds . It noted that the signed stated case was dispatched to the parties on DATE , that leave to appeal against conviction was granted on DATE and intimation thereof was sent to the applicant 's solicitor on DATE . It was therefore entirely unacceptable for the applicant to come forward at this late stage and , without explanation as to why none of the preparations required by the PERSON precedent had been done other than to instruct counsel on DATE of the appeal and seek a postponement of the appeal hearing in order to allow the necessary steps to be taken . It commented that while postponements had to be granted when adequate cause was shown and the failure to act timeously was explained , no explanation had been made in this case .", "Moreover , ORG stressed that it was important to avoid any unnecessary delay in the proceedings given that the events giving rise to the charge occurred in DATE and DATE , and the principal ORG witnesses were then young girls in their early teens . It noted that there had already been a delay in that the time had been extended to allow an application for a stated case to be lodged DATE after the conclusion of the applicant 's trial . Further , had the appeal been successful , the court would have had to grant authority to bring a new prosecution and the trial resulting from the new prosecution would have been unlikely to take place before the lapse of DATE since the commencement of the original trial in DATE . ORG concluded that it would sanction no further delay and dismissed the application .", "In her note of DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel recalled that the court had refused an adjournment as there had been no affidavit from the applicant detailing the failures alleged and no statements or approach had been made to his previous representatives . She had informed the court that she had not consulted with the applicant and solicitor until DATE before the appeal and the fault for the late consultation rested with her due to her court commitments . She could not offer any explanation for the absence of affidavits from the applicant and his relatives but informed the court that she had instructed that these be prepared . Once they had been obtained , the applicant \u2019s solicitor or ORG could have proceeded to contact the prior agents for their response .", "In her further note of DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel stated that no affidavits had been prepared when she met the applicant and his solicitor , PERSON , DATE before the appeal hearing . She had therefore advised that she would have to seek an adjournment . She did not recall if any explanation had been given to her for the failure to produce the information other than seeking the opinion of counsel as to how to proceed with the appeal .", "In his letter of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , the applicant \u2019s solicitor at the appeal , stated that as soon as he had been notified of the date of the appeal he had instructed his GPE agents to instruct counsel and sought a consultation . At the consultation he was told by counsel that further information was required and that she would seek an adjournment . She indicated to him and the applicant that they would not be required to attend the appeal hearing . He took the view that it was the role of ORG to seek the response of the applicant \u2019s previous representatives and that there had been no explanation from ORG as to the failure of ORG to do so in the applicant \u2019s case .", "The applicant received legal aid for his representation at trial and on appeal .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Defective representation as a ground of appeal", "In the case of PERSON v. ORG Advocate DATE SCCR CARDINAL , decided on DATE , ORG of Justiciary decided that , in certain circumstances , the conduct of the defence by the accused \u2019s counsel or his solicitor could be a ground of appeal . The conduct must have been such as to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice in that it deprived the accused of his right to a fair trial by not presenting his defence to the court . The accused might have been deprived of the opportunity to present his defence because his counsel or solicitor acted contrary to his instructions for example .", "The court noted that in such cases questions of fact might arise as to the nature and conduct of the defence and the court might require to hear evidence . Before it exercised this power , it had first to be satisfied that the complaint was of a kind likely to satisfy the test for a miscarriage of justice . It set out the preparation which it expected to be undertaken :", "\u201c difficult questions of professional practice may arise where allegations of this kind are made against counsel or a solicitor . It is essential therefore that those against whom the allegations are made are given a fair opportunity to respond in writing to these allegations before the court hears the appeal . The advocate or solicitor may , if he feels able to do so , provide a statement to the solicitor acting for the appellant to assist him and counsel in the drafting of the grounds of appeal . But he is under no obligation to provide any such statement . He may , if he prefers to do this , wait until the appeal is lodged and then lodge his statement with ORG . In all cases where a complaint is made against counsel or the solicitor who represented an appellant at his trial for which leave to appeal has been granted , ORG will advise counsel or solicitor of this fact , and will provide him with a copy of the ground of appeal so that he may respond to the allegations if he has not already done so . Once again we emphasise that he is under no obligation to respond at this stage to the allegation . But the court is likely to find it helpful to know whether the complaint is disputed and , if so , on what grounds , before it reaches a decision as to whether an inquiry into the facts will be necessary to decide the appeal . \u201d", "Courts\u2019 power to adjourn cases", "Unless otherwise expressly provided by statute , the courts have an inherent common law power to adjourn cases where it is considered necessary in the interests of justice and conversely to refuse to do so , also in the interests of justice .", "In general the courts will grant an adjournment that is requested by the defence if it is necessary to allow the defence to prepare their case ( ORG v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL PERSON and PERSON v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL ORG ) . The courts are less amenable to granting an adjournment on this basis if it is apparent that the accused or his agents had sufficient time and were in a position to carry out the necessary preparation for the trial but simply failed to do so ( eg . PERSON v. ORG SCCR CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
