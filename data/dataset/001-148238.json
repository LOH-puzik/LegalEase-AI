The first applicant , Mr T.H .- A. , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . The second and third applicants are his wife and child who are also NORP nationals and born in DATE and DATE respectively . The President granted the applicants\u2019 request for their identity not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The applicants were represented before the ORG by ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are a couple and their child born in GPE on DATE . They are NORP citizens originating from the FAC region and are NORP by religion . The first applicant had lived previously in GPE but fled from the war in DATE back to ORG . The second applicant , his wife , was born in GPE from where their family fled in DATE to GPE and from there to ORG in DATE . Both applicants claim that they have not been politically or religiously active and do not belong to any group .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s problems with the authorities started DATE . He was arrested , on the basis of witness testimony , by the local police in DATE , suspected of the murder of a police officer . After DATE in detention , the court ordered his release as the witness had retracted his statement . He was not , however , released immediately but only after DATE when his brother paid money to the police . The first applicant claimed that he had lost track of time while in detention as he was deprived of sleep . The interrogations went on continuously and if he fell asleep he was immediately awakened . A bag was put over his head to humiliate him and he was verbally humiliated as well . The first applicant claimed that he was not , however , otherwise physically ill - treated . He assumed that as he was relatively wealthy and well - known in his community , the police did not dare to beat him as it would have become known in the community .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant heard from the prosecutor that the witness testimony against him had been fabricated and ordered by the ORG ( ORG of GPE ) but the applicant did not know why . His legal counsel advised him to leave as , once targeted by the ORG , he would never be left alone . The first applicant did not want to leave as he did not consider himself guilty of any crime .", "CARDINAL . After his release , security troops of some sort ( silovikis ) searched his house . The first applicant escaped when he saw the military vehicles approaching his house . He went to live in his aunt \u2019s house QUANTITY drive from his house , where the applicants stayed for DATE ( in DATE ) until they fled to GPE . The house belonging to him and his brother was searched CARDINAL times and the applicants\u2019 passports were taken . The first applicant was never home when the searches were made but on CARDINAL occasion the second applicant was present . She and the other family members , who were at home at the time , were ordered to lie down on their stomachs on the ground for TIME while the men in military uniform , who did not specify who they were , waited for the first applicant to arrive . The men shot the applicants\u2019 kitten and stated that the applicants would soon be treated similarly . A gun was held to their heads and they were verbally intimidated . Finally the men tired of waiting and left .", "CARDINAL . The ORG left the first applicant CARDINAL written summons to present himself for questioning about his participation in group meetings and demonstrations . The first applicant stated that he had not participated in those meetings mentioned in the summons but that he only had participated in such meetings DATE before . His brother went to the ORG with a lawyer in DATE to tell them that the first applicant had left and would not be returning . The applicants maintained that they did not know why the ORG was after the first applicant . He assumed that he was on their blacklist for some reason but other people were also wanted by the ORG without any real reason .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant stated that her brother had also been taken by unspecified authorities in DATE without notice and held for DATE but then released . She did not know the reason . Her cousin \u2019s son had been reported missing since DATE . Her sister \u2019s husband had apparently also been killed after the applicants arrived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants also spoke in their asylum interview more generally about the human rights problems in ORG , such as house searches by masked men in military uniforms who always came in TIME , and unresolved abductions and killings . Some of the victims of these incidents were distant relatives or friends of the applicants .", "CARDINAL . After the applicants\u2019 arrival in GPE , the second applicant had suffered from several psychosomatic symptoms which were diagnosed as post - traumatic stress disorder . She has been treated with antidepressants which apparently have not improved her health . She submitted medical certificates to the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sought asylum in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG virasto , PERSON ) rejected their applications and decided to order their expulsion back to GPE . The Service did not consider it credible that the ORG could have been looking for the first applicant and failed to find him when he was still in Ingushetia and residing at his aunt \u2019s house CARDINAL minutes\u2019 drive from his own home . It also found it odd that the first applicant could not state any reason why he might be wanted by the ORG . Furthermore , the ORG noted that the ORG authorities had acted properly when releasing him from detention when there was no evidence against him and that they had not ill - treated him . According to the ORG , the first applicant was treated in a correct manner by the local NORP authorities . They also noted discrepancies , mostly in timing , in the applicants\u2019 stories concerning the searches of their home and the disappearance of their passports . Also , the applicants managed to leave the country without problems and their families had not been harassed after their departure . As the applicants had also themselves confirmed that they had not been politically or religiously active in their home country , the ORG did not find it likely that they would be of any interest to the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , also requesting an oral hearing to be held .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected both the appeal and the request for an oral hearing , considering the latter unnecessary as it found the applicants\u2019 story in principle credible and thus no additional information could be obtained by organising an oral hearing . However , it considered that nothing in the applicants\u2019 or in their family \u2019s background , gave reasons to suspect that they would be of special interest to the ORG . It also noted that , according to the country reports , it was possible that the first applicant might be targeted only because of the previous suspicion of criminal activity . However , it did not consider that to be enough to amount to a real risk of his ill - treatment upon expulsion . Furthermore , ORG noted that the first applicant had obtained a driving licence through his brother during his absence from GPE , thus it was unlikely that the authorities would persecute him . The court noted that the general security and human rights situation in PERSON was relatively poor but that it was not sufficient in itself to amount to a real risk of ill - treatment of the applicants . It also noted that mental health care was available in PERSON for the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicants appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting also an interim order to stay their expulsion for the duration of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

According to section CARDINALb of the LAW ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the well - founded fear of being persecuted referred to in section CARDINALb or the real risk of being subjected to serious harm referred to in section CARDINAL may be based on incidents after the applicant \u2019s departure from his or her home country or country of permanent residence or on acts that the applicant has participated in since his or her departure .", "CARDINAL .

ORG ) provides that the requirements for issuing a residence permit are assessed individually for each applicant by taking account of the applicant \u2019s statements on his or her circumstances in the ORG in question and of real time information on the circumstances in that ORG obtained from various sources .
