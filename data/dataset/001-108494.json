The ORG decisions on the invalidation of the election results in the CARDINAL constituencies concluded that there were \u201c unacceptable modifications performed on the protocols and law infringements which made it impossible to determine the will of the voters \u201d but did not provide any factual basis to support this conclusion . ...", "Furthermore , when it invalidated results , the ORG did not make the required initial factual inquiry [ as required by LAW ] , and ignored LAW , which authorizes the ORG to order a recount of votes in a constituency if the protocols and documents submitted by the ConEC reveal \u201c mistakes , inadmissible corrections and inconsistencies . \u201d Protocols of ConECs and PECs were not examined or reviewed at ORG sessions . Invalidation of results in a polling station was premised solely on the conclusion of an individual ORG member as to whether a protocol should be invalidated . The judgment of a single ORG member that there were deficiencies in the protocol was accepted as established fact without any explanation of the alleged defect or identification of the number of votes involved . Accordingly , there was no factual basis presented publicly for invalidating results in any of the CARDINAL constituencies , which is particularly troubling since the ORG registered few complaints that alleged violations in these constituencies . ...", "The adjudication of post - election disputes in the courts largely disregarded the legal framework , and fell short of internationally accepted norms . ...
