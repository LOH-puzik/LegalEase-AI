On DATE , as a consequence of his criminal convictions , ORG issued the applicant with a ban prohibiting his return to GPE ( R\u00fcckkehrverbot , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which was valid for DATE .

On DATE the Innsbruck ORG instituted proceedings to withdraw the applicant \u2019s subsidiary protection . On DATE it conducted an interview with him , during which he stated the following concerning his living situation in GPE . He had CARDINAL children , born in DATE , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE respectively . His parents , his CARDINAL siblings and their spouses and children all lived in the same city as him . His parents and his older brother were recognised refugees . He and his parents lived in the same house . He was working as a maintenance man and translator for NORP and NORP , and his wife was also working . Both had a regular income . His father still owned some land and CARDINAL shops in GPE , which were run by relatives at that time . The applicant stated that if he had to return to GPE he would not know what to do there or where to go . He had a \u201c bad feeling \u201d about returning , but did not fear any repression . The security situation was bad , and the views of society were primitive . His wife and children would not have to fear any problems upon returning to GPE , and would probably join him if he were expelled . He would , however , prefer to stay in GPE , where his children went to school .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG withdrew the applicant \u2019s subsidiary protection status under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Asylgesetz ) . It found that there was no longer a risk of a violation of the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW if he was returned to GPE , and declared his expulsion admissible . Quoting international sources , it explained that the security situation in GPE had significantly improved in DATE and was now considered to be stable . There was no threat from ORG ( ORG GPE ) anymore , which the applicant had initially alleged when applying for asylum .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW , ORG acknowledged how established his private and family life was in GPE , where his family members were living . However , it referred to his numerous convictions for crimes against life and limb as well as property , and concluded that the public interest in his expulsion outweighed his personal interest in remaining in the country . ORG specifically mentioned the CARDINAL convictions for drug offences in DATE and DATE , which it considered particularly serious . Further , it held that the applicant still had ties with GPE , because he had grown up there , spoke NORP , and was physically capable of working in order to earn a living . According to the applicant \u2019s own statements , his father still owned some land and CARDINAL shops in GPE , so it could be assumed that he could find work . Given that the applicant \u2019s wife had her own income , ORG further assumed that she would be able to take care of the needs of the family , and that the applicant could send her financial maintenance from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Asylgerichtshof ) confirmed the relevant parts of ORG decision . It held that , according to LAW in conjunction with LAW ) , the fines the applicant had received for his criminal convictions ( CARDINAL DATE rates in total ) , amounted to almost twentyfour months\u2019 imprisonment ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The actual prison sentences he had received amounted to DATE in total , which was considerable . ORG concluded that , even though the applicant had strong private and family ties in GPE , the public interest in his expulsion in order to prevent crime outweighed his personal interest in continuing his family life in GPE . He had reoffended even after he had been issued with the ban prohibiting his return to GPE , a fact which did not speak in his favour . Also , he could reapply for a residence permit in DATE when the ban expired .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with ORG . Among other things , he stated that CARDINAL of his daughters had in fact been born as a result of an extra - marital relationship with an NORP citizen , and was living with her NORP mother and not with him . The applicant claimed that it would be difficult to maintain contact with her if he were expelled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG then asked ORG to submit a statement regarding this new fact . ORG replied on CARDINAL DATE that the applicant had spoken of CARDINAL children throughout the proceedings , but had never mentioned that CARDINAL of them had in fact been born as a result of an extra - marital relationship and had never lived with him in the same household . He could continue to pay financial maintenance from GPE for his daughter . ORG expressed the view that the decision to declare the applicant \u2019s expulsion admissible was nonetheless proportionate to the aims pursued , as his family life with his illegitimate daughter was in any event much less established than that with his other family members .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to deal with the applicant \u2019s complaint . That decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was in pre - trial detention and prison from DATE ( in relation to the criminal conviction of CARDINAL DATE , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) until he was placed in detention pending his expulsion on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
