ORG had told the applicant to forget about PERSON , meaning that ORG had decided to kill him .", "CARDINAL . After their return to GPE , on DATE ORG had told the applicant over the phone that he could now forget about PERSON and that nobody would ever find him .

A typewritten transcript of a further interview of the applicant as a suspect dated DATE from TIME to CARDINAL a.m. indicated that the applicant wished to supplement his previous statement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that he had concealed the fact that he had sought the killing of ORG in order to obtain the ORG CARDINAL belonging to \u0122.\u010c. He had wanted ORG money because he had been experiencing serious financial difficulties . He had ordered parts for his sports car from GPE but did not have the means to pay for them .", "CARDINAL .

Both transcripts of the applicant \u2019s questioning recorded that he had wished to give a statement in the absence of a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and CARDINAL co - accused ORG , GPE and GPE were brought before ORG ( PERSON apgabaltiesa ) to stand trial on charges related to the murder of GPE", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found GPE and GPE guilty of aggravated murder . ORG established that GPE and PERSON had murdered PERSON on DATE , which they had partly admitted in the course of the trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG was unable to establish the guilt of the applicant and ORG", "CARDINAL . With reference to the applicant , ORG reasoned that at trial he had pleaded not guilty to the criminal offences he was charged with and recanted the statements he had given to the police . According to the applicant , he had provided these statements as a result of ill - treatment by police officers , who had beaten him and broken his nose . In this regard ORG reasoned :", "\u201c In assessing the [ applicant \u2019s ] explanation the court does not have a reason to not believe it , because , as is evident from the case materials , on DATE from CARDINAL TIME [ the applicant ] was questioned as a witness ... however ... he was taken into custody on DATE at TIME ... [ but ] he was not transferred to a detention facility until TIME on DATE , remaining in the LOC of the GPE police station ( PERSON rajona policijas p\u0101rvalde ) ...", "The fact that [ the applicant ] had been asked at TIME [ of DATE ] to attend the police station was confirmed by the witness [ ORG ] , an employee of ORG ( Organiz\u0113t\u0101s noziedz\u012bbas apkaro\u0161anas p\u0101rvalde ) ...", "The foregoing was also confirmed by witnesses [ A.B. ] , a police employee , and [ PERSON ] , an inspector , who were unable to explain to the court why [ the applicant ] had not been released from the police station after having been questioned as a witness .", "The fact that [ the applicant ] ... suffered bodily injuries while in custody is confirmed by the expert reports contained in the file ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In that light , ORG found that LAW had been violated with respect to the applicant , irrespective of the fact that the criminal case against the police employees had been terminated .", "CARDINAL . ORG also added that the applicant \u2019s statements of DATE had been contradictory . It deemed unreliable an expert report finding that there were no signs that the applicant had written the confession \u201c in the circumstances of anxiety , fear or physical ill - treatment \u201d . ORG reasoned that the expert report did not contain \u201c a study section \u201d ( izp\u0113tes da\u013ca ) that would allow it to understand how the expert had arrived at her conclusion .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , ORG ruled that the applicant \u2019s statements of DATE could not be used in the applicant \u2019s conviction .", "CARDINAL . It further held that no other evidence had been obtained to the effect that the applicant had in any way organised , assisted or incited another person to commit PERSON \u2019s murder . The evidence established that transactions involving money transfers had taken place between the applicant , GPE and \u0122.\u010c. This was corroborated by the evidence of witness GPE , a police inspector who testified about an ongoing criminal investigation into illegal transactions involving all CARDINAL individuals .", "CARDINAL . ORG in its judgment referred to telephone call records admitted in evidence . On DATE at TIME a phone call had been made from the applicant \u2019s mobile number to ORG \u2019s mobile number . At the same time , it reasoned that ORG had never testified having spoken on the phone to the applicant or having previously known him . In addition , ORG considered that it had no reason to conclude that ORG \u2019s testimony that he had used the applicant \u2019s phone in order to contact ORG about a vehicle had been false . It was evident from the telephone call records that on several occasions DATE and CARDINAL DATE V.Z. had been contacted from a number which according to ORG was his .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance judgment was appealed against to ORG of ORG ( PERSON tiesas GPE tiesu pal\u0101ta ) on behalf of the prosecution , the victim and both co - accused convicted at first instance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG overturned the applicant \u2019s acquittal and found him guilty of the aggravated murder of PERSON", "CARDINAL . NORP The judgment of ORG noted that in the appeal proceedings the applicant had continued to deny his initial statements and maintain that he had given them as a result of ill - treatment by police employees . In that regard , ORG reasoned as follows :", "\u201c ORG groundlessly ( nepamatoti ) accepted that [ the applicant \u2019s ] statements and [ his ] confession given during the pre - trial investigation were not truthful .", "The file does not contain impartial evidence affirming [ the applicant \u2019s ] assertion that he gave these statements as a result of physical and psychological ill - treatment by police employees , [ and ] that police employees dictated the testimonies [ to him ] . That it was merely a coincidence that during the commission of the crime [ the applicant ] was together with [ ORG ] ... [ and ] that a call was made from his phone at that time to [ ORG ] .", "The criminal case ... against police employees that they possibly had exceeded their powers and inflicted injuries on [ the applicant ] has been terminated and [ the applicant \u2019s ] defence has not disputed this decision ...", "ORG groundlessly rejected the expert report ... which concluded that the confession had been written by [ the applicant ] and [ that there was ] no indication ... of it being written in the circumstances of anxiety , fear or physical ill - treatment ... because the said expert report provides answers to the questions put to the expert . The expert report contains a study section providing the manner in which the expert reached the conclusion .", "Furthermore ... in comparing [ the applicant \u2019s ] complaint of DATE ... and the confession written on DATE ... [ there can be ] no doubt ... that it is [ the applicant \u2019s ] free style ( br\u012bvais stils ) [ of handwriting ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s statement of DATE to be admitted in evidence and relied on it in its judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , with confiscation of property and police control for DATE . The applicant was immediately taken into custody .", "CARDINAL . The defence lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG of the ORG of ORG ( PERSON tiesas ORG departaments ) , arguing that ORG had convicted the applicant in violation of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention because he had given the pre - trial confession and other statements relied upon by the court as a result of ill - treatment by police employees . The defence presented an extensive volume of evidence and pointed out that the applicant had been injured while in police custody and the circumstances of the injuries had not been explained . They submitted that there had been no other evidence in the file attesting to the applicant \u2019s guilt . The court had been under an obligation to assess the material in the criminal case against the police employees and not merely to rely on the fact that the case against them had been terminated . In the defence \u2019s submission , on DATE they had appealed against the decision terminating that criminal case . Pursuing appeal had subsequently become impracticable \u201c because the criminal case regarding the [ applicant \u2019s ] beating had been joined , as evidence , to the criminal case concerning [ ORG \u2019s ] murder \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG decided to dismiss the appeal without holding a hearing .", "CARDINAL . The decision of the ORG of ORG in its relevant part read as follows :", "\u201c ... contrary to the [ requirements of the ] Criminal Procedure Code , the appeals filed ... are not substantiated with [ submissions as to ] a violation of the said provisions of the law , but [ rather ] factual submissions are put forward [ with the aim of obtaining ] a re - evaluation of the evidence on which the appeals court \u2019s guilty verdict is based .", "...", "Pursuant to LAW ... the re - evaluation of evidence and establishment of new facts ... is not within the competence of the cassation court .", "The reference in the appeal on points of law to a violation of ... the relevant international Convention in the course of [ the lower court \u2019s ] adjudication is not based on the materials of this case and is therefore [ purely ] formal in nature . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
