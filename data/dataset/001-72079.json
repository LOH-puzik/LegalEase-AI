An insurance company paid the applicant a DATE allowance pursuant to ORG ( tapaturmavakuutuslaki , lag om olycksfallsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring ; DATE ) from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , and reimbursed medical expenses . The insurance company decided on DATE to cancel the DATE allowance as from DATE as it considered that the applicant \u2019s working capacity was reduced by CARDINAL PERCENT from that moment .", "In DATE the applicant sought medical treatment for pain in his left shoulder , right leg and back as well as for pain and tactile disturbances in his right arm . Medical certificates regarded him as unfit to work from DATE to CARDINAL DATE and from DATE to DATE due to pain in his left shoulder and left knee , sciatic symptoms in his right side , compression of nerve roots in his right arm and whiplash injury .", "The applicant applied for a DATE allowance and reimbursement of expenses as from DATE from the insurance company . On DATE the insurance company rejected the applicant \u2019s claims . It maintained that the distension of a spinal disc was not caused by the car accident . The company apparently considered that sciatic symptoms , which affected the applicant \u2019s lower limbs , were the principal reason for his incapacity to work as from DATE . It informed the applicant that it had transferred a medical doctor \u2019s opinion of DATE regarding some symptoms of sciatica to ORG ( vakuutusoikeus , f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ) which was examining a prior accident insurance claim regarding another accident on DATE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( tapaturmalautakunta , olycksfallsn\u00e4mnden ) .

The applicant appended CARDINAL medical opinions dated DATE and DATE respectively .", "ORG rejected the application on DATE . It held that the accident on DATE had caused whiplash injury and a spinal fracture , for which the applicant had received compensation until DATE , after which time the injuries no longer entitled him to a DATE allowance . It further held that the applicant \u2019s incapacity to work after DATE was caused by muscular tension in the neck , nerve root problems in the right arm , pain in the left shoulder and left knee as well as sciatic symptoms in the right side of the body , none of which were caused by the accident on DATE . It finally maintained that the accident in question had not worsened the applicant \u2019s pre - existing back illness .", "The applicant appealed to ORG repeating his claims . He argued that muscular tension in the neck , the nerve root problems in the right arm and pain in left shoulder were caused by the accident on DATE . He submitted a medical opinion dated CARDINAL DATE . The insurance company submitted its observations on the appeal and the applicant was invited to give a further response . On DATE the insurance company submitted an additional medical statement of DATE and a medical case history concerning the period from DATE . On DATE the applicant submitted an additional decision of CARDINAL DATE of the insurance company concerning his pension .", "On DATE ORG issued its decision accepting the reasons given by ORG and held that the new evidence presented to ORG did not give rise to any changes in the assessment of the case .", "The applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG . The leave to appeal was refused on DATE .", "Section CARDINAL of ORG ( hallintolaink\u00e4ytt\u00f6laki , f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslag , ORG ) provides that an appellate body must ensure that the case is examined properly .
