Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was therefore placed in an orphanage , ORG , where he grew up .", "In DATE Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was diagnosed as HIV - positive . He was later diagnosed with \u201c profound intellectual disability , an IQ of CARDINAL and HIV \u201d and was accordingly classified as belonging to the \u201c severe \u201d disability group . In time , he also developed associated symptoms such as pulmonary tuberculosis , pneumonia and chronic hepatitis .", "In DATE he was transferred to ORG and at DATE to the GPE no . CARDINAL ORG ( \u201c the LOC \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Panel \u201d ) ordered that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu should no longer be cared for by the ORG . The decision was justified on the grounds that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had recently turned DATE and was not enrolled in any form of education at the time .", "Although the social worker dealing with Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had recommended transferring him to the local Neuropsychological Recovery and Rehabilitation Centre , the ORG ordered that a competent social worker should take all measures necessary for Mr C\u00e2mpeanu to be transferred to ORG ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) . According to the relevant law , the decision could be challenged before ORG .", "Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was not present in person and was not represented at the hearing held by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s health was reassessed by ORG . The assessment resulted solely in a finding of HIV infection , corresponding to the \u201c average \u201d disability group . It was also mentioned that the patient was \u201c socially integrated \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on an unspecified date in DATE or DATE , a medical and welfare assessment of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was carried out by a social worker and a doctor from ORG as a prerequisite for his admission to a medical and social care centre . Under the heading \u201c Legal representative \u201d they indicated \u201c abandoned at birth \u201d , while the space next to \u201c Person to contact in case of emergency \u201d was left blank . The diagnosis indicated was \u201c severe intellectual disability , HIV - positive \u201d , without any reference to the previous diagnosis ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The following information was included in the assessment report : \u201c requires supervision and intermittent assistance with personal care \u201d , and the report concluded that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was able to take care of himself , but at the same time required considerable support .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , the ORG informed the ORG that it could not admit Mr C\u00e2mpeanu , who had been diagnosed with HIV and mental disability , as the hospital lacked the facilities necessary to treat individuals with such a diagnosis .", "CARDINAL . NORP Following this refusal , DATE and DATE the ORG and ORG for ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) contacted a series of institutions , asking for assistance in identifying a social care or psychiatric establishment willing to admit Mr C\u00e2mpeanu . While stating that the ORG had refused to admit the patient because he had HIV , ORG asked for the cooperation of the institutions concerned , mentioning that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s condition \u201c did not necessitate hospitalisation , but rather continuous supervision in a specialist institution \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG eventually identified the ORG and ORG ( \u201c the CMSC \u201d ) as an appropriate establishment where PERSON could be placed . In its request to the ORG , the ORG mentioned only that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was HIV - positive , corresponding to the average disability group , without referring to his learning difficulties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was admitted to the ORG . According to a report issued by the ORG and sent to the ORG on DATE detailing his condition upon admission , Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was in an advanced state of \u201c psychiatric and physical degradation \u201d , was dressed in a tattered tracksuit , with no underwear or shoes , and did not have any antiretroviral medication or information concerning his medical condition . It was noted that the patient \u201c refused to cooperate \u201d .", "In her statement to the prosecutor on DATE in the context of the domestic proceedings ( described in section B below ) , PERSON , the doctor who had treated Mr C\u00e2mpeanu at FAC , justified the failure to provide appropriate medication or information on the basis that she did not know whether , depending on the results of the most recent investigation ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it would be necessary to modify his treatment .", "A medical examination carried out upon Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s admission to the ORG concluded that he suffered from \u201c severe intellectual disability , HIV infection and malnutrition \u201d . At that time , he was QUANTITY tall and weighed QUANTITY . It was mentioned that \u201c he could not orient himself in time and space and he could not eat or care for his personal hygiene by himself \u201d .", "CARDINAL . During TIME DATE Mr C\u00e2mpeanu became agitated . According to the above - mentioned report by the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on TIME CARDINAL DATE he \u201c became violent , assaulted other patients , broke a window and tore up a mattress and his clothes and sheets \u201d . He was given phenobarbital and then diazepam to calm him down .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was taken to the ORG for examination , diagnosis and treatment , as it was the nearest psychiatric establishment . He was again diagnosed with \u201c severe intellectual disability \u201d . However , his condition was described as \u201c not a psychiatric emergency \u201d , as \u201c he was not agitated \u201d . PERSON diagnosed him with \u201c medium intellectual disability \u201d and prescribed sedative medicines ( carbamazepine and diazepam ) .", "According to the medical records kept at the ORG , no information regarding Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s medical history could be obtained upon his admission to the hospital , as he \u201c would not cooperate \u201d . In the statement she gave to the investigative authorities on DATE , PERSON from the ORG stated that \u201c the patient was different in that it was not possible to communicate with him and he had mental disabilities \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was returned to the CMSC on DATE , by which time his health had worsened considerably . At that time , the ORG had received a supply of antiretroviral medication and thus his treatment was resumed . Despite these measures , his condition did not improve , and his medical records noted that he continued to be \u201c agitated \u201d and \u201c violent \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG decided that because it lacked the facilities needed to treat Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s condition , it was impossible to keep him there any longer . The hospital sent a request to ORG asking it to refer him to a different establishment . However , ORG refused the request on the ground that he was already \u201c outside its jurisdiction \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC , the Director of the ORG , allegedly called ORG and asked it to come up with a solution that would allow Mr C\u00e2mpeanu to be transferred to a facility which was more suitable for the treatment of his health problems . It appears that she was advised to transfer him to the ORG for a period of DATE for psychiatric treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was transferred from the CMSC to the ORG , on the understanding that his stay at the ORG would last for DATE with the purpose of attempting to provide treatment for his hyperaggressive behaviour . He was placed in ORG V.", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was placed under the care of Dr L.G. Given the fact that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was HIV - positive , the doctor decided to transfer him to ORG . She continued to be in charge of his psychiatric treatment , as that department had CARDINAL general , non - specialist doctors and no psychiatrists on its staff .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr C\u00e2mpeanu stopped eating and refused to take his medication . He was therefore prescribed an intravenous treatment which included glucose and vitamins . Upon examination by the doctor , he was found to be \u201c generally unwell \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a team of monitors from the ORG visited the ORG and noticed Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s condition . According to the information included in a report by ORG staff on that visit , Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was alone in an isolated , unheated and locked room , which contained only a bed without any bedding . He was dressed only in a pyjama top . At the time he could not eat or use the toilet without assistance . However , the staff at the ORG refused to help him , allegedly for fear that they would contract HIV . Consequently , the only nutrition provided to Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was glucose , through a drip . The report concluded that the hospital had failed to provide him with the most basic treatment and care services .", "The ORG representatives stated that they had asked for him to be transferred immediately to ORG in GPE , where he could receive appropriate treatment . However , the hospital manager had decided against that request , believing that the patient was not an \u201c emergency case , but a social case \u201d , and that in any event he would not be able to withstand the trip .", "CARDINAL . PERSON died on TIME DATE . According to his death certificate , issued on DATE , the immediate cause of death was cardiorespiratory insufficiency . The certificate also noted that his HIV infection was the \u201c original morbid condition \u201d and designated \u201c intellectual disability \u201d as \u201c another important morbid condition \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In spite of the legal provisions that made it compulsory to carry out an autopsy when a death occurred in a psychiatric hospital ( Joint Order no . CARDINAL of the Minister of ORG and the Minister of Health ) , the ORG did not carry out an autopsy on the body , stating that \u201c it was not believed to be a suspicious death , taking into consideration the CARDINAL serious conditions displayed by the patient \u201d ( namely intellectual disability and HIV infection ) .", "CARDINAL . Unaware of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s death , on DATE the ORG had drafted several urgent letters and then sent them to a number of local and central officials , including the Minister of Health , the prefect of GPE , the mayor of PERSON and the director of ORG , highlighting PERSON extremely critical condition and the fact that he had been transferred to an institution that was unable to provide him with appropriate care , in view of his HIV infection ; the ORG further criticised the inadequate treatment he was receiving and asked for emergency measures to be taken to address the situation . It further stated that PERSON admission to the ORG and subsequent transfer to the ORG had been in breach of his human rights , and urged that an appropriate investigation of the matter be launched .", "On DATE the ORG issued a press release highlighting the conditions and the treatment received by patients at the ORG , making particular reference to the case of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu and calling for urgent action .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE to ORG , the ORG requested an update on the state of proceedings following the criminal complaint it had lodged with that institution on DATE in relation to the circumstances leading up to PERSON death ; in the complaint it had emphasised that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had not been placed in an appropriate medical institution , as required by his medical and mental condition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG lodged CARDINAL further criminal complaints , CARDINAL with the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG and the other with the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG . The ORG repeated its request for a criminal investigation to be opened in relation to the circumstances leading up to and surrounding Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s death , alleging that the following offences had been committed :", "( i ) negligence , by employees of ORG and of ORG ( LAW ) ;", "( ii ) malfeasance and nonfeasance against a person \u2019s interests and endangering a person unable to care for himself or herself , by employees of the CMSC ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) ; and", "( iii ) homicide by negligence or endangering a person unable to care for himself or herself , by employees of the ORG ( LAW and LAW ) .", "The ORG further argued that ORG had wrongly classified Mr C\u00e2mpeanu as being in the medium disability group , contrary to previous and subsequent diagnoses ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In turn , ORG had failed to institute proceedings for the appointment of a guardian when Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had reached the age of majority , in breach of existing legislation .", "Moreover , ORG had failed to supply the required antiretroviral medication to ORG staff when Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had been transferred there on DATE , which might have caused his death DATE .", "The ORG also claimed that the transfer from the ORG to the ORG had been unnecessary , improper and contrary to existing legislation , the measure having been taken without the patient \u2019s or his representative \u2019s consent , as required by LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) .", "Lastly , the ORG argued that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had not received adequate care , treatment or nutrition at the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the ORG that the case had been sent to the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG for investigation .", "On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG informed the ORG that a criminal file had been opened in response to its complaint , and that the investigation had been allocated to ORG of ORG ( \u201c the Police Department \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of the prosecutor \u2019s office , a forensic report was issued by ORG . Based on the medical records submitted , the report concluded as follows :", "\u201c Medical treatment was prescribed for [ the patient \u2019s ] HIV and his psychiatric condition , the treatment [ being ] correct and appropriate as to the dosage , in connection with the patient \u2019s clinical and immunological condition .", "It can not be ascertained whether the patient had indeed taken his prescribed medication , having regard to his advanced state of psychosomatic degradation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON body was exhumed and an autopsy carried out . A forensic report was subsequently issued on DATE , recording that the body showed advanced signs of cachexia and concluding as follows :", "\u201c ... the death was not violent . It was due to cardiorespiratory insufficiency caused by pneumonia , a complication suffered during the progression of the HIV infection . Upon exhumation , no traces of violence were noticed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG issued a decision not to prosecute , holding , inter alia , that , according to the evidence produced , the medical treatment provided to the patient had been appropriate , and that the death had not been violent , but rather had been caused by a complication which had occurred during the progression of PERSON HIV infection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG lodged a complaint against that decision with ORG of the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG , claiming , inter alia , that some of the submissions it had made concerning the medical treatment given to the patient , the alleged discontinuation of the antiretroviral treatment and the living conditions in the hospitals had not been examined .", "On DATE ORG allowed the complaint , set aside the decision of DATE and ordered the reopening of the investigation so that all aspects of the case could be examined . Specific instructions were given as to certain medical documents that needed to be examined , once they had been obtained from ORG in GPE , ORG , the ORG and the ORG . The doctors who had treated Mr C\u00e2mpeanu were to be questioned . The circumstances in which the antiretroviral treatment had or had not been provided to the patient while he was in the ORG and in the ORG were to be clarified , especially as the medical records at the ORG did not mention anything on that account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG decided that , pursuant to new procedural rules in force , it lacked jurisdiction to carry out the investigation , and referred the case file to the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to provide it with an opinion on \u201c whether the therapeutic approach [ adopted ] was correct in view of the diagnosis [ established in the autopsy report ] or whether it contains indications of medical malpractice \u201d .", "On DATE , ORG of ORG ruled that there were no grounds for taking disciplinary action against staff at the ORG :", "\u201c ... the psychotropic treatment , as noted in the general clinical observation notes from the ORG , was appropriate ... [ and therefore ] ... the information received suggests that the LOC decisions were correct , without any suspicion of medical malpractice [ arising from ] an opportunistic infection associated with HIV [ being ] incorrectly treated . \u201d", "That decision was challenged by ORG , but on DATE the challenge was rejected as out of time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG issued a fresh decision not to prosecute . The prosecutor relied in his reasoning on the evidence adduced in the file , as well as on the decision issued by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG lodged a complaint against that decision , submitting that the majority of the instructions given in the Chief Prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been ignored . The complaint was dismissed by ORG of the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG on DATE . The brief statement of reasons in the decision referred to the conclusions of the forensic report of DATE and ORG decision of DATE .", "On DATE the ORG challenged that decision before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG allowed the complaint , set aside the decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE and ordered the reopening of the investigation , holding that several aspects of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s death had not been examined and that more evidence needed to be produced .", "Among the shortcomings highlighted by the court were the following : most of the documents which were supposed to have been obtained from ORG in GPE and ORG had not actually been added to the investigation file ( the forensic documents on the basis of which Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had been admitted to the ORG and transferred to the ORG ; the clinical and paraclinical tests undertaken ; the records of questioning of the doctors and nurses who had been responsible for Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s care ; and the HIV testing guidelines ) . Contradictions in the statements of those involved in Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s admission to the ORG had not been clarified , and neither had the circumstances relating to the interruption of his antiretroviral treatment after being transferred to the ORG . In addition , the contradictory claims of medical personnel from the ORG and the NORP regarding PERSON alleged \u201c state of agitation \u201d had not been clarified .", "The investigators had also failed to ascertain whether the medical staff at the ORG had carried out the necessary tests after Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had been admitted there and whether he had received antiretrovirals or any other appropriate medication . The investigators had failed to establish the origin of the oedema noted on PERSON face and lower limbs and whether the therapeutic approach adopted at the ORG had been correct . Given these failures , the request for an opinion from ORG had been premature and should be resubmitted once the investigation file had been completed .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG appealed against that judgment . On DATE ORG allowed the appeal , quashed the judgment delivered by ORG and dismissed the ORG \u2019s complaint concerning the decision of DATE not to prosecute .", "The court mainly relied on the conclusions of the forensic report and the autopsy report , and also on the decision of ORG , all of which had stated that there had been no causal link between the medical treatment given to Mr C\u00e2mpeanu and his death .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the complaints lodged by the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE the prefect of GPE established a commission with the task of carrying out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding PERSON death . The commission was made up of representatives of ORG , ORG , ORG of ORG and the prefect \u2019s office . The commission was given DATE to complete the investigation and submit a report on its findings .", "The commission \u2019s report concluded that all procedures relating to Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s treatment after his discharge from ORG had been lawful and justified in view of his diagnosis . The commission found CARDINAL irregularity , in that an autopsy had not been carried out immediately after Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s death , in breach of existing legislation ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG filed a complaint with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , criticising several deficiencies concerning mainly the failure to appoint a guardian for Mr C\u00e2mpeanu and to place him in an appropriate medical institution . The ORG reiterated its complaint on DATE , submitting that the wrongful transfer of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu to the ORG could raise issues under LAW ( e ) of the LAW .", "In response to those allegations , ORG issued a report on DATE on the circumstances surrounding Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s death . ORG acknowledged that the ORG had acted ultra vires when ordering Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s admission to the ORG . However , it stated that in any event , the order had been of no consequence , given that the institution had initially refused to accept Mr C\u00e2mpeanu ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "ORG concluded that ORG had acted in line with the principles of professional ethics and best practice when it had transferred Mr C\u00e2mpeanu to the ORG . At the same time , ORG stated that it was not authorised to pass judgment on Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s subsequent transfer to the ORG .", "Similarly , ORG declined to express an opinion on the allegedly wrongful categorisation of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu as belonging to the medium disability group , or on the events which had occurred after his admission to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the ORG that a commission made up of various county - level officials had concluded that \u201c no human rights were breached \u201d in connection with Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s death , as his successive admissions to hospital had been justified by LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on measures for the prevention of the spread of HIV infection and the protection of persons infected with HIV or suffering from AIDS .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a criminal investigation concerning the death of CARDINAL patients at the ORG , ORG sent a letter to ORG , requiring it to take certain administrative measures to address the situation at the hospital . While noting that no criminal wrongdoing was detectable in connection with the deaths in question , the letter highlighted \u201c administrative deficiencies \u201d observed at the hospital and called for appropriate measures to be taken as regards the following problems :", "\u201c [ L]ack of heating in the ORG rooms ; hypocaloric food ; insufficient staff , poorly trained in providing care to mentally disabled patients ; lack of effective medication ; extremely limited opportunities to carry out paraclinical investigations ... , all these factors having encouraged the onset of infectious diseases , as well as their fatal progression ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE concerning a criminal complaint lodged by the ORG on behalf of another patient , GPE , who had died at the ORG , ORG and ORG dismissed an objection by the public prosecutor that the ORG did not have locus standi . It found that the ORG did indeed have locus standi to pursue proceedings of this nature with a view to elucidating the circumstances in which CARDINAL patients had died at the ORG in DATE and DATE , in view of its field of activity and stated aims as a foundation for the protection of human rights . The court held as follows :", "\u201c ORG considers that the ORG may be regarded as \u2018 any other person whose legitimate interests are harmed\u2019 within the meaning of LAW . The legitimacy of its interest lies in the ORG \u2019s request that the circumstances which led to the death of CARDINAL patients at the ORG in DATE and DATE be determined and elucidated ; its aim was thus to safeguard the right to life and the prohibition of torture and ill - treatment ... by initiating an official criminal investigation that would be effective and exhaustive so as to identify those responsible for breaches of the above - mentioned rights , in accordance with the requirements of ORG CARDINAL of LAW . [ It also aimed ] to raise the awareness of society as to the need to protect fundamental human rights and freedoms and to ensure access to justice , which corresponds to the NGO \u2019s stated goals .", "Its legitimate interest has been demonstrated by the initiation of investigations , which are currently pending .", "At the same time , the possibility for the ORG to lodge a complaint in accordance with LAW represents a judicial remedy of which the complainant availed itself , also in compliance with the provisions of LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG submitted an expert opinion , dated DATE and issued by Dr PERSON , a member of ORG and director of ORG ( ORG ) , assisted by PERSON , ORG at the ORG . The opinion was based on copies of the evidence which the ORG also submitted to the ORG , including the medical records from the ORG and the ORG .", "The expert opinion referred to the \u201c very poor , substandard , often absent or missing \u201d medical records at the ORG and the ORG , in which the description of PERSON clinical situation was \u201c scant \u201d . It noted that while at the ORG the patient had never been consulted by an infectiousdisease specialist . Also , contrary to NORP law , no autopsy had taken place immediately after the patient \u2019s death .", "Concerning the antiretroviral treatment , the documents available did not provide reliable information as to whether it had been received on a continuous basis . Therefore , as a result of inappropriate treatment , Mr C\u00e2mpeanu might have suffered from a relapse of HIV , and also from opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis pneumonia ( pneumonia appeared in the autopsy report as the cause of death ) . The opinion noted that pneumonia had not been diagnosed or treated while the patient was at the ORG or the ORG , even though it was a very common disease in HIV patients . Common laboratory tests to monitor the patient \u2019s HIV status had never been carried out .", "The expert opinion stated that certain behavioural signs interpreted as psychiatric disorders might have been caused by septicaemia .", "Therefore , the risks of discontinued antiretroviral treatment , the possibility of opportunistic infections and the patient \u2019s history of tuberculosis should have led to Mr C\u00e2mpeanu being admitted to an infectious - disease department of a general hospital , and not to a psychiatric institution .", "CARDINAL . The report concluded that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu \u2019s death at the ORG had been the result of \u201c gross medical negligence \u201d . The management of HIV and opportunistic infections had failed to comply with international standards and medical ethics , as had the counselling and treatment provided to the patient for his severe intellectual disability . Moreover , the disciplinary proceedings before ORG had been substandard and negligent , in the absence of important medical documentation .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is located in GPE in southern GPE , QUANTITY from GPE , on a former army base occupying QUANTITY hectares of land . The ORG has the capacity to admit CARDINAL patients , both on a voluntary and an involuntary basis , in the latter case as a result of either civil or criminal proceedings .
