SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in ORG . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are a married couple . The second applicant has a daughter , born in DATE . According to a report by the social authorities , made after the daughter \u2019s birth , the second applicant was not capable of forming an attachment to her daughter . The second applicant also has CARDINAL sons , born in DATE and DATE respectively . All CARDINAL children live with their respective fathers . The youngest son moved to his father after an investigation by the social authorities in DATE had led to the conclusion that his needs were not being met in the home of the applicants . Previously , the second applicant had received various forms of support from the authorities to enable her to take care of that son . The applicants also have CARDINAL sons together , born in DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively . The eldest and the youngest of the common sons live with the applicants .", "On DATE the applicants\u2019 second son , PERSON , was born , DATE prematurely . His twin brother was dead at birth . PERSON was thereafter treated at the hospital for serious complications . He had CARDINAL cerebral haemorrhages , a serious infection and a deformation of the lungs which made it necessary for him to lie in a respirator for DATE . Thereafter he was given oxygen until DATE . On DATE he was released from the hospital and moved home to his parents .", "On DATE personnel at the hospital in PERSON , where PERSON had been treated until that date , reported to ORG ( socialn\u00e4mnden ) in ORG that there were doubts as to the applicants\u2019 ability to take care of him . Similar observations were made at the hospital in GPE , where PERSON was treated after DATE .", "The ORG started an investigation into the matter . Having consulted hospital personnel , the applicants and the contact person who had been appointed to assist the applicants , the ORG concluded that there had been several serious incidents which indicated that the applicants were unable to handle unforeseen situations . While there had been no medical problems , PERSON had been given too much food and , as a consequence , he had had to undergo a medical examination . Moreover , the applicants were , in general , unable to understand and satisfy his needs regarding hunger , sleep and peace . The hospital personnel had had to give them a lot of support and inform them repeatedly how to take care of PERSON . The second applicant had made numerous telephone calls to the hospital , expressing anxiety about his eating and defecating habits . On DATE she had called the hospital several times as PERSON had been crying for TIME during TIME . She had stated that the situation was too much for her and her husband and that they wished to return him to the hospital . She was told that this was possible , but that CARDINAL of the parents had to stay with him , which they were unwilling to accept . The hospital personnel were also concerned about his older brother \u2019s situation . Having regard also to the results of the investigation in DATE , the ORG considered that the second applicant , who was on early retirement due to psychological problems , lacked the ability to establish a safe and secure connection to her children and to stimulate them . While the first applicant , an unemployed assistant nurse , had a better contact with the children , he was not able to take care of a child as demanding as PERSON without the support of his wife .", "On DATE , having regard to the results of the investigation , the ORG decided , pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Act with Special Provisions on ORG ( ORG med s\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om v\u00e5rd av unga , TIME ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) , to take PERSON into public care immediately on a provisional basis . He was placed with the contact person and her husband , acting as a so - called family home . The applicants had not given their consent to this measure . The decision was confirmed by ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE on DATE .", "On DATE ORG applied to ORG for a care order concerning PERSON under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and section CARDINAL of LAW . In the application , the ORG emphasised that PERSON was a very demanding child due to the medical complications that had occurred in connection with his birth , that he had a great need of rest and calm and that he depended on those in charge of him to observe and interpret his signals properly . The ORG maintained that the applicants were not able to meet PERSON \u2019s needs in an adequate way .", "The applicants stressed , for their part , that they had not had enough time to get over the difficult circumstances surrounding PERSON \u2019s traumatic birth , including the death of his twin brother , and that they had not been given the opportunity to prove that they were able to take care of PERSON .", "Following an oral hearing held on DATE , ORG , by a judgment of DATE , granted ORG application and issued a care order . The ORG agreed with the conclusions drawn by the ORG and found that there was a clear risk of impairment of the health and development of PERSON due to the applicants\u2019 inability to satisfy his needs . According to the court , they DATE in particular the second applicant DATE were incapable of understanding and following instructions about PERSON \u2019s feeding and of handling more demanding situations . It considered , with some hesitation , that he could not be cared for in the applicant \u2019s home with various support measures , as the applicants had not been able to take care of him despite having received help TIME per day from the social authorities . As the applicants did not consent to the placement in the family home , compulsory care had to be given under LAW .", "On DATE ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , which also held a hearing in the case , upheld ORG judgment . With reference to ORG report , the appellate court stressed that PERSON needed more care and nursing than children of his age normally did and that already at the hospital there had been doubts as to the applicants\u2019 ability to take care of him . Especially the second applicant had difficulties in understanding his needs and letting them prevail over her own wishes . According to the court , the investigation also showed that these difficulties had persisted when PERSON had left the hospital and moved home to his parents . Among other things , there had been deficiencies in his nourishment and feeding and he had not had enough peace and rest . The court also considered that the great number of telephone calls to the hospital showed that the applicants had not been able to handle the situation . The court found that PERSON \u2019s father had a better parental ability than his mother . Nevertheless , the investigation did not support the conclusion that the father \u2019s parental ability \u2013 even with the additional help from the social authorities DATE could compensate for the mother \u2019s deficiencies in this respect . Further , the court observed that , at the hearing , the mother had expressed a very negative attitude towards various support measures . It concluded that it was clear that PERSON had to be taken care of by other persons than the applicants in accordance with the ORG \u2019s care plan , namely in the family home .", "On DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "Subsequently , ORG DATE approximately DATE reconsidered PERSON \u2019s need of continuous care . On DATE the ORG decided that he should remain in the family home . It observed that he had developed in a positive way in the family home . Noting that PERSON visited his parents once or twice a week , the ORG considered that they were still unable to understand his situation and see to his needs .", "On DATE ORG again decided that the compulsory care should continue . The applicants appealed to ORG which , on DATE , following an oral hearing , upheld the ORG \u2019s decision . The court concluded that the applicants lacked the capacity to give PERSON the care that his great special needs required . The applicants did not appeal against the judgment .", "Further decisions that PERSON should remain in the family home were taken by ORG on DATE and DATE and on CARDINAL DATE . The decisions were based on reports which , inter alia , concluded that PERSON had a slow and delayed motor development and that his psychosocial development was also delayed . He needed a lot of help with most things , due to his age and his disabilities and required extensive stimulation and training in order to develop favourably . He had had regular and increased contact with his parents . While initially he had been accompanied by the foster mother on visits to the applicants\u2019 home , he had later begun to spend time with them alone and had even stayed TIME on some occasions .", "According to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and section CARDINAL of the DATE Act , compulsory public care is to be provided if there is a clear risk of impairment of the health and development of a person DATE due to ill - treatment , exploitation , lack of care or any other condition in the home and if the necessary care can not be provided with the consent of the young person \u2019s custodian . The decision whether to place a young person in public care is made by ORG following an application from ORG .", "Under section CARDINAL of the LAW , ORG may order the immediate taking into care of a young person ( \u201c provisional care order \u201d ) if it is likely that he or she needs to be provided with care under LAW and a court decision in the matter can not be awaited owing to the risks facing the young person \u2019s health or development or because the continuing inquiry can be seriously impeded or further measures prevented . A provisional care order shall be put before ORG which shall rule on whether the order shall be upheld pending the court \u2019s judgment regarding the application for public care ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
