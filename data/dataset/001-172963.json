ORG considered the criminal case DATE and DATE . During the proceedings the applicant , who was assisted by a lawyer , submitted that he and his presumed accomplice had indeed been in GPE on DATE and that they had indeed intended to commit a robbery in the bureau de change , but that they had changed their minds and returned to GPE DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment . The applicant was found guilty of armed robbery in the GPE bureau de change , committed jointly with GPE and resulting in the murder of CARDINAL persons . He was also found guilty of the unlawful purchase of a pistol and ammunition for it . ORG imposed the heaviest sentence available under LAW , namely a whole - life sentence . In accordance with section ORG ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s placement under the \u201c special \u201d prison regime .", "CARDINAL . Drawing on the evidence gathered during the preliminary investigation and at the trial , ORG established the facts as follows : the applicant \u2019s former partner , GPE , had started work as a cashier in the bureau de change in question in DATE when she was still living with him . While working there she had met the first victim , a certain GPE , who was a close relative of the owner and an employee in the same establishment . In DATE PERSON had left the applicant and moved in with GPE in GPE . The applicant had then decided to kill GPE and to steal the cash kept in the bureau de change . He had acquired a \u201c Makarov \u201d pistol , a silencer and ammunition . The applicant had persuaded a friend , GPE , to take part in the robbery . On TIME the applicant and FAC had arrived in GPE by coach . They had then gone to the building in which the bureau de change was located , and had gone up to the top floor to spend TIME there . TIME , TIME , they had gone down to the floor on which the bureau de change was located and noted that GPE was in the LOC alone . GPE , who had been carrying the pistol , had burst into the LOC and fired CARDINAL point - blank shot at the victim \u2019s left temple . The victim had died instantly . The CARDINAL accomplices had then placed the money found in the bureau de change in a bag which they had brought with them . Meanwhile the armed security guard of the bureau de change , a certain GPE , had rushed into the LOC where the first victim had been killed . GPE had fired QUANTITY shots at him , hitting him in the face . The security guard had been killed instantly . GPE and the applicant had left the building . They had then concealed the murder weapon under a rubbish bin , thrown away the clothes they had been wearing and hidden the stolen money . Some time later the CARDINAL men had ordered a certain FAC to fetch the money for them , which he had done .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment . He complained that insufficient reasons had been given for the conviction , that his guilt had not been established , that the first - instance court had reached an erroneous decision , that there had been several breaches of procedural and substantive rules under domestic law and that ORG had shown bias .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer requested the withdrawal of all the judges of ORG . He argued that the media coverage of the criminal case had created a climate of intolerance and hostility towards his client . The defence called for an additional witness to be summoned , the reexamination of CARDINAL of the witnesses already heard by the trial court , and several additional expert opinions . On DATE the reporting judge responsible for the criminal case rejected the requests for further evidencegathering as irrelevant . He dismissed the challenge to the judges of ORG for lack of any evidence of bias .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered the criminal case DATE . It examined a new witness and received additional conclusions from psychiatric experts on the mental state of the CARDINAL accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of the first - instance court , giving its full backing to the latter \u2019s factual and legal findings . The evidence gathered during the preliminary investigation , presented before the first - instance court and produced for the first time before ORG had demonstrated that the CARDINAL accused had planned and carried out the robbery in the bureau de change and that the CARDINAL victims had been killed by FAC Yet the applicant had been the instigator of those crimes and had provided the weapon used by his accomplice . ORG drew on the statements of the many witnesses questioned during the assessment of the case , on the results of the ballistic , technical and NORP reports and the medical and psychiatric opinions , and also on the physical and documentary evidence gathered .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the accused \u2019s initial statements during the preliminary investigation had differed considerably from their submissions to the first - instance court . The initial statements had corroborated the finding concerning their participation in committing the criminal offences in issue , whereas the subsequent ones set out a version of events to the effect that an NORP national had committed those offences . ORG gave credence to the accused \u2019s initial statements , which had been made to an investigator in their ORG presence after they had been formally charged . The CARDINAL individuals thus charged had been advised that their statements could be used in court with a view to establishing the facts , and their prior medical examination had revealed no sign of physical violence , which contradicted the defence lawyer \u2019s allegation that the applicant \u2019s initial confession had been extracted from him .", "CARDINAL . ORG turned its attention to the applicant \u2019s version of events to the effect that the CARDINAL murders and the robbery had been committed by a certain PERSON , an NORP national , and that the applicant himself had been at his place of work in GPE at the material time . Checks carried out in ORG database had shown that no NORP national of that name was present in GPE . It was true that the applicant had been at his place of work in GPE on DATE . However , he had been working as a night watchman and the robbery and murders had been committed early in the morning , which had given him enough time to cover the distance between GPE and GPE and to arrive at work TIME . ORG deemed unconvincing the statement by the only witness who had corroborated the applicant \u2019s version of events .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the judgment of the first - instance court displayed none of the procedural defects mentioned by the defence . The factual and legal findings of ORG had not been exclusively based on the accused \u2019s confessions but on the whole body of consistent evidence gathered during the criminal proceedings . The applicant had participated actively in the proceedings and his lawyers had submitted several requests linked to the progress of the trial and the gathering of evidence . ORG had responded to all those requests and had provided full reasons for its procedural decisions . There had , moreover , been no sign of bias on the part of the judges who had examined the case , and the proceedings had been conducted in such a way as to safeguard the parties\u2019 interests .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal excluded a statement by CARDINAL witness from the evidence for non - compliance with the procedural rules , but did not consider that statement decisive in terms of the factual and legal conclusions in the case . It held that even though ORG had been dilatory in issuing the grounds for its judgment , the defence had nonetheless been able to submit additional observations on appeal after having secured a copy of those grounds .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , reiterating his submissions to ORG . In that appeal , which ran to CARDINAL pages , his lawyer raised CARDINAL objections concerning the gathering and the interpretation of various pieces of evidence , as well as the factual and legal findings of the lower - level courts . In paragraph CARDINAL of his submissions the lawyer contested the admissibility of a record of a reconstruction of the events of DATE , arguing that on DATE his client had not been assisted by a lawyer of his choosing . At the time his client had been assisted by an officially appointed lawyer who had not been nominated by the local bar association , as required by the applicable legislation . The applicant \u2019s lawyer added that his client had undeniably been deprived of a defence lawyer on DATE , when he had been taken into custody ; he regarded this as an infringement of the provisions of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG and of the LAW . That was the only sentence relating to the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s detention in police custody .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It found that none of the circumstances mentioned by the defence demonstrated the existence of bias on the part of the judges who had considered the criminal case . The applicant had had an opportunity to defend himself effectively during the criminal proceedings : he had given evidence and challenged the evidence against him . Some of his requests for further evidence - gathering had been accepted by the lower - level courts , and proper reasons had been given for their rejection of other requests by the defence for evidence to be taken .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in endorsing ORG other arguments , ORG considered that the facts had been well established , that the substantive and procedural rules had been appropriately applied and that the accused \u2019s rights had been fully respected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was held in ORG from DATE to DATE , and again from DATE to DATE . He was incarcerated in FAC from CARDINAL DATE to DATE , and again from DATE to DATE . On DATE he was transferred to FAC , where he is still being held .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that he had been held in a cell without windows , a toilet or running water . The LOC had had poor ventilation and lighting . He had not been allowed to exercise in the open air . Access to sanitary facilities had been restricted and the time allowed for washing had been insufficient . The applicant emphasised that the conditions of hygiene in the detention facility had been deplorable . He had subsequently been moved to another cell with CARDINAL other detainees . The CARDINAL detainees had had to take turns sleeping because the cell only had one bench .", "CARDINAL . According to a rapport by the Director General of Prisons submitted by the Government , at the time the only furniture in the cells in ORG had been a bench . The cells had had no windows and the only daylight had entered through holes in metal plates affixed to the doors . The facility in question had only had CARDINAL shared washroom and lacked any open - air facilities for detainees . The report also mentioned that DATE the facility had been completely renovated and redeveloped to bring the conditions of detention into line with the GPE human dignity .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that his cell in FAC had had a surface area of QUANTITY m. It had contained a bed and a metal rack . There had been neither running water nor a toilet in his cell . He had used a plastic bucket for his bodily functions . Like all the prisoners he was allowed out of his cell for TIME CARDINAL times a day , in order to empty the bucket and fill his water bottle . The applicant submitted , in support of those allegations , a statement by his co - accused GPE , who had been detained with him under the same conditions in FAC . The applicant added that he had been forced to wear a convict \u2019s uniform even though he should have been allowed to wear his own clothes , under the prison rules .", "CARDINAL . The applicant explained that at the beginning of his term in FAC he had been deprived of open - air exercise . According to ORG statement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , prisoners were allowed TIME open - air exercise every other day . The applicant was not involved in any organised activities in FAC . He had submitted several requests to the prison authorities to allow him to join in the various vocational training and occupational programmes and had applied for a transfer to FAC in order to be closer to his family , but no action had ever been taken on his requests .", "CARDINAL . According to a report by the governor of ORG submitted by the Government , the applicant had problems adapting to the prison regulations ; his attitude to the wardens and the prison authorities had been refractory and disrespectful . However , the applicant had enjoyed all the rights afforded to persons deprived of their liberty . He had board and lodging in accordance with normal prison standards . He had open - air exercise every day and free access to the prison library . He had consulted a psychologist on several occasions and had had a number of meetings with the prison \u2019s activity coordinator .", "CARDINAL . Following his transfer to FAC the applicant was subject to the \u201c special \u201d prison regime , involving virtually total isolation from the rest of the prison population .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that over the period from DATE to DATE he had been confined to a cell measuring QUANTITY , which he had shared with another prisoner . The CARDINAL beds had taken up most of the floor area , leaving the QUANTITY prisoners with a free area of QUANTITY m. There had been no running water in the cell and the prisoners had used a bucket as a toilet .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that he had spent most of DATE sitting on his bed for lack of free space in the cell . He had eaten his meals in the cell and had been allowed to walk in the prison yard for TIME every day . His access to the prison library had been limited to TIME it took to choose and borrow a book , after which he had been immediately taken back to his cell . He had been allowed to attend the prison chapel twice a year , at GPE and DATE , although not during worship so that he would not meet other prisoners .", "CARDINAL . Up until DATE the high - security wing of the prison had been overcrowded and ill prisoners had not been held separately from other prisoners , which had fostered the transmission of infectious diseases . The physical conditions had improved somewhat after the renovation work in the high - security wing in DATE and DATE . In DATE the applicant \u2019s prison regime had relaxed . However , like all prisoners in his category , he had still been kept separate from the rest of the prison population and his cell had been kept locked during DATE . In DATE and DATE he had occasionally worked in his cell folding envelopes . Since DATE he had been allowed into an activities room , where he could talk to other life prisoners and read books .", "CARDINAL . According to a report by the governor of PERSON dated DATE , the high - security wing of FAC had been completely renovated in DATE and DATE . On the date of the report in question the applicant had been held in an individual cell measuring QUANTITY . m. , with a bed , a table , a rack , a shower and a private toilet . His cell had been heated and had running water and proper lighting .", "CARDINAL . Apart from the restrictions imposed by his prison regime , the applicant had access to all the activities provided to other prisoners : he could work , visit the library and the prison chapel , receive visits from his relatives , and write and receive letters . He was also eligible for relaxation of his prison regime under section CARDINAL of LAW , subject to a favourable opinion from the relevant special panel , and could ultimately be accommodated with the rest of the prison population .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in DATE the applicant applied to have a number of the provisions of the implementing regulations of LAW declared void as regards the conditions for the execution of his life sentence . His application was dismissed with final effect by a judgment of DATE delivered by ORG , which found that the impugned provisions of the implementing regulations were not contrary to LAW and that the adoption of the regulations had not involved any irregularities justifying their being declared void ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"]}
