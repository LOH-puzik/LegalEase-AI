It is represented before ORG by PERSON , ORG , lawyers practising in GPE .", "In DATE Mr PERSON , deputy mayor of ORG and member of ORG of ORG ( ORG ) , published in the municipality \u2019s party magazine \u201c ORG \u201d , inter alia , the following phrase :", "\u201c They are sitting in ORG where a minister really ought to work for the benefit of the Land , but instead they are sabotaging the work of the Land from within ORG . ( PERSON in GPE , PERSON in GPE ) . \u201d", "Subsequently , PERSON , Minister of ORG ( NORP PERSON ) , lodged injunction proceedings under LAW ( ORG ) against PERSON . The proceedings were settled with the following disclaimer published by PERSON in the above party magazine :", "\u201c I wrote in the DATE issue of ORG ( ... ) that the Minister of the Freedom Party PERSON \u2018 would sabotage the work of the Land from within the Regional Government\u2019 . I have assured myself of the fact that that is untrue and I , thus , withdraw this reproach against Minister PERSON with sincere regret . Furthermore , I declare not to repeat this statement . \u201d", "Thereupon , the applicant published in no .

It noted in particular that the reproach against the claimant of having lied constituted defamation as it could not be established from his disclaimer that he had deliberately told the untruth when making the statement about the \u201c sabotage \u201d in ORG . Further , the implied suggestion to the reader not to believe him in the future was capable to lower him in the public esteem . Though politicians had to display a higher degree of tolerance against criticism than private individuals , the reproach in the present case aimed at ridiculing and mocking the claimant , which exceeded the degree of lawful criticism against a politician .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against this sentence , complaining in particular that the court had failed to consider the above article in the light of the political criticism lodged by the claimant against Mr Schimanek . Therefore the article at issue constituted political criticism , lawful within the meaning of LAW .", "On DATE ORG , after having held a hearing , attended by the claimant and the applicant \u2019s lawyer , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and confirmed ORG sentence . The court found that withdrawing criticism against a political opponent did not constitute a sufficient factual basis for a reproach against a municipal politician of having deliberately told the untruth . In the present case the claimant , a deputy mayor who was not in the very centre of the public eye , had in the court \u2019s view , \u201c quasi \u201d apologised to Minister PERSON , which did not therefore raise the limits of lawful criticism . Furthermore , the claimant had stated in the proceedings that he had made his disclaimer in ORG on strategic procedural grounds and because he had obtained the TIME of a meeting where ORG , PERSON PERSON , had acknowledged good co - operation within ORG .
