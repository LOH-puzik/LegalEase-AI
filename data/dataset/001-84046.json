On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed multiple gang rape ( including statutory rape ) , of inducing the victims to take intoxicants and of persuading the victims not to inform the police about those crimes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was remanded in custody by ORG . The decision was based on a reasonable suspicion , confirmed by testimonies of the victims and of other suspects , that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged , the severity of the sentence he faced and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation . The court pointed to a serious risk that the applicant , if not detained , might attempt to influence the co - accused and the victims .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , CARDINAL other persons were charged with participation in the crime and CARDINAL of them were remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL .

The court found that the grounds for detention on remand were still valid and owing to the fact that the crimes had been committed in co - operation with other persons , there remained a high risk that the applicant might interfere with the course of justice and exert pressure on witnesses and victims . The courts also pointed to the necessity of separating the suspects . As the investigation continued , the court stated that there had been exceptional circumstances which precluded the termination of the preparatory proceedings , such as the complexity of the case , the need to obtain further evidence and the multiplicity of plots , accused and charges . The court also found that the applicant 's case had not disclosed any of the grounds for release provided for by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the prosecutor decided to include in the case file the case files of other proceedings conducted against the suspects .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the public prosecutor ordered expert opinions on the kind of injuries the victims had suffered and whether these might have resulted from the circumstances described by them , and on the ability of the suspects to understand the meaning of their acts and to control their behaviour at the time when the offences had been committed .

On the same date the public prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment comprising CARDINAL charges and CARDINAL victims . The applicant was charged with CARDINAL offences : participation in an organised criminal gang , gang rape ( including statutory rape ) committed with extreme cruelty and in conjunction with deprivation of liberty , and with threatening the victims and persuading them not to inform the police about the crimes .", "CARDINAL .

The court remanded in custody CARDINAL of the defendants who had failed to appear at a hearing and lifted the detention of another . It also dismissed from his function a legal - aid lawyer who had failed to appear and appointed a new CARDINAL in his place .

At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE the court prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . The court emphasised that the absence of CARDINAL of the defendants prevented the hearing of the other accused and that detention was the only preventive measure which could in those circumstances secure the proper conduct of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the psychologist submitted an opinion in which he considered that it was inadvisable to hear the victim , since this would oblige her to re - live her traumatic experience .", "CARDINAL .

It was proved that CARDINAL of the defendants had exerted improper pressure on witnesses and thus caused them to alter significantly their versions of the events . The court noted that the case involved CARDINAL defendants and CARDINAL witnesses . Owing to the considerable amount of evidence to be taken , it was inevitable that the proceedings had been prolonged , given the need to ensure that the right to a fair trial was fully respected . At this point the court emphasised that the defendants had been making extensive use of their rights to question witnesses . Several witnesses had changed their testimonies and the reading out of their earlier statements had been justified . TIME witnesses remained to be heard at that stage of the proceedings and there was a need to summon further witnesses and to cross - examine them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . The court endorsed the reasoning of the first - instance court in the latter 's decision of DATE . In addition , it dealt with the length of the proceedings . The court noted that , since DATE , the first - instance court had held CARDINAL hearings and examined CARDINAL witnesses . The absence of other witnesses was the major reason for the prolongation of the proceedings ; however , the trial court had taken proper measures to speed up the trial . The appellate court also pointed to the fact that the examination of the witnesses had been very time - consuming owing to the complexity of the case and the mental state of the victims . The parties had also requested additional witnesses to be heard .", "CARDINAL . Three hearings were held in DATE , despite the absence of some of the defendants at CARDINAL of the hearings . A number of absent witnesses were ordered to be brought to court .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL further hearings were held in DATE .

Consequently , the defendants ( among them the applicant ) made CARDINAL applications for the examination and cross - examination of witnesses , the ordering of expert opinions and inspections of the crime scene .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG decided to prolong the applicant 's detention . The court held that the considerable length of the proceeding was due to the complexity of the case coupled with the large number of accused and witnesses . The court concluded that the prerequisites for detention provided for by LAW applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held a hearing despite the absence of CARDINAL defendants . A witness was ordered to come to the hearing . The court also obliged the defendants to specify their reasons for requiring the cross - examination of witnesses .", "CARDINAL .

From DATE until DATE the applicant was serving a prison sentence imposed on him in separate proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Up to DATE QUANTITY hearings had been held during which the court took evidence from further witnesses and an expert . CARDINAL witness was examined at his place of residence and the testimonies of CARDINAL other witnesses , who were abroad , were read out .
