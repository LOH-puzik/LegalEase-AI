The applicant , a NORP citizen born in DATE , is a businessman residing in PERSON in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s son founded the ORG , a construction company , whereby the applicant acted as guarantor ( PERSON ) for a credit . He also assisted his son in various administrative tasks concerning the company .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the GPE company went bankrupt . ORG ( Ausgleichskasse ) of ORG suffered losses in particular as to contributions of the company to the old age insurance scheme . ORG regarded the applicant as being the administrative and commercial manager of the company and therefore liable for the sum of MONEY ( CHF ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant objected , whereupon on DATE and DATE ORG introduced a compensation action against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP The action was upheld on DATE by ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) of ORG which nevertheless reduced the amount to CHF CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In its decision , ORG referred , inter alia , to the statement of a certain PERSON , a former member of the board of the company , according to which the applicant had granted the company an advance payment . ORG then examined whether the applicant had in fact had the position of an executive ( Organ ) of the company and whether in this respect it was necessary to hear the witnesses PERSON . R and PERSON The decision referred , inter alia , to CARDINAL letters of the applicant to ORG , i.e. , of DATE in which he stated that the company no longer had any assets , and of DATE in which he had signed \" as a representative \" . As a result , the ORG concluded that the applicant had in fact had the position of an executive of the company , for which reason further evidence was not necessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an administrative law appeal with ORG ( Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Versicherungsgericht ) , contesting the action , and requesting the hearing of various witnesses , inter alia , PERSON . NORP and PERSON as well as ORG where he had introduced proceedings against a certain R.H.", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal was transmitted for observations to ORG of ORG , ORG of ORG , and ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG of the Canton of Schwyz submitted its observations on the applicant \u2019s administrative law appeal to ORG , the statement numbering CARDINAL pages . ORG proposed in particular the dismissal of the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "In its statement ORG commenced with a \" preliminary remark \" according to which the applicant had not , in the administrative proceedings , referred to the separate procedure before another court concerning a certain PERSON As a result , ORG had not regarded it necessary to consult that case - file , and it could not be said that ORG had not sufficiently examined the facts . ORG further stated that the applicant had implicitly admitted that he was an executive of the GPE company when filing the letters of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the submissions of ORG , it further transpired from separate execution proceedings that various foreign currency deals had been transacted by the applicant \u2019s family over the GPE , leading to returns of CHF MONEY . However , the ORG was concerned with constructions , not with foreign currency deals . It could not be said that the applicant had not been in a position to take decisions with binding legal effect . ORG also considered it unnecessary to hear the witnesses PERSON . NORP and PERSON Thus , in its decision it had considered that the CARDINAL witnesses were quarrelling with each other , and the applicant had not shown in what respect the hearing of these witnesses would be useful .", "CARDINAL . ORG submitted a similar statement , whereas ORG did not file any submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG transmitted the statement of ORG to the applicant for information , expressing its regret that it had by mistake not done so earlier on .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a statement on the submissions of ORG of DATE . The front page read :", "\" the observations contain three important new points which were not contained in the decision of ORG . I could not therefore make any observations thereupon in my administrative law appeal of DATE . As a result , it must be possible for me now to make such observations which I am herewith submitting . \"", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant then pointed out that ORG had stated that he had never mentioned a further set of proceedings against a certain PERSON This was a new point . He had only found out about PERSON in the decision of ORG itself , for which reason he could not have commented thereupon in the proceedings before ORG . The applicant furthermore pointed out that ORG had made new submissions when stating that in view of his letters of DATE and DATE he had effectively accepted having the position of an executive of the ORG company .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the applicant explained that ORG submissions were also new to the extent that reference was made to foreign currency deals . This information came from the separate proceedings before ORG , ORG , and not from him . To the extent that ORG concluded on the basis of this information that the applicant had , in fact , had the position of an executive , he should have been permitted to comment on this point .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s administrative law appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision first recalled the procedure before ORG itself , noting in particular that the applicant had submitted further observations on CARDINAL DATE without being requested to do so . The court then noted that according to LAW of LAW ( Organisationsgesetz ) , observations were only exceptionally exchanged a second time between the parties . The decision continued :", "\" ( Such a second exchange of observations ) will be required for reasons of a fair hearing if in the observations new factual statements have been made , the correctness of which does not immediately transpire from the case - file and which are of relevance for the decision . As regards new legal arguments it must be borne in mind that ORG is called upon ex officio to apply the correct law . The mere fact that these observations refer to supporting arguments in addition to those mentioned in the contested decision can not justify the possibility to reply thereto . It would be different , if ORG were of the opinion that the contested decision could be upheld , not with the reasons originally given , but with other reasons , now mentioned in the observations ...", "In the light of these principles the applicant \u2019s request along these lines , namely to have a second exchange of observations , appears unfounded . It is irrelevant in this respect that the observations of ORG were only submitted belatedly ( nachtr\u00e4glich ) . Thus , in those observations no new factual or legal points were raised : Rather , the circumstances mentioned by the applicant ( statement of NORP about advances paid to the capital of the company ; profits from currency deals ) disclose that they were already known in the case - file stemming from the proceedings of the PERSON and PERSON execution authorities and thus clearly transpired from the file . Therefore , the applicant could , and ought to , have prepared everything necessary in order to avoid a second exchange of observations ... Furthermore , the new point of the previous court which he has mentioned , regarding his executive position , merely concerns an additional argument which further supports the grounds mentioned in the contested decision . This does not warrant the possibility of a further reply . As a result , the applicant \u2019s observations , submitted without being so requested , can not be legally considered ( aus dem Recht zu weisen ) . \"", "CARDINAL . Insofar as the applicant complained that certain witnesses had not been heard , ORG considered , inter alia , that ORG had pertinently mentioned the circumstances under which a company executive became liable for the company \u2019s debts . In respect of the witnesses PERSON . NORP and PERSON , the hearing of which had been requested by the applicant , ORG referred to the accurate observations filed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW of LAW ( Organisationsgesetz ) , ORG is called upon to examine administrative law appeals against cantonal decisions in last resort concerning matters of social insurance . In principle , the court is free to establish the facts . However , according to LAW , it considers itself bound by the facts if the lower instance which determined them was a court to the extent that the determination is not manifestly incorrect , incomplete or in breach of essential procedural rules . As a result , there is only a limited possibility to put forward new facts in the proceedings before ORG ( see Bundesgerichtsentscheide [ ORG ] CARDINAL V CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the administrative law proceedings before ORG there is , in principle , CARDINAL exchange of statements in which the other parties and instances concerned may file their observations on the administrative law appeal ( LAW of LAW ) . According to the practice of ORG , a second exchange of statements will take place if new facts transpire in the observations the correctness of which can not be established in the case - file and which observations appear pertinent for the final decision . If new legal considerations are raised for the first time in these observations , a second exchange of statements will take place if the contested decision can no longer be based on the reasons given by the lower court ( see ORG CARDINAL ; CARDINAL ORG ; CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL ; CARDINAL I CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
