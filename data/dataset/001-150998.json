The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s loss of capacity to work was assessed to be CARDINAL per cent as of DATE , and she was granted a disability pension ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . This assessment was maintained in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to a modification of the applicable methodology but apparently without any substantial change in her health , the level of the applicant \u2019s disability was changed to MONEY on DATE . Without envisaging her rehabilitation , the assessment panel scheduled the next check - up of her medical status for DATE .", "As a consequence of her MONEY level of disability , her entitlement to the disability pension was withdrawn as of DATE .", "The applicant challenged this decision in court , but ORG dismissed her action on DATE , notwithstanding an expert opinion stating that the applicant \u2019s condition had not improved since DATE . The applicant was obliged to reimburse the amounts received after CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant requested another assessment of her disability . In DATE the first - instance authority assessed it at MONEY , scheduling the next assessment for DATE . The second - instance authority changed this score to MONEY , with a reassessment due in DATE . Such a level would have entitled her to disability pension , had her rehabilitation not been possible ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , this time the assessment envisaged the applicant \u2019s rehabilitation in a time - frame of DATE , during which time she was to receive rehabilitation allowance .", "CARDINAL . As of DATE , a new law on disability allowances ( Act no . ORG of DATE ) entered into force . It introduced additional applicability criteria ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Notably , instead of fulfilling the service period required by the former legislation , the disabled person must have DATE covered by social security in DATE the submission of his or her request . Persons who do not meet this requirement may nevertheless qualify if they had no interruption of social cover for DATE throughout their career , or if they were in receipt of a disability pension on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant submitted another request for disability allowance . Her condition was assessed in DATE , leading to the finding of MONEY disability . On DATE her request was dismissed because she did not have the requisite period of social cover . Rehabilitation was not envisaged . The next assessment was scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant submitted a fresh request for disability pension under the new law on disability allowances and underwent another assessment in which the level of her disability was again established at MONEY . Rehabilitation was not envisaged .", "CARDINAL . In principle , such a level of disability would entitle the applicant to a disability pension under the new system . However , since her disability pension had been terminated in DATE ( that is , she was not in receipt of a disability pension on DATE ) and , moreover , she was not in a position to accumulate the requisite number of DATE covered by social security or to demonstrate an uninterrupted social cover , she was not eligible , under any title , for a disability allowance under the new system . Instead of DATE covered by social security , the applicant had CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the applicant \u2019s disability pension request was refused both by the competent administrative authorities ( on DATE and CARDINAL DATE ) and by ORG , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As of DATE , the impugned legislative criteria have been amended with a view to extending the eligibility for disability allowance to those who have accumulated either CARDINAL days covered by social security in DATE or DATE in DATE . However , the applicant could not meet these criteria either .", "CARDINAL . It appears that currently the applicant lives on aid .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE ORG has examined a number of complaints attacking in essence the same new rules on disability entitlements ( decision FAC . DATE , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The complainants in those procedures raised their constitutional concerns after the final and binding domestic judgments , without applying to the ORG ) in review proceedings . Although these motions were eventually rejected as inadmissible for other reasons , ORG did not consider that , for their constitutional complaints to be entertained , those complainants were required to have approached the GPE beforehand ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
