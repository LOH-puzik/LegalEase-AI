The staging took place in a container where actors figured as asylum seekers in GPE who were successively voted out for expulsion by the public . This container action met severe criticism by the public , inter alia , by members of ORG ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL .

They are not ' spiritually depraved ' , they maintain .", "PERSON is suing PERSON . He is not alone , though : PERSON , PERSON and PERSON have all launched a powerful attack on PERSON PERSON with the assistance of the law firm PERSON .", "The reason is that the artist PERSON , a critic of the Government , wrote an ' open letter ' in the PERSON lavishing praise on the GPE city councillor for cultural affairs , PERSON ( \u00d6VP ) . Shortly before this , however , PERSON had allowed ORG 's provocative container to be installed outside the GPE ORG as a spectacle for the International Festival \u2013 despite bitter opposition from the PERSON GPE , a furious GPE ORG and the Minister of ORG , PERSON , who threatened prosecution .", "PERSON PERSON wrote in the PERSON at the time : ' It is not to be expected that the PERSON , ORG , PERSON , ORG , ORG , and whatever else these spiritually depraved political upstarts and their various beer - tent entertainers may be called , will have the slightest awareness of how embarrassing , dastardly and frequently absurd they are ' ( end of quotation ) . ORG will not stand for this humiliation . They have instructed LOC , with which the Minister of ORG severed ties in DATE , to file a peppery lawsuit against Mr PERSON .", "' Dastardly ' . In the private lawsuit it was stated that the allegations made in PERSON PERSON 's letter were ' untrue ' and that the ' unsubstantiated accusation ' that ORG were \u201c dastardly \u201d amounted to ' what would appear to be an absolutely classic case of defamation within the meaning of LAW .

As has happened in a number of similar cases , PERSON could be acquitted of defamation at first instance , since an artist really should have the right to express strong criticism . But at final instance Judge PERSON , known to be ORG - friendly , could come into the frame . PERSON was appointed to ORG board of governors by the ORG , and that creates at least an appearance of bias .", "Suspicion . Even the President of ORG , PERSON , is somewhat astonished at PERSON , especially as the lawyer persists in retaining ' PERSON ' in the law firm 's name : ' If a former partner of the current Minister of Justice is stressing how important it is for PERSON 's name to appear on the law firm 's notepaper , the uninformed observer will suspect there is something political behind it .

Mr Westenthaler , CARDINAL of the ORG politicians concerned , filed a request for forfeiture of the applicant company 's issue no . CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( PERSON ) , after having held a hearing , granted this request pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW and ordered the applicant company to pay the costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The court noted in its reasoning that the quoted passage consisted of value statements which insulted the plaintiff within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of LAW ) . The fact that the article merely quoted the impugned statements and had reported in a neutral manner about the criticism at issue was irrelevant for the proceedings under section CARDINAL of LAW . In the light of LAW , the court nevertheless expressed doubts as to the constitutionality of section CARDINAL of LAW as it did not provide for protection of a correct quotation of an incriminated passage at stake in pending defamation proceedings . Thus , in the court 's view , comprehensive reporting and criticism about pending defamation proceedings would be rendered practically impossible .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed , arguing that the forfeiture infringed its right to freedom of expression under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) upheld ORG decision in essence . The court first noted that the article showed by its appearance and structuring that it did not intend neutral reporting . The court referred in this regard to the repeated hints to PERSON PERSON , the allusions to the political motivations and misuse of the law - suits and the passage concerning the outcome of the defamation proceedings before ORG , which in particular expressed that an artist should have the right to sharp criticism . The court further noted that the passage at issue had to be assessed in the light of the article as a whole . In this regard , the court found that the reporting style used was typical for News , namely the use of special layout , highlighting certain words in bold or italics and adding pictures etc . , which aimed at influencing the reader unconsciously . The first part of the article , including the passage at issue , might still be regarded as objective reporting when being assessed isolated . Furthermore , however , the subtitle of the subsequent passage , namely the word \u201c dastardly \u201d written in bold , caught the reader 's eye and focused his mind in an unambiguous direction , incriminating the plaintiff . Even though the subsequent passage merely dealt with the contents of the law - suits , it conveyed to the reader that the plaintiff was in fact dastardly as some words were emphasised in italics and thereby attained independent significance . The court concluded that the article had not limited itself in objective citation . The first instance court had falsely classified the article as reporting on court proceedings as such reporting presumed the existence of court trials whereas in the present case there had only been a private prosecutors ' action . When balancing the interests involved , i.e. , the right to freedom of expression of the applicant company on the one hand , and the interest of the plaintiff not to be defamed , on the other , the court found in favour of the latter . It noted that even accepting that there was a public interest in the subject matter at issue , the allegation against the plaintiff , namely that he had a dastardly character without having provided any factual basis for this assertion , defamed him within the meaning of LAW and was worthless information for public debate . Therefore , it exceeded the limits of lawful criticism LAW CARDINAL of the Convention . Thus , the interference with the applicant company 's right to freedom of expression , namely the forfeiture of the above issue , was necessary and also proportionate to the aim pursued . This all the more as forfeiture concerned in general only older issues with no relation to the present actuality and with merely historical interest .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG did not share ORG concern as regards a possible unconstitutionality of CARDINAL of LAW . The court noted that , in any way , the criteria set up under LAW had to be considered when assessing whether or not a statement concerned established an offence within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL .
