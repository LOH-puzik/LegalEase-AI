On DATE the court decided to acquit the village guards . The court drew the following conclusions from the evidence :", "\u201c The statements which the witnesses and the complainants made when interrogated by the public prosecutor were different from those they later made before the court . In particular , in his statement before the public prosecutor , PERSON stated that the accused had covered their faces when they stopped the convoy , whereas in his statement to the court he did not specify whether or not the attackers had covered their faces . PERSON did not mention in his statement to the public prosecutor that it had been PERSON and PERSON who had attacked them , whereas he stated before the court that it had been the village guards ORG and PERSON who had attacked them . PERSON also stated before the public prosecutor that he did not know who had attacked them because their faces had been covered . However , in his statement before the court he said that PERSON \u2019s face had been completely uncovered , but that ORG \u2019s face had been covered . The witnesses PERSON , PERSON and PERSON gave no description of the identity of the attackers in their previous statements . Furthermore , those witnesses did not state whether or not the faces of the attackers had been covered . However , in their statements before the court , they gave a detailed account of the events and identified ORG and PERSON as the village guards who had opened fire on them .", "The village of PERSON was QUANTITY away from the village of ORG . It was highly probable that the inhabitants of the CARDINAL villages did not maintain close relations or contacts . It was therefore unlikely that the complainants could have identified the accused village guards as the attackers .", "Even assuming that the accused village guards PERSON and ORG were among the group of people who had attacked the complainants , there was no reasonable explanation as to why some of the village guards had covered their faces and some had not .", "In their statements the non - commissioned officers PERSON , PERSON and PERSON had said that they had kept guard together with the accused village guards from TIME on DATE to TIME on DATE . It appears from the non - commissioned ORG statements that the village guards returned to the gendarmerie command after they had completed their shift of duty . It further appears that the weapons belonging to the village guards had not been used during TIME when the incident had taken place . The non - commissioned officers confirmed that fact . Accordingly , it could not be concluded that the accused village guards had been involved in the killing of the villagers .", "In the ballistic report by ORG dated DATE , it was stated that CARDINAL cartridges had been found at the scene of the crime , CARDINAL of which had been fired from weapons belonging to the accused village guards . However , that evidence in itself is not sufficient to convict the village guards . First , it is still not known from whose weapon the remaining cartridges were fired . Secondly , it could not be determined by the laboratory whether or not the bullets removed from the bodies of PERSON and PERSON were fired from weapons belonging to the village guards .", "In their submissions the accused village guards stated that the empty cartridges found at the scene of the crime had been placed there by their enemies in order to implicate them in the crime . In fact , on DATE the village guards and the security forces had opened fire in order to stop a march that was being carried out by members of the terrorist organisation . Furthermore , in a clash between the security forces and members of the illegal organisation on CARDINAL DATE the security forces , as well as the village guards , had opened fire on the ORG members . In a report dated CARDINAL DATE , it was stated that CARDINAL bullets had been fired and CARDINAL empty cartridges had been recovered from the scene of the crime . It therefore appears that CARDINAL empty cartridges were not found . It is highly probable that empty cartridges from the incident of DATE were placed at the scene of the crime before or after the villagers were killed by unknown persons . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal with ORG against the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor at ORG submitted his opinion . He noted that the bullet in PERSON leg had not been removed . Moreover he noted that the court \u2019s decision to acquit the village guards was in contradiction with the findings in the ballistic report of DATE and the statements of CARDINAL witnesses who had recognized CARDINAL of the village guards and of ORG . The public prosecutor subsequently recommended the quashing of the decision of the first - instance court and the conviction of the CARDINAL accused village guards .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of the first - instance court in respect of CARDINAL of the accused village guards . Moreover , in the light of the findings in the ballistics reports dated DATE and DATE and the statements of ORG , ORG quashed the decision of the first - instance court in respect of CARDINAL of the accused . In its detailed decision the court further held that to try to remove the bullet in PERSON leg would have been too risky for the patient as was pointed out in LOC medical report .", "CARDINAL . The criminal proceedings were reopened before ORG against CARDINAL of the accused village guards . At the hearing of DATE the court decided to send letters rogatory to assize courts in CARDINAL different cities to obtain the statements of the accused and the interveners .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the accused village guards as charged and sentenced them to life imprisonment . The summary of the court \u2019s decision is as follows :", "\u201c In view of the autopsy reports , there is no question as to the cause of death of the CARDINAL villagers . Instead , the question to be resolved is whether those who fired on the villagers were the accused village guards .", "It is not possible to rely solely on the witness statements as they are contradictory on several points . However the witness statements given during the preliminary investigation seem to be , in general , objective . Relying on these initial statements it is established that the persons who had fired had their faces covered in order not to be recognised . The court is not convinced by the statements in which certain witnesses claimed to have recognised ORG and PERSON . Even assuming that ORG and PERSON were among those who had fired , there is no reasonable explanation for the fact that they had not covered their faces when everybody else had done so .", "Furthermore , in the court \u2019s opinion , what a commander would normally do when he had been notified of an incident would be to go to the scene of the incident as soon as possible . However in the present case , the fact that the non - commissioned officer PERSON checked all QUANTITY weapons CARDINAL by CARDINAL without taking any action is incomprehensible . Moreover the court notes that ORG maintained that the soldiers were not collecting the empty cartridges to help him and that he had personally to collect the empty cartridges which were near the dead bodies . In view of the above , the court concludes that PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were trying to defend the accused who were working with them to fight against terrorism and it does not therefore find their statements reliable .", "The court notes that the bullets removed from the bodies of PERSON and PERSON , can no longer be used for comparative tests to determine from which of the weapons they had been fired as the bullets in question have oxidised . Furthermore it is not possible to remove the bullet from PERSON body due to medical complications .", "Considering ORG statements where he said that there was a smell of gunpowder , the court comes to the conclusion that the allegation concerning the placing of empty cartridges at the scene of the incident , in order to implicate the village guards in the crime , is not corroborated in any persuasive manner by eyewitnesses or other evidence .", "Moreover the fact that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL cartridges were not fired from the village guards\u2019 weapons can not be taken as a proof of their innocence .
