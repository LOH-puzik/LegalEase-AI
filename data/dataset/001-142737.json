On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for theft .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of a number of offences including robbery with violence and threats , and was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , which was suspended except for the period of pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant was sentenced by ORG to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for involvement in a criminal organisation with a view to securing pecuniary advantage using intimidation , deception and corruption .", "CARDINAL . Having already spent time in pre - trial detention , he was subsequently detained in ORG and then in FAC , where he continued to serve his sentence until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE after their arrival , the applicant and his wife lodged an asylum application .", "CARDINAL . When interviewed in connection with her asylum claim , the applicant \u2019s wife stated that she had travelled through GPE .", "CARDINAL . A request to take back the applicant and his family was sent to the NORP authorities under LAW of DATE determining the ORG responsible for examining applications for asylum lodged in one of GPE of ORG ( \u201c FAC \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . After the NORP authorities refused the request , it transpired that the applicant and his family were in possession of a GPE visa issued by the NORP authorities . A request to take charge of them was therefore sent to the NORP authorities and was accepted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a further asylum application , using a false identity . It was immediately rejected after his fingerprints were checked .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer that the proceedings concerning the asylum application of DATE had been concluded on DATE with the refusal of the application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a first request for regularisation for DATE , on the basis of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( current section CARDINALbis ) of PERSON , Residence , Settlement and LAW of DATE ( \u201c the Aliens Act \u201d ) . In support of his request , the applicant stated that he and his wife had a daughter born in DATE and that his wife already had a daughter born in GPE from a previous relationship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the request devoid of purpose as the applicant had left the country and been intercepted in GPE . It found that the request was in any case unfounded in view of the fact that the applicant \u2019s medical treatment for tuberculosis had ended ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . ORG also referred to the applicant \u2019s lack of integration in GPE and the numerous breaches of public order he had committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a second request for regularisation of his residence status on the basis of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . He cited as exceptional circumstances in support of his request the duration of his residence in GPE and his integration into NORP society , the risks that a return to GPE would entail for his children \u2019s schooling , the fact that he had been the victim of persecution and his state of health .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the regularisation request on DATE on the ground that the evidence adduced did not amount to exceptional circumstances for the purposes of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW such as to warrant the lodging of the request in GPE rather than with the competent diplomatic mission or consulate , as was the rule . ORG noted that the applicant had been allowed to remain in the country for the sole purpose of the asylum proceedings , which had been concluded by a final decision . It also cited as reasons the lack of any need for medical treatment , the applicant \u2019s precarious and unlawful residence status , the absence of a risk of persecution in GPE and the possibility for the children to continue their schooling in that country .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the application to set aside ORG decision . ORG noted that since the decision in question had not been accompanied as such by an expulsion order , it could not give rise to a risk of violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , relying on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and alleging , in particular , that he would be unable to obtain treatment for his leukaemia ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) if he were deported to GPE , the applicant lodged a first request for regularisation on medical grounds on the basis of section CARDINALter of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the request on the ground that , under section CARDINAL/CARDINAL of the LAW , the applicant was excluded from its scope of application on account of the serious crimes which had given rise in the meantime to a ministerial deportation order issued on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request under the ordinary procedure for a stay of execution of that decision together with an application to set aside . He alleged in particular that ORG had referred exclusively to the ministerial deportation order in finding that section CARDINALter of LAW was not applicable in his case , without investigating his state of health or the risk he ran of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW , and without weighing up the interests at stake as required by LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims in the following terms :", "\u201c It is clear from the wording of [ section CARDINALter ] that there is nothing to prevent the administrative authority , when dealing with a request for leave to remain on the basis of the above - mentioned section CARDINALter , from ruling immediately on the exclusion of the person concerned from the scope of application of the said section CARDINALter without first taking a decision on the medical evidence submitted to it , if it considers at the outset that there are substantial grounds for believing that the person concerned has committed any of the acts referred to in section CARDINAL/CARDINAL , cited above . The examination of that evidence would be superfluous in such a situation since the person responsible for taking the decision has in any event already decided that section CARDINALter should not apply .", "...", "As regards the alleged violation of LAW , it should be observed that the decision complained of in the present application is not accompanied by any expulsion order , with the result that the alleged risk of discontinuation of treatment in the event of the applicant \u2019s deportation to GPE is hypothetical . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also dismissed the complaint under LAW in view of the fact that the impugned decision was not accompanied by any expulsion order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , relying on the same grounds as those invoked under section CARDINALter of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and on his family situation , the applicant lodged a request for regularisation on grounds of exceptional circumstances under section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the request for regularisation , taking the view that the protection of the ORG \u2019s best interests took precedence over the applicant \u2019s social and family interests and that by committing serious punishable acts the applicant himself had placed his family \u2019s unity in jeopardy . That decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request with ORG under the ordinary procedure for a stay of execution of the refusal decision of DATE , together with an application to have the decision set aside ( ORG case no . CARDINAL ) . In so far as necessary , the application also related to the order to leave the country issued on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The applicant alleged a violation of ORG and CARDINAL of the LAW and argued that his serious health problems amounted to exceptional humanitarian circumstances as defined by ORG in NORP v. GPE ( DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL ) , that he would not have access to treatment in GPE and that the withdrawal of treatment would lead to his premature death . He further alleged an infringement of LAW , on the ground that if he were deported to GPE he would be separated from his family permanently .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held on DATE . On DATE ORG ordered a fresh hearing to enable the parties to update the factual and legal evidence in the case . A hearing was scheduled for CARDINAL DATE but was cancelled on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the information in the case file these proceedings are still pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had lodged a second request for regularisation on medical grounds on the basis of section CARDINALter of LAW . In addition to his various medical problems he referred to the fact that he had been continuously resident in GPE for DATE and had lasting social ties in that country , and to his family situation . He also argued that if he was sent back he would be left to fend for himself while ill in a country in which he no longer had family ties and where the medical facilities were unsuitable and expensive .", "CARDINAL . The request was refused by ORG on DATE for the same reason it had cited previously ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG to have that decision set aside ( ORG case no . MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the information in the file those proceedings are currently pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the grounds that the NORP authorities did not have responsibility under LAW for examining the asylum application , ORG issued an order for the applicant and his wife to leave the country with a view to their transfer to GPE . However , their departure was postponed because the applicant \u2019s wife was pregnant .", "CARDINAL . After the birth , the family was granted leave to remain until DATE because the new - born baby was in hospital . Their leave to remain was subsequently extended until DATE on the ground that the child needed regular supervision by a paediatric gastroenterologist .", "CARDINAL . The time - limit for enforcement of the order to leave the country was extended several times during DATE because of the need to treat the applicant \u2019s tuberculosis ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) and the DATE course of anti - tubercular treatment required by the whole family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer that the time - limit had been extended until the applicant and his child had made a full recovery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a deportation order issued under LAW , the Minister of the ORG directed the applicant to leave the country and barred him from re - entering GPE for DATE . The order referred to the applicant \u2019s extensive criminal record , allied to the fact that \u201c the pecuniary nature of the offences PERSON ] the serious and ongoing risk of further breaches of public order \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The order became enforceable on the date of the applicant \u2019s release but was not in fact enforced because the applicant was undergoing medical treatment at the time ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who was in hospital , did not contact his lawyer in order to lodge an application to have the ministerial order set aside . However , on CARDINAL DATE the lawyer lodged an application on his own initiative .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the application as being out of time .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , as the applicant was about to finish serving the prison sentence imposed in DATE , he had been transferred on DATE to FAC with a view to enforcement of the ministerial deportation order . He remained there until DATE , when he was transferred to PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In parallel with its decision of DATE refusing the applicant \u2019s request for regularisation on grounds of exceptional circumstances ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG on DATE issued an order for him to leave the country , together with an order for his detention .

On DATE ORG issued an order to leave the country \u201c with immediate effect \u201d on the basis of the ministerial deportation order of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for an interim measure under LAW . Relying on ORG , CARDINAL and DATE of the LAW , he alleged that if he were expelled to GPE he would no longer have access to the health care he required and that , in view of his very short life expectancy , he would die within an even shorter period of time , far removed from his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG indicated to ORG that it was desirable , in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG , to suspend enforcement of the order for the applicant to leave the country issued on DATE \u201c pending the outcome of the proceedings before ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
