De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented by ORG , a firm of solicitors based in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP By application to the Chief Electoral Officer for GPE dated DATE , the applicant sought inclusion in the electoral register for GPE . The applicant was at the time of the application a serving prisoner , detained in FAC Maghaberry . The application was made in view of the pending elections to ORG , to be held on DATE . The deadline for registration in order to vote in the elections of CARDINAL DATE was DATE . At the date of this deadline the applicant was serving sentences of imprisonment totalling DATE imposed in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated CARDINAL DATE , the application was refused . The Chief Electoral Officer concluded that by virtue of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Representation of the People Act DATE ( as amended ) the applicant was legally incapable of voting as a result of his status as a convicted person currently detained ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , together with another serving prisoner , lodged an application for judicial review of the decision of the Chief Electoral Officer . He sought various forms of relief , including a declaration that the disqualification on convicted prisoners voting contained in sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act did not apply to the forthcoming or any future election to ORG ; a declaration that he was entitled to vote in the forthcoming and any future election to ORG ; damages for a breach of his rights under the Convention ; and a declaration that LAW Order CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was not compatible with LAW No . CARDINAL and should not be applied to the forthcoming or any future election to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the context of the judicial review proceedings , counsel for the ORG submitted that even if , in light of this ORG \u2019s judgment in ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIX , the Government pursued the option of permitting some prisoners to vote depending on the length of their sentence , they were unlikely to propose that prisoners serving sentences as long as the applicant \u2019s should become entitled to vote while detained . It was further pointed out that the applicant had failed to submit his application to be enrolled on the electoral register by the deadline for participation in the elections of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG of GPE dismissed the application for judicial review . PERSON considered that the judgment in ORG , cited above , gave a margin of appreciation to GPE in deciding how to ensure respect for the rights guaranteed by LAW No . CARDINAL . Accordingly , he concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL(iv ) . I consider that the [ GPE ] court has deliberately left the method of compliance in the hands of ORG subject to the overriding veto of the court ... Accordingly I see nothing intrinsically objectionable about the various options being explored by the Government proposals contained in the consultation paper of DATE which makes up its response to the ORG decision . The consequence of this is that not only is Mr PERSON [ Deputy Director , Rights and International Relations in ORG at ORG ] entitled to say ... that the Government is unlikely to propose that prisoners serving sentences as long as those of the applicants should become entitled to vote whilst detained , but I am left singularly unconvinced that the applicants are currently or will ever be able to lay claim to a right to vote . I reject the argument of Mr PERSON [ for the applicants ] that because a blanket prohibition on prisoners is incompatible with the Convention that somehow converts into the proposition that all prisoners are currently entitled to vote until the vacuum is filled . In my view that conforms neither with principle nor logic and certainly does not find any authority in ORG which expressly recognises that restraints on LAW are justifiable provided they pursue a legitimate aim and are proportionate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He added :", "\u201c Notwithstanding their knowledge since DATE that an election was to be in the near future , these proceedings were not launched until DATE at a time when the granting of the relief sought would have caused potentially the maximum confusion , disruption and waste of public money already incurred . This is particularly pertinent in the context of both applicants having failed even to apply to register to vote in time . These factors alone should extinguish any smouldering sense of injustice harboured by these applicants at this time . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released from prison on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL .
