FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 9;No violation of Art. 14+9", "JUDGES": "Luzius Wildhaber;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Kashrut is the name given to all the NORP laws on the types of food which may be eaten and how to prepare them . The main principles applying to kosher food are to be found in the NORP , the holy scripture comprising the first CARDINAL books of the Bible \u2013 the Pentateuch \u2013 namely PERSON , Exodus , GPE , ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the Creation only food from plants could be eaten by man ( Gen. i , CARDINAL ) . Eating meat was not authorised until after the Flood ( Gen. ix , CARDINAL ) and then only under very strict conditions . The NORP absolutely forbids the consumption of blood , since blood is the medium of life and life must not be absorbed with flesh but poured on the earth like water ( Deut . PERSON , DATE and DATE ) . In addition , certain animals are regarded as unclean and consumption of certain parts of animals is also forbidden .", "CARDINAL . Among quadrupeds , for example , only animals that are both cloven - hoofed and ruminants may be eaten ; that excludes solidungulates like horses and camels and non - ruminating quadrupeds like pigs and rabbits ( Lev . xi ; LOC . xiv ) . Among aquatic species , only fishes with both fins and scales may be eaten , but not crustaceans or shellfish . Among flying creatures , only non - carnivorous birds , such as grain - eating , farmyard fowls and some types of game may be eaten . Insects and reptiles are totally forbidden .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON ( PERSON . vii , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ; xvii , CARDINAL ) prohibits consumption of the blood of authorised mammals and birds , and slaughter must be carried out \u201c as the [ Lord has ] commanded \u201d ( Deut . PERSON , DATE ) . It is forbidden to eat meat from animals that have died of natural causes or have been killed by other animals ( Deut . xiv , CARDINAL ) . It is likewise forbidden to eat meat from an animal showing signs of disease or blemishes at the time of slaughter ( Num . xi , CARDINAL ) . Meat and other products of permitted animals ( such as milk , cream or butter ) must be eaten and prepared separately , in and with separate utensils , because the NORP prohibits the cooking of a kid in its mother 's milk ( ORG . xxii ; Deut . xiv , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . With a view to ensuring compliance with all the prohibitions laid down in the NORP , later commentators established very detailed rules concerning , in particular , the approved method of slaughter , initially by handing down the oral tradition but later by compiling an encyclopaedic collection of commentaries \u2013 the NORP .", "CARDINAL . DATE of the above rules on the eating of meat necessitates special slaughter processes . As it is forbidden for NORP to eat any blood whatsoever , animals for slaughter , after being blessed , must have their throats slit ; more precisely , they must be killed with a single stroke of a very sharp knife in such a way that an immediate , clean and deep cut is made through the trachea , the oesophagus , the carotid arteries and the jugular veins , so that the greatest possible quantity of blood will flow . The meat must then be steeped in water and salted , still with the aim of removing any trace of blood . Certain organs , like the liver , must be grilled to remove blood from them . Other parts , like the sciatic nerve , blood vessels or the fat around the vital organs , must be removed .", "CARDINAL . In addition , immediately after slaughter , the animal must be examined for any signs of disease or anomaly ; if there is the slightest doubt on that point , the meat is declared unfit for consumption . Ritual slaughter DATE shechitah \u2013 may be performed only by a shochet , who must be a devout man of unimpeachable moral integrity and scrupulous honesty . Lastly , until it comes to be sold , the meat must be kept under the supervision of a kashrut inspector . The competence and personal integrity of ritual slaughterers and kashrut inspectors are subject to continuous appraisal by a religious authority . In order to guarantee consumers that their meat has been slaughtered in accordance with the prescriptions of NORP law , the religious authority certifies it as \u201c kosher \u201d . Such certification gives rise to the levying of a tax known as slaughter tax or rabbinical tax .", "CARDINAL . NORP In GPE , as in many other NORP countries , the ritual slaughter required by NORP and NORP for religious reasons comes into conflict with the principle that an animal to be slaughtered , after being restrained , must first be stunned , that is plunged into a state of unconsciousness in which it is kept until death intervenes , in order to spare it any suffering . Ritual slaughter is nevertheless authorised under NORP law and by ORG and ORG of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant law and practice \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL . Ritual slaughter is regulated in NORP law by Decree no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , promulgated to implement LAW , as amended by Decree no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE . LAW provides :", "\u201c It is forbidden to perform ritual slaughter save in a slaughterhouse . Subject to the provisions of the fourth paragraph of this Article , ritual slaughter may be performed only by slaughterers authorised for the purpose by religious bodies which have been approved by ORG , on a proposal from the Minister of the ORG . ORG must be able to show documentary proof of such authorisation .", "The approved bodies mentioned in the previous paragraph must inform the Minister of Agriculture of the names of authorised persons and those from whom authorisation has been withdrawn . If no religious body has been approved , the prefect of the d\u00e9partement in which the slaughterhouse used for ritual slaughter is situated may grant individual authorisations . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the approval necessary for power to authorise slaughterers was granted to ORG alone . ORG is part of ORG ( \u201c the ACIP \u201d ) , which is an offshoot of LOC , the institution set up by PERSON I by means of LAW of DATE to administer NORP worship in GPE . Following the separation of the Churches and the ORG in DATE , the NORP congregations of GPE , numbering CARDINAL faithful , formed themselves into NORP liturgical associations ( see \u201c Relevant law and practice \u201d below ) under an umbrella organisation called ORG of GPE , which kept the name NORP .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW its statute , the aims of the Central Consistory are to serve the general interests of NORP worship , to safeguard the freedom needed to take part in it , to defend the rights of the congregations and to see to the founding , survival and development of joint institutions and services for the benefit of affiliated bodies . It also seeks to preserve the independence and dignity of the rabbinate , to ensure the permanence of the office of Chief Rabbi of GPE , to encourage recruitment of rabbis by organising ORG of GPE and to ensure , by general rules applicable to all the affiliated bodies , the preservation of unity , discipline and orderliness in the performance of acts of worship . It represents the general interests of NORP ORG and is dedicated to maintaining and preserving spiritual ties with GPE and NORP congregations throughout the world .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON includes congregations representing most of the main denominations within Judaism , with the exception of the liberals , who believe that the NORP should be interpreted in the light of DATE living conditions , and the ultra - orthodox , who advocate , on the contrary , a strict interpretation of the NORP .", "CARDINAL . ORG is composed of the Chief Rabbi of GPE , from the ORG , whose registered office is in FAC , GPE , the rabbi of the orthodox congregation of FAC , the rabbi of the NORP congregation of strict observance and the rabbi of the traditionalist congregation of FAC . It is empowered to issue the authorisations needed to obtain a card permitting access to the slaughterhouses . The rabbinical court , or PERSON , which rules on questions of religious law ( marriage , divorce and conversions ) , supervises observance of the dietary laws and appoints and monitors the kashrut slaughterers and inspectors employed by the PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act provides that the Republic may not recognise , pay stipends to or subsidise any religious denomination ( except in the CARDINAL d\u00e9partements of ORG , ORG and GPE , where ORG still applies ) , the income of all the liturgical associations in GPE , of whatever denomination , is derived from the contributions and gifts of their adherents . According to the Government , CARDINAL of the Central Consistory 's resources comes from the slaughter tax , which is levied at the rate of MONEY ( ORG ) per kilo of beef sold .", "CARDINAL . NORP The liturgical association Cha'are Shalom Ve Tsedek is an association declared on DATE with its registered office in FAC , GPE . According to its statute , the applicant association 's aims are \u201c to organise , subsidise , encourage , revive , assist , promote and finance , in GPE , public NORP worship and any other related or connected activities of a religious nature which might , directly or indirectly , lead towards the object it pursues \u201d . In addition , \u201c It will seek to co - ordinate the spiritual actions of other NORP liturgical associations , particularly those aimed at fostering observance of kashrut . It will assist with the promotion and creation of all social , educational , cultural and spiritual activities as far as its means permit and provide both moral and financial support to poor families belonging to the congregation or those experiencing temporary difficulties . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Cha'are Shalom Ve Tsedek association now has CARDINAL subscribing members and CARDINAL adherents , some of whom run a total of CARDINAL butcher 's shops , CARDINAL restaurants and CARDINAL caterers in the GPE region alone . In addition it has CARDINAL outlets for the sale of deep - frozen food in the GPE region , ORG and GPE .", "CARDINAL . The association publishes NORP calendars , has a PERSON ( study centre for young rabbis ) , CARDINAL centres for the study of the NORP and CARDINAL synagogues , in GPE and GPE . It is administered by a rabbinical committee which has sole jurisdiction over religious issues and is composed of chief rabbis , rabbis , well - known members of the congregation and kashrut slaughterers and inspectors .", "CARDINAL . Originally , the applicant association came into being as a minority movement which split away from the NORP of GPE . Its members are determined to practise their religion in the strictest orthodoxy . In particular , the applicant association wishes to perform ritual slaughter according to stricter rules than those followed by the slaughterers authorised by the GPE Central Consistory as regards examination of slaughtered animals for any signs of disease or anomalies .", "CARDINAL . The prescriptions concerning kosher meat , derived from GPE , were codified in a compendium called PERSON ( ORG ) written by Rabbi PERSON ( DATE ) , which lays down very strict rules . However , some later commentators accepted less constraining rules , particularly with regard to examination of the lungs of slaughtered animals . But a number of orthodox NORP , particularly those who belong to NORP congregations originally from GPE , including the members of the applicant association , wish to eat meat from animals slaughtered according to the most stringent requirements of the Shulchan Aruch . This type of meat is referred to by the NORP word \u201c glatt \u201d , meaning \u201c smooth \u201d .", "CARDINAL . For meat to qualify as \u201c glatt \u201d , the slaughtered animal must not have any impurity , or in other words any trace of a previous illness , especially in the lungs . In particular , there must be no filamentary adhesions between the pleura and the lung . This requirement of purity mainly concerns adult sheep and cattle , which are more likely to have contracted disease at some point of their existence . But , according to the applicant association , the ritual slaughterers under the authority of the Beth Din , the rabbinical court of the ORG , the only body to have been approved DATE on DATE by ORG , now no longer make a detailed examination of the lungs and are less exacting about purity and the presence of filaments so that , in the applicant association 's submission , butchers selling meat certified as kosher by the Central Consistory are selling meat which its members consider impure and therefore unfit for consumption .", "CARDINAL . The applicant association submitted that it was therefore obliged , in order to be able to make \u201c glatt \u201d kosher meat available to its adherents , to slaughter illegally and to obtain supplies from GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Government , for their part , produced a certificate from the Chief Rabbi of GPE to the effect that there were butcher 's shops supervised by the PERSON where the members of the Cha'are Shalom association could obtain \u201c glatt \u201d meat . In addition , according to figures supplied by the Government , the applicant association , which has QUANTITY employees , including CARDINAL ritual slaughterers , had a turnover of ORG CARDINAL in DATE , despite refusal of authorisation to perform ritual slaughter , and more than ORG CARDINAL of this sum came from slaughter tax . In DATE the turnover was ORG , of which ORG came from the slaughter tax , and in DATE the income from the slaughter tax came to more than FRF CARDINAL . The tax levied by the applicant association for slaughter amounted to ORG CARDINAL for QUANTITY of kosher meat sold .", "CARDINAL . DATE , when it was registered only as a cultural ( rather than liturgical ) association , the applicant association certified as being \u201c glatt \u201d kosher the meat sold in the butcher 's shops of its members . This meat was either imported from GPE or came from animals slaughtered in GPE in accordance with its own religious prescriptions , and therefore without certification from the GPE PERSON . Civil proceedings were brought against it by the ORG , which alleged that it had given a misleading description of goods offered for sale , since it had fraudulently labelled the meat sold as kosher .", "However , the ORG 's action was dismissed by ORG in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , later upheld by ORG , on the ground that LAW on the separation of the Churches and the State did not allow the courts to rule on the question whether a liturgical association like the applicant was empowered to guarantee that meat offered for sale was kosher ; on the other hand , ORG noted that it had not been contested that the applicant association had complied with the strict rules concerning ritual slaughter and inspection .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant association asked the Minister of the ORG to propose its approval with a view to practising ritual slaughter . This application was refused by a decision of CARDINAL DATE on the grounds that the association was not sufficiently representative within the NORP community and was not a religious association within the meaning of Part PERSON of the LAW of DATE on the separation of the ORG and the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant association appealed to ORG , pleading an infringement of freedom of religion , guaranteed both by CARDINAL of the LAW of DATE on the separation of the ORG and the ORG and by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the association 's appeal , giving the following reasons :", "\u201c ...", "The grounds given for the impugned decision were that the association was not sufficiently representative within the NORP community and that it was not a liturgical association within the meaning of Part IV of the LAW of DATE . In making that decision the Minister of the ORG refused to accept that the association was a religious body coming within the scope of the above - mentioned provisions .", "Although LAW appellant 's statute describes it as a liturgical association governed by the provisions of LAW of DATE , ... [ the applicant association ] has not established , as the evidence stands at present , that it subsidises or that it is an offshoot of an association which subsidises the continuation of and public participation in NORP worship . The fact that it makes kosher meat available for sale in CARDINAL retail butcher 's and CARDINAL outlets for the sale of deep - frozen food is not sufficient to give the association the character of a religious body which may be proposed by the Minister of the Interior for approval by the Minister of Agriculture ... The Minister of the ORG was thus able to take the impugned decision without committing any error as to the facts or the law or any manifest error of assessment , nor did he infringe the freedom of worship , since he did no more than verify the status of the appellant organisation in the interests of public policy and pursuant to the provisions referred to above .", "Lastly , it has not been established that the Minister 's decision was taken on grounds that had nothing to do with public policy requirements and was prompted by a desire to reserve the benefit of approval for the only NORP religious body which has obtained it ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant association appealed against this judgment to the ORG d'Etat . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG d'Etat dismissed the appeal on the following grounds :", "\u201c ...", "... The documents in the file do not establish that the NORP liturgical association Cha'are Shalom Ve Tsedek , which does not organise any worship or dispense any teaching , has on account of its activities the character of a ' religious body ' for the purposes of LAW of DATE . Consequently , by refusing to propose it for approval by ORG , the Minister of the Interior did not commit any error of law and gave sufficient grounds for his decision .", "[ Lastly , ] in taking the impugned decision the Minister of the ORG only used the powers conferred on him by the above - mentioned provisions with a view to ensuring that ritual slaughter is performed in conditions consistent with public policy requirements , public hygiene and respect for public freedoms . Accordingly , the appellant association may not validly maintain that the Minister interfered in the functioning of a religious body or that he infringed the freedom of religion guaranteed in particular by the Declaration of the Rights of Man and LAW [ on ] Human Rights ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Concurrently with its application of CARDINAL DATE for approval as a religious body , the applicant association submitted on DATE to the prefect of the d\u00e9partement of ORG an application on behalf of CARDINAL ritual slaughterers who were members of the association , and were authorised by it , for specific individual authorisations to perform ritual slaughter in an establishment in that d\u00e9partement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prefect refused this application on the grounds that LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE empowered prefects to authorise individual slaughterers only where no religious body had been approved for the religion in question and that it was clear that ORG had been given the approval concerned .", "CARDINAL . The applicant association appealed against this decision to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal against the prefect 's decision on the following grounds :", "\u201c ...", "The evidence placed before the ORG shows , and this has not been contested , that by a decision of DATE the Minister of Agriculture , acting on the basis of LAW of the above - mentioned decree of DATE , approved the ' ORG as a body empowered to appoint ritual slaughterers authorised to perform ritual slaughter in the manner prescribed by the NORP religion . That approval prevents prefects from issuing individual authorisations under LAW permitting persons or institutions adhering to the religion concerned to perform ritual slaughter . It is clear , particularly in the light of LAW , that the cultural association ' Cha'are Shalom Ve Tsedek ' proclaims its adherence to the NORP religion . Consequently , and even though the association apparently refuses for religious reasons to recognise the authority of ORG , the individual application it made for a derogation authorising it to perform ritual slaughter in a slaughterhouse in the d\u00e9partement of ORG could only be refused . Accordingly , when the prefect of ORG , in refusing the application on DATE , applied these legal rules , as he was required to do , without becoming involved in the internal dissensions of the NORP religion , he did not infringe the principle of equality in the application of administrative rules or the principle of freedom of worship set forth in LAW of DATE on the separation of the ORG and the ORG or the freedom of conscience and religion enunciated ... in LAW for the protection of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG d'Etat upheld the above judgment on appeal , giving the following reasons :", "\u201c The provisions ... of the third paragraph of LAW of DATE give prefects the power to authorise ritual slaughterers only where no religious body has been approved for the religion concerned under the first paragraph of the same Article . It is clear that ORG has obtained the approval in question .
