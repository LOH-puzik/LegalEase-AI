On DATE ( on DATE ) , the documents enclosed by the applicant with his application for a warrant of execution were returned to him .

The appeal was consequently forwarded to ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ruling of DATE was quashed by ORG of GPE . ORG disagreed with the lower court \u2019s interpretation of LAW . Furthermore , ORG noted that the first - instance court was not in a position to conclude whether ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE did not require enforcement , as the materials of the case did not contain a \u201c certified copy of that decision \u201d . The case was remitted to ORG for fresh examination . On DATE the case file was forwarded from ORG to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON brought court proceedings before a NORP court seeking to obtain a residence order in respect of the child .", "CARDINAL .

Street .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE a judge of ORG examined the case file and issued procedural rulings ordering additional evidence to be gathered . In particular , the judge decided to call ORG for a preliminary discussion concerning the case on DATE . On that date the judge set the case for an open hearing and ordered that the parties be notified .", "CARDINAL . The judge also invited the applicant to resubmit the package of documents he had previously submitted together with his first application of CARDINAL DATE ( letter of CARDINAL DATE , no . CARDINALM-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The judge indicated that those documents should reach ORG before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE received from ORG of GPE a renewed application for a warrant of execution together with supporting documents . A cover letter by ORG of GPE referred to the provisions of LAW and was very similar to the first letter sent on DATE . The request contained CARDINAL pages of enclosures , consisting of court decisions by the NORP courts in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the request by ORG was forwarded by the federal ORG to its GPE branch .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE branch of ORG received the application and on DATE forwarded it with the enclosed documents to ORG . In a cover letter addressed to the President of ORG , ORG asked to be kept informed about the developments in the applicant \u2019s case . According to the Government , application and the enclosed documents were only received by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following the remittal of the case from ORG of GPE , re - examined the first application . PERSON was present at the hearing . She argued that the original judgment of DATE had been unlawful , as the GPE court had been incompetent to examine the dispute . She insisted that the applicant and the GPE courts had been perfectly aware of her moving to GPE with the child on DATE . She also argued that the NORP courts should not have examined the case , as only the courts of the country where the child and his resident parent or lawful guardian had established de facto residence were competent to hear such a case . According to PERSON , the NORP courts had based their jurisdiction on the \u201c registration \u201d ( propiska ) status of the child , whereas his de facto residence was in GPE , together with his mother . PERSON also argued that she was working and was capable of taking proper care of her son in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the arguments made by ORG It ruled that the child ( PERSON ) was residing in GPE on a temporary basis , as confirmed by the temporary registration certificates , and that his permanent place of residence was in GPE . Consequently , the GPE court had been competent , under LAW and the bilateral treaty of DATE , to examine the matter .", "CARDINAL . Further , ORG held that none of the reasons preventing enforcement of a foreign judicial decision stated in Article CARDINAL of ORG existed in the case at hand . The alleged \u201c unlawfulness \u201d of the judgment of ORG under LAW and LAW did not prevent the NORP courts from issuing a warrant of execution .", "CARDINAL . As a result , the GPE court granted the application and ordered the enforcement of the judgment of DATE on the territory of GPE . It stipulated that that judgment had ordered that the child reside , for the purposes of his upbringing and education , with his father .", "CARDINAL . Ms E.P. appealed . In her statement of appeal she developed the arguments she had put forward before ORG . In particular , she referred to the provisions of NORP law on the legal status of foreigners which defined a foreigner \u2019s place of \u201c permanent residence \u201d as the place where the foreigner lives permanently and lawfully for a significant amount of time . She also maintained that the enforcement of ORG judgment would be contrary to the best interests of the child , as set forth in the DATE LAW . In particular , she argued that the child did not remember the applicant and considered her new husband , Mr ORG , to be his father , and that returning him to the care of his biological father would endanger his psychological well - being and development . PERSON claimed that the decision of ORG had ignored her son \u2019s best interests : in particular , she referred to the decision of ORG in the case of PERSON , where the NORP courts had refused to enforce a decision of an NORP court , finding that the children involved were living permanently on the territory of GPE and therefore only the NORP courts were competent to decide , on the basis of NORP law , the child residence dispute between the parents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a written memorandum in reply to the statement of appeal by PERSON The applicant contested her argument concerning the alleged lack of jurisdiction of the NORP courts in the child residence proceedings . He further insisted that PERSON conduct had been immoral and harmful for the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote a letter to the applicant explaining that on DATE it had received a package of documents from the applicant . It appears that this was the same package which the applicant had previously submitted together with his first application for a warrant of execution ( that of CARDINAL DATE ) , which had later been returned to him by ORG on DATE , and which ORG had requested from him again on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE examined PERSON appeal . The hearing took place in presence of ORG ; the applicant was absent from the hearing . She repeated her argument concerning the distinction between \u201c registration \u201d and \u201c residence \u201d , insisted that the NORP courts had misinterpreted the relevant provisions of LAW , and asserted that they had lacked jurisdiction to hear the case . ORG also referred to the provisions of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , which provided that a foreign judgment should not be executed on the territory of GPE if it could harm the sovereignty or security of GPE or if it was contrary to public policy . PERSON claimed that separating a small child from his mother would be contrary to the public policy of GPE .", "CARDINAL . Following the hearing ORG quashed ORG judgment of DATE . ORG found that the applicant had failed to follow the procedure established by ORG . In particular , he had not submitted the following documents to the NORP courts : a certified copy of ORG judgment , a letter from ORG asking for the enforcement of the judgment on the territory of GPE , a statement by the judge that the judgment had not yet been enforced in GPE , a confirmation by the same judge that ORG and her representative had been duly notified of the date and place of the hearing before ORG , and , finally , a statement by ORG that the judgment had entered into force . ORG also noted that the translations into NORP of the court documents submitted by the applicant had not been made . In such circumstances , ORG should not have granted his application for a warrant of execution \u2013 instead , under LAW was obliged to adjourn the proceedings and give the applicant the opportunity to submit the missing documents . ORG ordered that the case be remitted for fresh consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was received by a judge of ORG . The judge ordered that PERSON be summoned and that she provide details of the address she had stated when obtaining temporary registration in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge set CARDINAL DATE as the date of the hearing of the case and ordered that PERSON second husband , PERSON ORG , be summoned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON left her second husband , Mr ORG , and took the child with her . Mr ORG stated ( see below ) that he was aware that she had moved in with a new partner , but he did not know his name or where they were living .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a police officer from the ORG visited Mr ORG and inquired about the whereabouts of GPE On DATE a municipal council worker visited Mr ORG and asked him the same question , but Mr PERSON was unable to give any specific information in response . It appears that by that time relations between Mr PERSON and ORG had seriously deteriorated and Mr PERSON was considering starting divorce proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a motion for interim measures with ORG . He informed the court that PERSON and PERSON ORG had split up , that she had taken the child with her , and that their whereabouts were unknown . He also alleged that her new partner was potentially violent and that he had previously threatened to beat up Mr ORG The applicant claimed that in order to protect the child from the unpredictable behaviour of his mother and her new partner interim measures were needed . First , the applicant asked the court to obtain from the police details of the new address where PERSON was living with the child . Second , the applicant sought an order prohibiting PERSON from leaving GPE and GPE without the applicant \u2019s written consent . Third , the applicant asked the court to make a temporary residence order in respect of the child in his favour , pending the conclusion of the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE police informed the applicant that the whereabouts of PERSON and her son were unknown , and that a \u201c search file \u201d was open in respect of a minor , PERSON , in the competent department of the police department for ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr ORG wrote a letter to ORG in which he supported the applicant \u2019s claims . In particular , he insisted that ORG had manipulated him , and that by moving in with her new partner she had deprived the child of his adoptive father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s motion applying for interim measures and dismissed it . ORG held that the interim measures sought by the applicant ( a prohibition on ORG leaving GPE and the grant of a temporary residence order in respect of the child ) amounted , in essence , to CARDINAL separate claims , which went beyond the scope of the enforcement proceedings initiated by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing , in the presence of PERSON and Mr PERSON as a witness . ORG heard both of them ; in particular , PERSON and Mr PERSON both related the story of their separation . Mr ORG \u2019s testimony was generally consonant with the position of the applicant ; PERSON denied the allegations of improper behaviour and blamed Mr PERSON for their separation . PERSON also informed the court of her current actual address and place of formal registration ( both were in GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( CARDINAL DATE ) ORG decided to grant the applicant \u2019s application for enforcement of the judgment of ORG making a residence order in respect of the child . ORG found that the applicant had submitted all necessary documents concerning the original judgments of the NORP courts , the proper notification of the defendant and the final character of those judgments . ORG further established that none of the reasons preventing the execution of the foreign judgment stated by LAW ORG or LAW were present in the case . In particular , ORG dismissed the argument by ORG that the enforcement of the decision of ORG in GPE would be contrary to \u201c public policy \u201d . ORG noted that the concept of \u201c public policy \u201d was different from the notion of \u201c national legislation \u201d , and that it referred to the most basic rules by which society functions in economic and social terms and the foundations of the legal order established in LAW .", "CARDINAL . Next , ORG repeated its earlier argument that the mother and child \u2019s \u201c permanent place of residence \u201d was to be determined on the basis of their place of registration , which was in GPE . In GPE , ORG had temporary resident status and had changed her address several times . Furthermore , the child residence proceedings had been started by the applicant before PERSON had moved from GPE to GPE . ORG concluded that the NORP courts had had jurisdiction in the child residence proceedings . As a result , ORG issued an execution warrant ( no . DATE ) ordering the enforcement of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . It appears that this judgment was not appealed against and thus entered into force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE execution warrant no . DATE was sent , by registered post , to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the execution warrant issued by ORG ( No . DATE ) was received by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the warrant was sent back to ORG without execution . The bailiff to whom the warrant was entrusted decided that ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE was \u201c not subject to enforcement \u201d . As is evident from a letter from ORG DATE , ORG did not forward a copy of its decision not to institute enforcement proceedings to the applicant .", "DATE . Having become aware of the decision , on an unspecified date the applicant asked ORG to review the case file they held concerning his case . However , those materials were allegedly destroyed during a fire that took place on CARDINAL DATE at the PERSON branch of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime the applicant learned , through his own enquiries , that PERSON was living with another man , PERSON , at an address on PERSON . Street . However , on DATE ORG informed the applicant that PERSON and GPE were not living at the address on ORG . Street . According to the owner of the flat , the mother and the child had rented a room in that flat for DATE but had then left without leaving any forwarding address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote a letter to ORG explaining the reasons for the nonenforcement of execution warrant no . DATE . According to the letter , \u201c the judicial act [ of the NORP courts ] simply acknowledged the fact that the child was living with his father and , by its [ very ] nature , did not require enforcement action [ to be taken ] , since the court ... did not establish an obligation on the respondent to perform certain actions or refrain from performing them . Similarly , the judicial act did not contain an order for removal of the child from the respondent \u2019s [ care ] and his return to the plaintiff \u201d . The ORG recommended that the applicant file a new claim with the courts in GPE in order to obtain an order specifically stating that such actions take place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint with ORG of GPE of inaction on the part of ORG , seeking an injunction .", "CARDINAL . The District Court summoned PERSON , the applicant and the bailiff who had issued the impugned decision . The first hearing was held on DATE , but all of the parties summoned failed to appear , so the court adjourned the hearing to DATE .", "CARDINAL . The hearing of DATE took place in presence of PERSON and a representative of ORG . However , due to the failure of the applicant to appear , the case was adjourned to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the court that he agreed to the examination of the case in his absence .", "CARDINAL . The new hearing took place on DATE . None of the parties were present , but the court decided to proceed with the examination of the case on the basis of the case file . ORG granted the applicant \u2019s claim that DATE . It found that the execution warrant issued by ORG , based on ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , was valid and enforceable on the territory of GPE . It further held that the decision of the bailiff not to start enforcement proceedings in this respect was unlawful . On DATE ORG upheld the decision on appeal .", "DATE . According to the Government , the bailiff concerned was not subjected to disciplinary action for his failure to enforce the execution warrant due to his dismissal from the civil service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote a letter to the NORP police , asking them to inform him of the whereabouts of his son and PERSON As per the reply of ORG of DATE , ORG was living with her son on PERSON . Street in GPE , while being formally registered at another address in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was detained by the NORP police and questioned in relation to her immigration status . According to the authorities , her resident permit had expired on DATE . Ms ORG confirmed that her residence permit had expired but explained that she was in the process of regularising her status . Her case was submitted to a judge , who decided to give her an administrative fine of MONEY .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE the GPE authorities instituted criminal proceedings again PERSON for illegal crossing of the border .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON and the applicant \u2019s son left GPE and crossed the GPE - GPE border through the PERSON checkpoint . Sometime later they arrived , via GPE , in GPE . According to the respondent Government , the applicant was notified of this in DATE at the latest .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE , PERSON met the applicant and handed their son over to him . Consequently , ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE was finally executed . In a letter to ORG the applicant confirmed that information .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant made numerous attempts to initiate criminal proceedings against PERSON in GPE . His letters to the NORP prosecuting authorities led to numerous inquiries which concerned allegations of violence in respect of GPE , the immigration status of ORG and so forth . However , all of those inquiries were terminated , the investigative authorities having concluded that there was no case to answer .", "CARDINAL . Thus , on DATE ORG refused to extradite PERSON to GPE in connection with criminal proceedings which had been opened against her there . On several occasions the NORP police refused to institute criminal proceedings against PERSON in GPE ( decisions of CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE , and CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also called on the NORP child welfare authorities at different levels \u2013 municipal , city and federal \u2013 to act on a number of occasions . According to the ORG , the competent officials repeatedly tried to establish the whereabouts of PERSON and the child , and inspect their living conditions . An inspection of CARDINAL DATE assessed ORG home environment and living conditions . On DATE PERSON was personally examined by a child welfare board at his kindergarten ; the board concluded that ORG was not a victim of violence at home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at the request of the applicant , rendered a new judgment whereby it ordered PERSON to return the child , PERSON , to the applicant . That judgment came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant brought proceedings against the NORP Federation seeking compensation for ORG failure to enforce the warrant of execution of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE ORG returned this claim without examination . ORG held that PERSON no . CARDINAL-FZ of DATE did not give rise to liability on the part of the ORG for non - enforcement of judgments when the obligation on the defendant consisted of the return of a child to the custody of another parent . On DATE ORG , sitting as a court of appeal , upheld that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that a duplicate of execution warrant no . DATE be issued . ORG found that the original execution warrant had been destroyed in the fire at ORG premises on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a duplicate warrant of execution in respect of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE ORG opened enforcement proceedings on the basis of that warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened enforcement proceedings on the basis of the duplicate of warrant no . CARDINAL ( i.e. the warrant issued on CARDINAL DATE ) .
