The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They are brother and sister . Their respective children , PERSON and PERSON , aged DATE and CARDINAL respectively , were killed by soldiers on DATE in south - east GPE . During the same incident the soldiers also killed CARDINAL other young people , aged DATE , DATE and DATE ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . The bodies of those CARDINAL individuals were subsequently handed over to their families , who buried them in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor ordered the release of the bodies of the applicants\u2019 CARDINAL children . The applicants took the bodies from the morgue in order to take them to the city of PERSON , where they wanted to bury them and where their graves had already been prepared with the help of the municipal officials .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the governor of PERSON issued a decision stating that crowds had gathered at the cemetery in PERSON and had attacked the municipal workers who were preparing the graves . Subsequently , the incidents at the cemetery had escalated and turned into \u201c unlawful demonstrations \u201d . Therefore , \u201c in order to prevent any unwanted consequences \u201d , the governor decided to order the burial of the applicants\u2019 children in the CARDINAL villages named in the respective birth register records of the CARDINAL deceased .", "CARDINAL . While the applicants , together with the coffins of their CARDINAL children , were on their way to PERSON , their vehicles were stopped by gendarme soldiers who told the applicants that they were not allowed to bury their children in PERSON . The soldiers told the applicants that , in accordance with the decision taken by the PERSON governor , the bodies would be buried in CARDINAL other villages . The applicants told the soldiers that they had no connection with the CARDINAL villages in question which , in any event , had been evacuated by soldiers in DATE . They stated that they wanted to bury their children side by side in their family cemetery in PERSON . Despite their objections , the bodies of the CARDINAL children were confiscated and taken away by the soldiers .", "CARDINAL . DATE the second applicant made an official request to the office of the governor and asked for permission to bury the children in the city of Batman instead . This request was refused but the governor amended his decision so that the applicants\u2019 children could be buried in the same cemetery in the town of ORG , instead of being buried in CARDINAL separate villages as he had previously ordered . In accordance with that decision , the applicants\u2019 children were buried by the authorities in the municipal cemetery in PERSON at TIME on DATE without any religious ceremony .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought a case before ORG and asked for the PERSON governor \u2019s decision to be annulled . They also requested that the ORG issue an interim measure allowing them to exhume the bodies before they decomposed , and to bury them in a cemetery of their choice . The applicants agreed , in particular , that it was important and necessary to maintain public order . However , they argued that the governor \u2019s decision had completely disregarded the moral values of their society and had aroused anger . The news that their children would not be buried in PERSON and that their bodies had been confiscated by the soldiers had caused an upsurge of emotion in the people waiting at the cemetery in PERSON and as a result they had attacked members of the security forces and local shops with sticks and stones . When the security forces responded to those attacks heavy handedly , scores of people had been injured and CARDINAL people had been arrested . All of that unrest had been caused by the governor \u2019s unlawful decision . No such incidents had taken place during the burial of the CARDINAL other individuals who had been killed at the same time as their children . In their complaint the applicants also referred to their rights under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the case . It noted that the governor \u2019s decision had been based on section CARDINAL/C of the PERSON on ORG , which provided that the governor had a duty to maintain peace and public order in the province under his responsibility . The decision had been taken because the people who had gathered at the cemetery in PERSON and who were waiting for the bodies to arrive had thrown stones at municipal workers and members of the security forces . The decision to bury the bodies in the town of ORG had therefore been taken with a view to maintaining public order . ORG considered that , although the applicants had the right to bury their children in a cemetery of their choice , the refusal to permit them to do so had been in compliance with the restrictions set out in the second paragraphs of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and in LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the decision and maintained that the incidents at the cemetery referred to by ORG had only occurred after the crowds had found out about the authorities\u2019 refusal to allow them to bury their children in PERSON . They repeated their argument that the CARDINAL others killed by the soldiers at the same time as their children had been buried by their families in ORG without incident . The applicants also reiterated their request for an interim measure .", "CARDINAL . The request for an interim measure was rejected by ORG on DATE . In a decision of CARDINAL October CARDINAL ORG also rejected the appeal lodged by the applicants against the decision of ORG . In reaching its conclusion ORG stated that the incidents at FAC had begun when the people who had gathered there had insisted that the applicants\u2019 CARDINAL children be buried next to the graves of members of the ORG .", "CARDINAL .
