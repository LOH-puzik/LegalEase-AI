NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr A. Pagliano , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG ( GPE di Informazione Finanziaria , hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the national authority responsible for combatting money laundering , ordered the temporary freezing of bank accounts ( mentioned below at paragraph CARDINAL ) at CARDINAL named NORP banks , which were traced back to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the relevant law , the ORG informed the investigating judge ( PERSON della PERSON ) of the freezing order and provided him with all the information in its possession . A criminal investigation was thus opened against the applicant and CARDINAL others for the continuous offence of money laundering under LAW and CARDINAL bis of LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE , the investigating judge , relying on LAW bis and ter of LAW ( see relevant domestic law below ) preventively seized , inter alia , the following assets , which were all traced back to the applicant : ( i ) bank account No . CARDINAL ; ( ii ) bank account No . DATE ; ( iii ) securities portfolio ( dossier titoli amministrati ) No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; ( iv ) bank account No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; ( v ) the financial product ( prodotto finanziario ) No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; and ( vi ) the insurance product ( prodotto assicurativo ) No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL . The judge also ordered the seizure of any credit balance or other assets ( including any safe deposit boxes ) traced back to the accused persons . A judicial notice was issued on DATE by the investigating judge and served on the applicant \u2019s legal counsel .", "CARDINAL . According to the prosecution , the accused persons had DATE laundered assets which were the product of fraudulent bankruptcy committed by a certain PERSON ( CARDINAL of the co - accused ) to the detriment of various NORP companies ( company ORG , company ORG and others ) , which had been traced back to PERSON and of which he had been the director and liquidator . Other laundered assets were the product of other offences ( such as embezzlement , fraud and tax fraud ) , also committed by PERSON The laundering had been carried out in CARDINAL different episodes ( all set out precisely in the judicial notice ) and the applicant had taken part in CARDINAL of them . In particular , the accused persons had carried out several bank operations , consisting , inter alia , of repeated withdrawals and deposits of money , the issuing and cashing of cheques on behalf of fictitious persons or the other co - accused persons and the use of bank accounts ( sometimes held by other co - accused persons , by relatives or foreign companies ) to transfer money within the country or abroad for the purposes of concealing its criminal origin .", "CARDINAL . Except for the assets related to the alleged fraudulent bankruptcy by PERSON , the alleged criminal origin of the other assets was indicated in the seizure decision by means of references to the legal classification of some of the offences allegedly committed by PERSON The second page of the decision specified offences such as \u201c bankruptcies , embezzlement , fraud and tax fraud \u201d , while page CARDINAL gave more generic indications such as \u201c acts of fraud and tax offences \u201d . The decision gave no further details regarding the factual basis for such predicate offences .", "CARDINAL . In the detailed seizure decision , the investigating judge reconstructed in precise terms all the above - mentioned bank operations and expressly referred , inter alia , to the applicant \u2019s financial situation . He noted that a customer due diligence test carried out on DATE by one of the banks involved had shown that the applicant did not have any administrative role or shareholdings in any NORP companies which could produce any income . According to the judge , after that period , from DATE , the applicant had been a partner and advisor in a named management consultancy firm . He had not carried out any other business or professional activities and was not on the list of professionals who had received legitimate payments from the bankrupt companies , P. and C. In the light of that information , the judge considered that the applicant \u2019s financial resources were not consistent with the financial , business or professional activities he had declared he carried out .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the investigating judge considered that there had existed a periculum in PERSON ( danger in delay ) in not issuing a seizure order , as the consequences of the offence could have been aggravated or prolonged . Indeed , the assets could have been withdrawn and/or concealed by the accused persons , thus frustrating the possibility for confiscation at the end of the proceedings . Moreover , the laundering was allegedly still ongoing at the time of the ORG \u2019s temporary freezing order . By the same decision the judge also summoned the applicant for questioning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and CARDINAL other accused persons represented by the same counsel lodged a complaint against the seizure decision with the Judge of ORG ( GPE d\u2019Appello GPE ) under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant primarily requested the lifting of the decision in toto or alternatively a reduction in the amount of money seized to MONEY ( ORG ) . The grounds he gave included the fact that : ( i ) the judge had violated the principle of nullum crimen sine lege since he had applied a wording of LAW bis and ter of LAW which had been introduced only in DATE and had therefore not yet been in force at the material time . According to the applicant , prior to the amendments introduced by LAW . CARDINAL of DATE , the domestic law had not provided for a precautionary seizure with the aim of the future confiscation of items other than the price , product or profit of a crime or which had been used to commit a crime \u2013 the seizure had therefore been disproportionate ; ( ii ) the alleged offences at the origin of the laundered money had been indicated by the investigating judge in a very generic way DATE he argued that such a lack of specifics was not sufficient to provide CARDINAL of the prerequisites for the seizure , namely the fumus delicti ( the presumption of a sufficient legal basis ) ; ( iii ) the only predicate offence which had been mentioned in sufficiently precise terms in the seizure decision had been that of fraudulent bankruptcy to the detriment of company P. , for which PERSON had been found guilty , at first - instance , in NORP criminal proceedings . However , in that connection and in relation to his alternative request , the applicant noted that the NORP court , in GPE , had found that PERSON had taken LAW from the assets of company P. ( which had then gone bankrupt ) and that only a part of that money ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) had then been transferred to GPE . Thus , there was a disproportion between the money seized ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) and the money having an ascertained ( or at least a precisely indicated ) criminal origin ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The applicant argued that the judge had failed even to give a summary description of the alleged actions or factual background constituting such offences and that such lacunas had made it impossible for him to adequately defend himself .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , served on the applicant on CARDINAL DATE , the Judge of ORG rejected his requests .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the judge held that there had been no violation of the principle of nullum crimen sine lege since that rule was applicable only to substantive criminal provisions not procedural ones . The latter were subject , instead , to the tempus regit actum principle ( the legality of an act can only be judged according to the law in effect at the time of the act ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the judge , preventive seizure ( either probative or preventive with the aim of eventual permanent confiscation ) could be ordered regardless of a final finding of guilt concerning an offence . Such a measure was aimed at preventing the commission of further offences or making sure that future measures were not frustrated . Moreover , contrary to the opinion of the defence , preventive seizure had been applicable at the material time ( before the amendment of DATE ) as section CARDINAL of Law No . CARDINAL of DATE had expressly provided for it .", "CARDINAL . As to the difference between the sums seized and the alleged product of the offence , the court stated that Articles CARDINAL bis and ter of LAW did not set any limits on seizures or state that the seized amount had to be limited to funds belonging to the accused , or to the price , product , or profit of an offence . According to the judge , a proportionality test had to be carried out only at the stage of applying permanent confiscation following a finding of guilt , not at the stage of precautionary measures , given the different purpose of the measures .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the alleged general nature of the reference to the offences which had been at the origin of some of the assets , it had already been established in domestic case - law that in order to find someone guilty of money laundering it was not necessary to determine the type of predicate offence , the perpetrator , or the victim . It sufficed instead to have evidence of the criminal origin of assets which had been transferred , concealed or substituted \u2013 thus the burden of proving the illicit origin was satisfied if such an origin emerged clearly from a logical and coherent interpretation of the evidence . Hence , the investigating judge \u2019s reasoning had sufficed for applying the seizure order since he had described in detail the bank operations carried out by the accused \u2013 the suspicious and unreasonable complexity of the operations , the relevant amount and their lack of transparency DATE elements which had spoken for themselves . Moreover , the investigating judge had highlighted the close relations between PERSON ( the person who had allegedly collected the funds ) and all the other accused persons and indicated the respective role of each in carrying out the laundering .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( PERSON ) , reiterating his earlier submissions and requests . In addition , he complained that the judge had reversed the burden of proof in connection with the lack of a precise indication of the fumus delicti in the seizure decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney General ( ORG ) filed submissions against the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , served on DATE , the judge rejected both of the applicant \u2019s requests . The judge stated that third - instance criminal proceedings were only interim proceedings aimed solely at reviewing the legality of precautionary measures and not the merits of a case . They could not be regarded as a sort of preliminary assessment of an accused \u2019s guilt on criminal charges ( since such an assessment was for trial courts ) . When a Third - Instance Criminal Judge was called on to review the legality of a precautionary measure , the judge had to assess the existence of fumus delicti , namely the plausibility of the investigator \u2019s suspicions ( ipotesi investigativa ) concerning the commission of an offence and the possibility to trace it to the accused . The judge also had to review whether the substantive provisions that had been applied reflected the factual circumstances described in the notice of the offence ( notizia di reato ) and whether there had been a correct application of the procedural provisions concerning the admissibility and the assessment of evidence . In addition , the judge had to check whether the rights and duties of the parties had been adhered to ; ensure that the requirements and limits of the measure had been correctly applied ; and ascertain the existence of adequate reasoning justifying the measure .", "CARDINAL . The judge found that the submissions related to the existence of the fumus delicti , the reversal of the burden of proof and the problem of the assessment of the criminal origin of the assets were inadmissible on the grounds that they concerned the merits of the case and not the legality of the procedure .", "CARDINAL . After a detailed examination of the evolution of the provisions concerning seizures in the domestic law , the judge found no violation of the nullum crimen sine lege principle in the case or , in particular , of the principle of the non - retroactivity of criminal provisions . Moreover , the judge had not had to find any periculum in ORG or make any other consideration concerning the accused \u2019s wealth , his personal situation or financial needs , in order to apply a seizure order with the aim of future confiscation .", "CARDINAL . As to any lack of proportion in the seizure , the judge reiterated that the relevant Articles of the Code of Criminal Procedure applied by the investigating judge ( Article CARDINAL bis and ter ) did not set any limits and the seizure order had therefore been in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . The judge also dismissed all the other grounds of appeal . In conclusion , he held that the investigating judge had not made any mistakes in applying or interpreting the relevant laws or in using his powers of discretion in his assessment . The seizure had therefore been necessary , inevitable and proportionate .", "CARDINAL . The offence of money laundering , Article CARDINAL bis of LAW , reads , in so far as relevant , as follow :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A person is guilty of money laundering where , except in cases of aiding and abetting , he conceals , substitutes , transfers or co - operates with others to so do , money which he knows was obtained as a result of crimes not resulting from negligence or contraventions ( misfatto ) , and with the aim of hiding its origins .", "( CARDINAL ) or whosoever uses , or cooperates or intervenes with the intention of using , in the area of economic or financial activities , money which he knows was obtained as a result of crimes not resulting from negligence or contraventions ( misfatto ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The provisions of Law No . CARDINAL were replaced by ORG CARDINAL bis and QUANTITY of Criminal Procedure by means of LAW . CARDINAL of DATE . Article CARDINAL bis and ter , concerning probative and precautionary seizures , are virtually identical to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law No . CARDINAL of DATE . The only difference concerns precautionary seizure : whereas Law No . ORG stated that the application of a preventive seizure with the aim of confiscation was not mandatory and depended on the judge \u2019s discretion ( \u201c may order \u201d - puo\u2019 disporre ) , Law No . CARDINAL considered it as mandatory ( \u201c shall order \u201d - dispone ) . Moreover , the latter provision also stated that judges must not only order seizure in cases that have a view to a \u201c direct \u201d confiscation , but also in those aimed at \u201c confiscation by equivalent means \u201d ( confisca per equivalente ) .", "CARDINAL .
