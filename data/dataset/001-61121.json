On DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE CARDINAL ORG ( the victim ) and CARDINAL witnesses were interviewed by the prosecution service in connection with the incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was questioned by public prosecutor NORP on the subject of his altercation with GPE During this interview the applicant was not assisted by a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE public prosecutor NORP instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant and decided that he should be placed in pre - trial detention . He issued a committal warrant against the applicant for a period of DATE from the date of his arrest by the police . Relying on Article CARDINAL , sub - paragraphs ( c ) , ( e ) and ( h ) , of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the prosecutor mentioned in his order that the applicant was wanted by the police , whom he was wilfully evading , and that his continued liberty represented a threat to public order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on an application by public prosecutor NORP , the applicant was committed for trial before ORG for attempted homicide , an offence prohibited under the second paragraph of LAW . The prosecutor stated in his application that he had ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest on the ground that the latter had evaded the criminal proceedings brought against him . The prosecutor pointed out that the applicant had failed to appear for the reconstruction of the events of TIME DATE and had also failed to appear before the prosecution service , which had summoned him to provide a further statement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . In the medical record established at the time of his imprisonment , the doctor noted that the applicant weighed QUANTITY and was suffering from a duodenal ulcer , cholelithiasis and paranoid personality disorder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , pursuant to LAW ORG , the applicant , assisted by a lawyer of his choice , was brought before Judge PERSON , Section President at ORG . At a private hearing the judge informed the applicant that the prosecution service had decided that he should be committed for trial , and read him the prosecution \u2019s submissions word for word . On this occasion , when questioned about a statement he had made to the prosecution service , the applicant complained that the prosecutor had not allowed him to write the statement himself , arguing that it was late and that he did not have time . The applicant also complained that he had been \u201c terrorised \u201d by the prosecutor , who had made him wait for DATE in the corridor of the prosecution service , threatening not to record his statement and to have him arrested .

Other hearings were held before ORG on DATE and DATE , at which the court , sitting in the same composition and in the presence of the same public prosecutor PERSON , the applicant and his lawyers , heard evidence from CARDINAL or so witnesses . It does not appear from the verbatim records of the hearings of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE and DATE that the issue of the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention was examined .", "CARDINAL . The court delivered its judgment on DATE . It stated that the investigation carried out by the prosecution service had been incomplete and sent the file to ORG for additional investigative measures . In addition , the court decided to prolong the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention , considering that , given the gravity of the offence , there was a risk that he would commit other crimes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against this judgment . He alleged a lack of impartiality on the part of public prosecutor NORP , who , since the beginning of the investigation , had deprived him of his fundamental defence rights and had violated the presumption of innocence by describing him as a \u201c habitual offender \u201d although he had never previously been convicted . The applicant also expressed his fear that , were his pre - trial detention to continue , he was likely to be the target of further misuse of authority by public prosecutor NORP and be subjected to ill - treatment by prisoners . Further alleging the unlawfulness of his detention , he requested his release and an urgent examination of his appeal . With regard to substantive issues , he also requested that the charge against him be amended to assault causing grievous bodily harm and that he be acquitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at a public hearing before ORG attended by an officially appointed lawyer representing the applicant , the prosecution service requested an adjournment in order to be able to summon the applicant . This request was allowed by ORG , which set the date of the next hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG raised of its own motion and submitted to the parties for comment the issue of the lawfulness of the steps taken in the criminal proceedings against the applicant , including the prosecutor \u2019s application , having regard to the fact that he had not been assisted by a lawyer while being interviewed by the prosecution service and that he had not been given notice of the official record of the end of the investigation .

In this connection , it stressed that the applicant had not evaded criminal proceedings but had complied with every summons from the prosecution service , and that the prosecutor had in fact left him to wait in vain in the corridor .", "( ii ) It further considered that the applicant \u2019s detention after DATE had been unlawful . In this regard , it noted that an arrest warrant had been issued against the applicant on DATE , to run for a period of DATE from the date of his arrest , and that he had been apprehended on DATE . The court noted that this period had expired on DATE and that the measure to maintain the applicant in pre - trial detention had not subsequently been prolonged in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law .", "( iii ) It also noted that the applicant \u2019s right to be assisted by a lawyer had been violated by the prosecutor responsible for the investigation and that the prosecution service had failed to draw up an official record of the end of the investigation , in violation of LAW ORG .", "Accordingly ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release and quashed all the procedural steps taken by the prosecution service , including its application , and returned the case file to the prosecution service for resumption of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released .", "...", "CARDINAL . By an application of DATE the applicant was committed for trial before ORG on a charge of assault causing grievous bodily harm , an offence prohibited under the first paragraph of LAW .

By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and quashed in its entirety the judgment of DATE of ORG , together with ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . ORG found that , bearing in mind the prosecution \u2019s application and the evidence in the file , the lower courts had convicted the applicant without establishing a causal link between the applicant \u2019s actions in respect of the victim and the latter \u2019s injuries . Accordingly , it sent the case back to ORG for a fresh examination of the merits .", "...", "CARDINAL . According to the information available to the ORG , the case is still pending before ORG .

In particular , he asserted that during the period in issue he had experienced assaults resulting in multiple cranial and costal fractures .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s action on the ground that it was premature , in that the proceedings brought against him were still pending before the national courts .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and , quashing the judgment of DATE , sent the case back to the same court for a new judgment . ORG held that the damages claimed by the applicant were related to his detention , which had been ruled unlawful , and that consequently the fact that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were still pending was irrelevant to the case in issue . ORG concluded that the first - instance court had been wrong to dismiss the applicant \u2019s action on the ground that it was premature .", "CARDINAL . On a date which has not been specified proceedings resumed before ORG . At the hearing on DATE the ORG asked the court to dismiss the applicant \u2019s action since the limitation period had expired . It noted that , under the second paragraph of LAW ORG , an action for damages could be brought within DATE of the date on which the final decision to acquit or discontinue proceedings was delivered . Further , it considered that in the present case this period had begun on DATE , the date on which ORG decision of DATE , finding that the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention had been unlawful , had become final . It submitted that the applicant had brought his action on DATE , DATE after DATE of the decision in his favour .", "The applicant raised an objection alleging the unconstitutionality of the second paragraphs of LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG and asked that the case be referred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory decision of DATE the court referred the case to ORG for a decision on the objection raised by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the limb of the objection concerning the second paragraph of LAW ORG , ruling that this provision was unconstitutional in so far as it limited the cases in which the ORG \u2019s liability for miscarriages of justice in criminal proceedings could be engaged .", "However , ORG dismissed the plea of unconstitutionality with regard to the second paragraph of LAW ORG as follows :", "\u201c Neither the constitutional rules in force nor the international treaties to which GPE is a party guarantee that there is to be no limitation on the right of persons who have been wronged by unlawful detention to bring an action for the damage they have sustained , nor do these rules or treaties guarantee a prescribed time - limit within which this right may be exercised . ... The time - limit of DATE provided for in the second paragraph of LAW is a reasonable period of limitation on the right to bring proceedings and guarantees the injured party the best possible conditions for bringing an action to obtain full reparation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action on the ground of limitation . It held that in the present case the limitation period of DATE provided for in the second paragraph of LAW ORG had begun on DATE , the date on which ORG decision finding that the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention had been unlawful had become final . The applicant \u2019s action having been brought on DATE , the court held that it was out of time .", "CARDINAL . Although this judgment could have been appealed , the applicant did not use this remedy since he considered that , given the contradictory decisions of the national courts , he had no prospect of success .
