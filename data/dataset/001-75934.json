The applicant is a NORP national and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a pharmacist in GPE . From DATE he was placed on the lists of jurors and remained on them until DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the applicant was called to serve as a juror in CARDINAL different sets of criminal proceedings . On these occasions , he was called to serve both as a juror and as a foreman of the jury .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was again called to appear before ORG to serve as a juror . This time he failed to attend on the requested date and on DATE he was fined MONEY ( ( MTL ) \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The constitutional proceedings", "CARDINAL . As the applicant failed to pay the fine , on DATE the Registrar of the Courts of GPE submitted an application to ORG . It asked that court to summon the applicant before it and/or to convert the fine imposed into a term of imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . At the sitting of DATE before ORG , the applicant raised the plea that the fine imposed on him was unconstitutional and constituted a breach of his fundamental rights . He alleged , in particular , that the sanction was discriminatory in terms of LAW and LAW taken in conjunction with LAW ( d ) , because it subjected him to burdens and duties to which other persons in the same position were not subjected . Moreover , the law and/or the domestic practice exempted persons of the female sex from jury service whereas , de facto , men were not offered this exemption .", "CARDINAL . Considering that the applicant \u2019s plea was not merely frivolous and/or vexatious , on DATE ORG referred it to FAC .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before ORG , the applicant alleged that the NORP system penalised men and favoured women , as statistical information showed that during DATE PERCENT of jurors had been women whereas PERCENT had been men . Moreover , the burden of jury service was not equitably distributed but was placed on a very small proportion of the population : in DATE the lists of jurors represented PERCENT of the list of voters . In practice , those who had on CARDINAL occasion been placed on the lists of jurors would remain on them until they were disqualified , while others who also satisfied all the requirements were de facto exempted from such civic obligation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claims . It held that in stating that every NORP citizen who had attained the age of CARDINAL qualified to serve as a juror the law did not make any distinction between citizens . More specifically , there was no distinction between men and women . As to the practice criticised by the applicant , the latter had not substantiated his allegation that there were other persons eligible to serve as jurors who managed to avoid performing their duties . Moreover , the applicant had failed to seek exemption from jury service in accordance with domestic law .", "CARDINAL . ORG also observed that the applicant had not proved that he was being treated differently to such an extent that the burdens and obligations imposed on him were greater than those imposed on another person . In particular , it had not been established that people who had been on the lists of jurors as long as the applicant had been removed without a valid reason , or that persons who were in a situation comparable to that of the applicant were left off the lists . The applicant had also failed to submit any evidence showing that the discrepancies between women and men called to serve as jurors were specifically attributable to an intention to discriminate between the sexes or were aimed at giving an unjust advantage to women in relation to men .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE to ORG . He observed , in particular , that the existence of discrimination was clearly shown by the statistics he had produced . Given this factual background , it was unnecessary to prove an intention to discriminate on the part of the authorities .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions , the applicant pointed out that jury service was a burden as it required the person concerned to abandon his or her work in order to attend court hearings regularly ; moreover , it imposed a moral burden to judge the innocence or guilt of a person . According to LAW the Convention , social burdens should be shared by all in an equitable manner . However , statistics showed that lists of foremen were composed of PERCENT of women and PERCENT of men , and that the lists of jurors represented PERCENT of the list of voters .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and confirmed the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court reiterated that neither the law nor the administrative rules in relation to the compilation of the lists of jurors were in any way discriminatory . In fact , the statistics showed that the number of women on the lists of jurors was CARDINAL in DATE ( almost double the number of DATE ) , and that this number increased to CARDINAL in DATE . Therefore , an irreversible administrative process had been set in motion in order to bring the number of women on the lists into line with that of men .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court acknowledged , however , that the number of women actually called to serve as jurors was very low : CARDINAL per year in DATE . This was clearly the result of the jury selection procedure , in which the reasons militating for and against the choice of a certain person as juror were evaluated . The results were dependant on many factors , such as the element of luck , challenges brought by the defence and exemptions granted by the courts . It was true that women were exempted from jury service for social , family and cultural reasons ; however , this was perfectly legitimate and lawful when it was as a consequence of a claim by the defence , the prosecutors or the presiding judge .", "CARDINAL . ORG also agreed that it appeared that the manner in which the lists of jurors were compiled favoured a situation in which when a person was placed on the lists he remained on them until the age restriction was reached . Therefore the applicant \u2019s grievance that this system seemed to punish those persons who were on the lists could be justified . Thus , ORG suggested that the system be amended and that the lists be periodically changed in order to exclude those persons who had already been called for jury service .", "CARDINAL . As concerned the applicability of LAW , the Constitutional Court noted that jury service should be considered \u201c a normal civic obligation \u201d within the meaning of LAW , and therefore LAW came into play . ORG considered , however , that the applicant had not been subjected to burdensome treatment simply because he had had to serve as a juror on CARDINAL occasions over DATE . In any case , this circumstance did not entitle him to take the law into his own hands and decide to ignore the court summons . Instead , he should have made use of the ordinary remedies available to him , such as filing a request for exemption from jury service with the competent court . Had this request been refused , he could have appealed .", "CARDINAL . ORG also rejected the applicant \u2019s submission that the fine imposed on him was discriminatory . It observed that anyone who had been fined by the competent court was obliged by law to pay the fine and that anyone who disobeyed an order of a court was liable to be sanctioned .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE , the applicant petitioned the Registrar of ORG . He observed that , according to ORG of DATE , his name had been registered on ORG and on the List of Special Jurors . However , as he was a lecturer at ORG , he sought exemption from jury service in accordance with LAW ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the Registrar of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s petition .", "CARDINAL . Having been summoned once again to serve as a juror in another trial , in DATE the applicant requested to be exempted from jury service under LAW of the ORG . This application was rejected by the competent domestic court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested once again to be exempted from serving as a juror . He relied on Article CARDINAL ) of the ORG , providing an exemption for full - time lecturers at ORG . On DATE his request was accepted .", "CARDINAL . According to Article CARDINAL ) of the ORG ,", "\u201c Every person of DATE or upwards , residing in GPE and being a citizen of GPE , shall be qualified to serve as a juror provided such person has an adequate knowledge of the NORP language , is of good character and is competent to serve as a juror . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The compilation of the lists of jurors is regulated by LAW . The lists are drawn up by the Commissioner of Police together with QUANTITY magistrates and GPE . They are published in ORG in DATE . Within DATE from the publication any person who , not possessing the qualifications required by law to serve as a juror , desires to be struck off the lists may file an application before ORG . The court shall proceed summarily on the application and the registrar shall note on the lists any correction which the court may order . Subsequently , the names of the jurors are written down on separate ballots of paper and DATE ballots are drawn .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The following persons are exempted from serving as jurors :", "Members of ORG , judges , clergymen , members of ORG , persons holding the office of Head of a ORG and their deputies , the magistrates , ORG , officers of ORG , professors of ORG , teachers of the Government secondary , primary and technical schools , ORG , health inspectors , ORG and ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) Moreover the court may , on an application to that effect , exempt from serving as a juror any apothecary of a village and any physician , surgeon or obstetrician actually practising his profession , and , in general , any person who has completed DATE of his age , unless , in some particular case , the court deems otherwise for the ends of justice .", "( CARDINAL ) A person who has the care of a family or of a person who suffers from any physical or mental infirmity shall also be exempt from serving as a juror . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides that any person who is not qualified or liable to serve as a juror , or who may have special reasons for asking to be exempted from serving as a juror , may bring the matter before the court , by means of an application to be filed within DATE after the service of a writ of summons . The court may , \u201c if it deems the reasons alleged to be good , ... order the registrar to cancel the name of such person \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , if a summoned person ( that is , a person called to serve as a juror ) fails to appear before the court at the time stated in the writ , he will be sentenced by the court to a fine and may be compelled to serve as a juror by means of a warrant of escort or arrest . The court may , on an application to that effect , remit the fine if it is satisfied that there was good cause for the non - appearance ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "4"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["4-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["4-3-d"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
