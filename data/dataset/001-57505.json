Carrillo Salcedo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG The applicant , who was born out of wedlock in DATE , is an NORP citizen and resides at GPE , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG Until DATE , the applicant lived on a farm at GPE , GPE , which had belonged first to his maternal grandmother and then to his mother , PERSON . When his mother married Mr. PERSON , the applicant remained in the house not only with his grandmother and his mother , but also with her husband and subsequently with their son , PERSON , who was born in wedlock in DATE . At DATE , he left the farm and later he married and settled down QUANTITY away .", "The applicant \u2019s mother died intestate on DATE and left as her heirs , apart from the applicant , her husband and her second son . According to the provisions of LAW , the widower was entitled to a CARDINAL part of the inheritance ( LAW ) and each of the sons ( irrespective of their illegitimate or legitimate birth ) to CARDINAL thereof ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . In proceedings commenced ex officio before ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) , the applicant , his step - father and his CARDINAL - brother stated that they were willing to accept these shares . ORG decided on DATE that the declarations of acceptance were valid .", "CARDINAL . ORG However , the farm in question was subject to the special regulations in the Carinthian Hereditary Farms Act of DATE ( ORG , ORG , no . CARDINAL , \" LAW \" ) providing that farms of a certain size may not be divided in the case of hereditary succession and that one of the heirs must take over the entire property and pay off the other heirs ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The applicant had claimed on DATE that he should be called to take over his mother \u2019s farm as he was the eldest son . He later submitted that the regulation giving precedence to legitimate children had in the meantime been abrogated , and that both his step - father and his CARDINAL - brother were in any event excluded as being unfit to work the farm , under section DATE ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG held a hearing in the presence of the parties . On DATE , it appointed an expert to submit an opinion concerning the following matters : first , the classification of the farm as a \" hereditary farm \" within the meaning of LAW ; second , its value for the purpose of determining the sums to be paid to the ceding heirs ; and third , the conditions of its exploitation since the death of the applicant \u2019s mother .", "CARDINAL . ORG The opinion , dated DATE , was filed with the court on DATE . According to the expert , the farm was subject to the provisions of LAW , and its value was CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) . However , the property was in a very bad condition and could not by itself provide a sufficient livelihood for a family . After the previous owner \u2019s death , it had been worked mainly by her widower , who had kept only a few cattle and used all the land for pasture . The grassland had partly run wild and the fields had no longer been tilled .", "CARDINAL . ORG After a further hearing on DATE , the court decided on DATE that the property had the character of a \" hereditary farm \" and fixed its value , in accordance with the expert opinion , at CARDINAL ORG . This decision became final , as none of the parties appealed .", "CARDINAL . ORG The question of the determination of the heir entitled to take over the farm , including the applicant \u2019s claim that his step - father and half - brother should be excluded for this purpose , was referred to ORG ( PERSON ) in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "ORG communicated its file to ORG on DATE . After a hearing scheduled to take place on DATE had been cancelled , ORG returned the file to ORG on DATE , with the request to take further evidence relating to the ability of the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL - brother to work the farm . The expert opinion was therefore to be supplemented in this respect , and ORG was asked to add its own legal opinion when re - submitting the file ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG then ordered a supplementary expert opinion which was lodged on DATE . It stated that the conditions of the exploitation of the farm had further deteriorated , some lands having been left to a motor - cross club and some to a neighbour who had deposited various construction materials there . It was therefore hardly possible to speak of an orderly exploitation of the farm .", "As regards the ability of the applicant \u2019s half - brother to run the farm at the same time as continuing with his job as an unskilled worker , the expert answered in the affirmative . Not very much was required to be done on the farm and his workplace was not so far away as to prevent his DATE presence on the property .", "CARDINAL . ORG At a hearing held on DATE , after several postponements , the parties failed to arrive at any agreement as to who should take over the farm even just for the duration of the proceedings , the applicant \u2019s step - father and CARDINAL - brother being opposed to the appointment of a curator .", "CARDINAL . ORG re - submitted the file to ORG in DATE . ORG decided on DATE to declare the applicant \u2019s claim inadmissible in so far as he sought a ruling that his step - father was excluded from taking over the farm , since the latter had not in fact maintained that he was entitled to do so . As regards the claim for exclusion of the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL - brother , ORG found that he was neither prevented by his profession from working the farm , nor incapable of doing so at the same time as continuing with his job . Furthermore , he could not be held responsible for the negligent exploitation since his mother \u2019s death because it was his father who had run the farm in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed against this decision to ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , claiming that certain evidence had been disregarded by ORG when refusing the exclusion of his CARDINAL - brother . He also submitted that the provision in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW giving precedence to legitimate children ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had been abrogated by the new version of LAW , enacted in DATE , and by LAW . He requested the court to submit the question of the constitutionality of the provision to ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE . After confirming ORG finding that the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL - brother was not excluded , it stated that it had no doubts as to the constitutionality of the provision giving precedence to legitimate children . In its opinion , the provision had an objective justification because it was a peculiarity of the rural family and economic structure that legitimate children lived with the family on the farm , whereas illegitimate children were not infrequently brought up elsewhere and therefore did not have the same close link with the farm as legitimate children . This was also the situation in the present case . ORG therefore saw no reason to submit the issue of constitutionality to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed against this decision to ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) , adducing essentially the same arguments as before ORG . ORG rejected the appeal by a decision of DATE , on the ground that it was directed against a decision of ORG confirming a previous decision of ORG ; in such a case , an appeal is admissible only when a decision is clearly contrary to law or inconsistent with the file , or when there has been a procedural defect entailing nullity of the proceedings . As to the first condition , ORG denied that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of GPE had been abrogated by LAW , as amended .", "ORG also held that there was no reason to submit the matter to ORG , on the following grounds .", "As regards the conformity of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) with the constitutional provision in LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) was applicable only in relation to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in the LAW . In its opinion , the LAW did not deal with the question of hereditary succession , and LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , which secured the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions , did not exclude regulations providing for different rules of succession according to birth in wedlock or out of wedlock .", "Furthermore , there was no doubt as to the compatibility of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) with the constitutional principle of equality . This principle required that legislation make no legal distinction based on the personal status of an individual unless this was justified by objective reasons . The impugned regulations in LAW did not , however , appear to be unjustified . Similar provisions also existed in the provincial legislation of GPE ( ORG ) and in the federal legislation for the other provinces ( Anerbengesetz ) and these limited illegitimate children \u2019s rights even further , in that they could take over a hereditary farm only if they had been brought up on it .", "The preparatory materials on this legislation showed that the precedence accorded to legitimate children was based on convictions of rural society . Neither was the regulation in question contradicted by attempts to assimilate the legal position of illegitimate children to that of legitimate children , because it reflected the special convictions and attitudes of the rural population which , among other things , also affected the legal position of the widower . Furthermore , ORG observed , the family was an important element of the legal organisation of human relationships . Having regard to all these circumstances , it could not be said that the regulations contained in LAW were not based on objective considerations .", "CARDINAL . ORG After LAW born out of PERSON , of DATE , had entered into force in respect of GPE with effect from CARDINAL DATE , the applicant again appealed to ORG , asking it to reconsider its decision of DATE . LAW provides that \" a child born out of wedlock shall have the same right of succession in the estate of its father and its mother and of a member of its father \u2019s or mother \u2019s family , as if it had been born in wedlock \" . However , GPE ratified that Convention with the following reservation :", "\" In pursuance of LAW , the Republic of GPE reserves the right not to accord to a child born out of wedlock , as provided for in LAW , the same right of succession in the estate of its father and of a member of its father \u2019s family , as if it had been born in wedlock . \"", "On DATE , ORG rejected the appeal as inadmissible , having regard to the binding effect of its previous final decision and to the absence of a legal possibility to re - open the procedure .", "CARDINAL . ORG The first - instance proceedings were resumed in DATE . On DATE , a judicial settlement was reached between the applicant and his CARDINAL - brother whereby the applicant renounced any claim to take over his mother \u2019s hereditary farm , which would pass to his CARDINAL - brother . In return , he was to receive a certain piece of land which had been promised to him by his mother during her lifetime , but no other compensation .", "The judicial proceedings in the hereditary case were then terminated on DATE by the transfer ( GPE ) of the title to the whole farm to the applicant \u2019s half - brother .", "CARDINAL . ORG The implementation of the above settlement was left to subsequent agreement between the parties , which they concluded on CARDINAL DATE .", "However , the separating - off of the piece of land , which consisted of forest , assigned to the applicant under the agreement still required the approval of certain administrative authorities , including in particular the competent forestry authority , having regard to the provisions of ORG , no . CARDINAL ) . Certain difficulties arose in this respect . The piece of land was not sufficiently large for its separating - off to be permissible under the above Act except in the case of a predominant public interest , the existence of which the authority denied . The difficulties were apparently overcome after ORG had in a different case found the relevant provisions of ORG to be unconstitutional .", "The land was then registered in the applicant \u2019s name in the official land register .
