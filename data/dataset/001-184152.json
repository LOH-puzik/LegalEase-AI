NORP The applicant , Mr Georgijs Soro\u010dinskis , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in R\u012bga . He was represented before the Court by Ms PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agents , PERSON and subsequently by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested a retirement pension . At that time the applicant had the status of \u201c permanently resident noncitizen \u201d of GPE ; thus , in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions of the Law on State Pensions , the periods that he had spent in employment outside the territory of GPE were not taken into account . Furthermore \u2013 under paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions of the Law on State Pensions \u2013 in view of the fact that the applicant had worked in GPE for DATE , his own average DATE \u201c insurance wage \u201d ( that is to say the income in relation to which the insurance was paid ) instead of the \u201c average DATE insurance wage in the ORG \u201d ( that is to say the average DATE insurance wage of all insured persons in DATE year ) was taken into account for the purpose of calculating his pension . Accordingly , his DATE pension was set at CARDINAL NORP lats ( ORG approximately DATE ( EUR ) ) . As this sum was lower than the minimum pension set by ORG , the applicant in fact received ORG DATE ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an agreement between GPE and GPE on cooperation in the field of social security entered into force , and on DATE the applicant applied for a recalculation of his pension to take into account the periods during which he had worked in GPE . On DATE , on the basis of having acquired citizenship of GPE , the applicant applied for a further recalculation to take account of the remaining periods during which he had worked abroad . ORG took into account the periods during which the applicant had worked abroad when determining his aggregate insurance period ( for a definition of \u201c insurance period \u201d see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as being DATE and DATE ; however , as the employment periods accumulated in GPE had not increased , his own average DATE insurance wage ( and not the average DATE insurance wage in the ORG ) was again taken into account in the calculation of his pension . Even with those additions , the applicant \u2019s pension was still below the level of the minimum pension , as set by ORG . Thus , after the formal recalculation of his pension , the pension the applicant actually received did not increase . On DATE , in accordance with amendments to the Law on State Pensions , the applicant \u2019s pension was raised to LVL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) , which was the minimum pension for persons whose insurance period exceeded DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant continued working , and on DATE he applied for yet another recalculation of his pension . On DATE ORG recalculated the applicant \u2019s pension on the basis of the insurance contributions he had made following his retirement . It took the additional time period worked into account in determining the applicant \u2019s aggregate insurance period . However , as the period the applicant had been employed in GPE still did not reach DATE , the average DATE insurance wage in the ORG was not taken into account in the calculation of his pension . Thus , for a total employment period of DATE eleven DATE and DATE the applicant \u2019s pension was set at ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) per month . Therefore , the applicant continued receiving the minimum pension for persons whose insurance period exceeded DATE , which by then had been raised to ORG ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant continued working , his aggregate insurance period reached DATE QUANTITY months and DATE . As of CARDINAL DATE his DATE pension was raised to ORG MONEY , with an additional supplement of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the decision of ORG of DATE before the administrative courts , complaining that following the entry into force of the agreement between GPE and GPE on cooperation in the field of social security and after he had acquired NORP citizenship his pension had not increased . He also noted that all the circumstances forming the basis of his complaint had been set out in his initial application of DATE . Invoking paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the transitional provisions of the Law on State Pensions ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) he requested that his pension be recalculated by taking into account the time he had worked in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . Having found that the crux of the applicant \u2019s complaint was the alleged failure to take into account the periods he had worked in GPE , the court reassessed the decision of ORG and concluded that his pension had been calculated correctly .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision , stating that all the circumstances forming the basis of his complaint had been outlined in his initial application . The applicant invoked paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the transitional provisions of the Law on State Pensions . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law on the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG set aside the judgment of ORG on the grounds that the court had not obtained and reviewed the applicant \u2019s initial application of DATE to ORG . As a result , the court had not been able to clarify the exact scope of the applicant \u2019s complaint .", "CARDINAL . NORP On CARDINAL DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s complaint in oral proceedings . During his oral submissions the applicant emphasised that he requested that his pension be recalculated on the basis of the average salary in the country . His total employment period was DATE , whereas the Law on State Pensions required the insurance period to be DATE in order for the average DATE insurance wage in the ORG to be used in the calculation . Despite the fact he had worked for DATE , DATE had been taken into account . The applicant concluded by stating : \u201c If you are a citizen then everything is taken into account in the calculation , but if you are not then it is not . \u201d The respondent ( that is to say ORG ) then requested the applicant to clarify the scope of the complaint , to which he replied : \u201c I request the pension to be recalculated on the basis of the average salary in the country . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It observed that in his initial application of DATE the applicant had requested that his pension be recalculated in accordance with general rules . It furthermore noted that the periods he had worked in GPE had been taken into account already since the agreement between GPE and GPE on cooperation in the field of social security had entered in force . Furthermore , following the applicant \u2019s acquisition of NORP citizenship the periods he had worked in GPE and had spent in military service had also been taken into account . The decision that was being challenged concerned the increase in the applicant \u2019s insurance period . Thus , the entirety of his insurance period of DATE eleven DATE and DATE had been taken into account in the calculation of his pension . In addition , the applicant was receiving the minimum State pension in the amount set for persons whose insurance period was DATE . With regard to paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions of the Law on State Pensions the court noted that the applicant \u2019s pension had been calculated correctly , but in relation to paragraph CARDINAL it observed that this provision was not applicable to the applicant owing to its temporal limitation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his appeal on points of law the applicant again reiterated that all the circumstances that formed the basis of his claim had been set out in the initial application . He also stated that his pension had not been recalculated on the basis of the amendments to the Law on State Pensions that had entered into force on DATE . These changes applied to persons whose insurance period was DATE , whereas his insurance period amounted to DATE . Despite that , his own salary ( instead of the average salary in the country ) had been taken into account when calculating the level of the pension to which he had been entitled . The applicant referred to CARDINAL and DATE of the transitional provisions of the Law on State Pensions , as well as to procedural provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , noting that it contained no arguments as to how the judgment of ORG had contravened the legal provisions he had referred to .", "CARDINAL . The Law on State Pensions , which entered into force on DATE , provides that CARDINAL of the components to be taken into account in the calculation and allocation of pensions is the \u201c insurance period \u201d . Under section CARDINAL of the Law on State Pensions , the insurance period is the period of time over which an insured person has made social insurance contributions or such contributions have been made or should have been made on that person \u2019s behalf . With regard to the time period prior to CARDINAL DATE ( when the social insurance system had not yet been established ) , paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions of the Law on State Pensions , as in force at time when it was applied to the applicant , provided :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the case of NORP citizens , repatriated persons , and their family members and their descendants , periods of employment and periods treated as equivalent to employment that have been accrued within or outside GPE prior to DATE shall count towards the insurance period , which is necessary for the allocation ( [ or ] recalculation ) of the State pension , irrespective of [ any prior ] payment of social insurance contributions . In the case of foreign nationals and stateless persons who were resident in GPE on DATE , the insurance period shall be composed of periods of employment and periods treated as equivalent to employment that have been accrued within GPE , as well as periods treated as equivalent to employment that have been accrued outside GPE in the cases specified in sub - paragraphs ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of this paragraph . The following periods , which are treated as equivalent to employment accrued up to DATE ... shall be considered as counting towards the insurance period to be taken into account in calculating the pension :", "...", "( CARDINAL ) periods of study at higher - education institutions , and at other training institutions at post - secondary level ;", "( CARDINAL ) periods of doctoral study , ... postgraduate education or ongoing vocational training ;", "...", "( CARDINAL ) time spent in places of detention by victims of political persecution ... [ or ] in exile , and time spent escaping from such places , those periods to be multiplied by CARDINAL , or by CARDINAL in the case of time spent in the [ NORP ] LOC and regions treated as equivalent . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions of the Law on State Pensions , with respect to the transitional period , another component that is taken into account in the calculation of the pension is the person \u2019s average DATE insurance wage within a specified time period . Thus , with respect to persons who retired in DATE , that person \u2019s average DATE insurance wage over DATE until DATE was taken into account . If , however , ( i ) the person \u2019s insurance period in GPE was not less than DATE ( save for politically persecuted persons , in relation to whom a different methodology applied ) and if the person \u2019s average DATE insurance wage for DATE was below the average DATE insurance wage in the ORG in DATE , or ( ii ) the person had been officially unemployed , the average DATE insurance wage in the ORG in DATE was taken into account in the calculation of his or her pension .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the transitional provisions of the Law on State Pensions were supplemented by paragraph CARDINAL , which provides that in calculating the pension payable to a person whose insurance period is not less than DATE and whose average DATE insurance wage , as calculated in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL of these transitional provisions , is lower than the average DATE insurance wage in the ORG in the period DATE and DATE , the average DATE insurance wage in the ORG over the said DATE should be taken into account . The retrospective application of this provision is limited to pensions that were granted after DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted a letter of DATE from ORG , the relevant part of which stated :", "\u201c \u201c The favourable model of calculating a person \u2019s pension \u201d enshrined in paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provision of the PERSON would not be applied to a NORP citizen in the following situations :", "CARDINAL ) In DATE a NORP citizen requests a retirement pension for a total insurance period of DATE , of which DATE are [ accrued ] in GPE but DATE [ are accrued ] in GPE . The pension is calculated for DATE but the average DATE insurance wage in the ORG is not taken into account in the calculation of the initial capital , as the insurance period in GPE is below DATE ;", "CARDINAL ) In DATE a NORP citizen requests a retirement pension for a total insurance period of DATE , of which DATE are [ accrued ] in GPE but DATE [ are accrued ] in GPE .
