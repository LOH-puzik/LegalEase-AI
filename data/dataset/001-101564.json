On DATE the first applicant asked ORG to assign the case to another prosecutor in view of the perceived bias of the prosecutor dealing with the case . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General assigned the case to ORG .

The applicants protested in front of the GPE police station , then in front of ORG . The applicants were approached by plain - clothed officers , who were shown the authorisation for the march and who accompanied the applicants until they reached ORG . The applicants stood across the road from the ORG and protested by displaying banners and blowing a whistle . At TIME the plain - clothed officers asked the applicants to follow them to the police station because the applicants had insulted them .", "CARDINAL . The protest and the arrest were filmed by reporters . The video footage shows the applicants next to a building with no officer in the vicinity until the time of the arrest .

According to the applicants , they were released immediately after a short period in detention in front of the police station on TIME of CARDINAL DATE . It appears from the video materials submitted by the parties that CARDINAL plain - clothed officer explained that \u201c [ the applicants ] were not arrested but only brought in for identification .

The applicants were found guilty of having committed the administrative offence provided for under LAW of the ORG ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed , arguing that the statement on the banner concerning the prosecution 's failure to properly investigate their alleged ill - treatment by ORG had been based on facts . The aim of the message had not been to disseminate insults but rather to provoke an effective investigation by the prosecutor 's office . Moreover , the applicants had not seen C.A. on DATE . Therefore , even if the banner could be seen as insulting to C.A. , it could not be said that they had intentionally insulted him while he was carrying out his duty to maintain public order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE , finding that the lower court had not analysed the applicants'The case was sent for a retrial .", "CARDINAL .

Minutes later an operative group of ORG arrived , followed by the GPE sector deputy head of the police station , some plain - clothed police officers , a criminal investigator and a specialist . The media arrived at the garage shortly afterwards .", "CARDINAL . The Special Forces officers who had arrived first prevented the applicant from leaving the garage area with his minibus by blocking the exit with their own car and later took his car keys and papers , while the criminal investigator sealed off the area with yellow tape . The first applicant took his animals out of the minibus in order to go on foot to the protest area . At TIME his minibus was driven away by the traffic police , without answering the protests of the second applicant and questions put by the media .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the deputy head of the GPE police station ordered the applicant 's arrest because he had urinated in a public place . The first applicant declared that he had not done so .", "CARDINAL . It is apparent from the video footage aired on several TV channels in PERSON that the first applicant asked repeatedly for witnesses of the alleged act to be identified , and the second applicant asked to be shown the place where the alleged wrongdoing had taken place .

The operative group stopped to find out what was going on , but the first applicant \u201c reacted negatively \u201d to their presence and made direct comparisons between the animals and the police officers , thus insulting them . He then went behind the police car and openly urinated .

The first applicant appealed , noting the absence of any evidence that he had committed any wrongdoing . Moreover , the reports filed by the police officers mentioned that the first applicant had already been asked to follow them to the police station , before the alleged offence had taken place . It was therefore unclear what the reason for the limitation of his liberty before the alleged wrongdoing had been . Since he had not committed any act that warranted his being brought to the police station , the police officers ' request to follow them had been unlawful . Therefore , his refusal to abide by that request , and his resistance to unlawful orders , could not be considered a violation of the law . The first applicant added that the hearing had never been officially opened and had taken place in the absence of witnesses and his lawyer . He had not been had been interrupted and the judge had declared that he was guilty of having committed CARDINAL administrative offences and was fined CARDINAL NORP lei ( MONEY ( ORG ) at the time ) .", "DATE 's lawyer , failing to note that absence in TIME of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the administrative proceedings against the first applicant , finding that there was not sufficient evidence in the file to prove that he had committed any offence and that the police officers who had reported on the offence allegedly committed by the first applicant had refused to appear in court . The court added that the reports , which were the only evidence in the file , were insufficient to establish that an offence had been committed . The court found that \u201c the actions of the police officers were not well - founded and lawful , [ as ] they did not have a ground on which to bring [ the first applicant ] by force to the police station . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
