NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant married PERSON The couple had a son O. , born on DATE . The family lived together until DATE when the applicant took ORG and moved back to her old house . On DATE , after a scuffle with the applicant , PERSON took ORG from her and from that time onwards maintained the actual custody over the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a petition for divorce . At ORG ( PERSON ) request , on DATE CARDINAL experts of ORG ( Rodzinny O\u015brodek PERSON , hereinafter : FAC ) gave an expert opinion , in which they pointed to O. \u2019s clear entanglement in the strong marital conflict between the applicant and PERSON The experts observed that PERSON was being strongly influenced by his father and that many of his statements were \u201c induced \u201d statements deprecating the applicant whom the child perceived very negatively . They found the existing family situation to be detrimental to the child and proposed to separate him temporarily from both parents and place him in a health resort ( sanatorium ) . They moreover advised the court to consider the supervision of the family situation by an appointed court guardian ( kurator s\u0105dowy ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG specified the access arrangements , allowing the applicant to visit O. once a week for TIME at PERSON \u2019s house and under the supervision of a court guardian . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , holding that the access arrangements specified by ORG were reasonable .", "CARDINAL . At the court hearing held on DATE , an expert of ORG recommended that the applicant \u2019s contacts with O. take place in a neutral place instead of the father \u2019s house . Consequently , on DATE ORG provisionally changed the access arrangements , allowing the applicant to meet PERSON on DATE in a fast - food restaurant under the supervision of a court guardian . Due to unspecified organisational problems , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL planned meetings took place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG permanently changed the access arrangements , allowing the applicant to see O. once a week for TIME in a fast - food restaurant under the supervision of a court guardian . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , finding that the right of access was primarily the right of the child and not that of the applicant . The ORG noted that the child apparently did not wish to see the applicant and pointed to the applicant \u2019s lack of patience and her unwillingness to cooperate with the supervising court guardian .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing held on DATE , the court guardian informed the court that during the meetings in the restaurant ORG had not wanted to see the applicant without his father \u2019s presence .", "CARDINAL . At ORG request , on DATE the FAC prepared another opinion . The opinion stated that the reason for O. \u2019s aversion to the applicant had been his father \u2019s behaviour . The experts noted that the child was under the strong influence of his father and reacted hysterically to the applicant \u2019s presence . They urged the court to suspend O. \u2019s meetings with the applicant and to undertake steps aimed at improving their mutual relations . The opinion moreover recommended placing the child under psychological assistance and stated that the child \u2019s father should be persuaded to participate in the meetings with a psychologist in order to correct his attitude .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the court to change the access arrangements and allow her to meet O. at her own home . On DATE ORG dismissed her request , holding it to be premature , on account of ORG recommendation that the applicant \u2019s contacts with ORG be temporarily suspended . ORG noted that ORG clearly did not wish to see his mother and that it would be contrary to the child \u2019s best interests if the meetings were to take place at the applicant \u2019s home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . ORG observed that ORG should issue appropriate decisions in view of the expert findings indicating the child \u2019s father \u2019s incorrect parental behaviour . ORG urged ORG to consider changing the access arrangements and , in particular , to consider the possibility of allowing the applicant to meet her son without the father \u2019s presence , under the supervision of the court guardian , in order to improve the relations between the applicant and the child . It further noted that it would be detrimental to the child \u2019s emotional health if the existing situation were to persist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dissolved the applicant \u2019s marriage without attributing the fault to either party . The court awarded custody rights to PERSON , finding that O. demonstrated strong affection for his father who , in the court \u2019s view , offered better prospects for the proper exercise of custody . The court restricted the applicant \u2019s custody rights over O. , holding her to have been an inept mother who in the past had largely neglected O. \u2019s education . ORG further decided that the access arrangements would be specified by ORG , hereafter : ORG ) in PERSON . The divorce court also held that placing O. in a health resort ( sanatorium ) would only constitute a temporary remedy while putting him in a foster family would be contrary to his best interests , given his affection for , and dependence on , his father .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appeal against the divorce decision and it subsequently became final .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Director of ORG informed the applicant that her DATE meetings with O. would be TIME long and take place on the LOC of ORG . It appears that no psychologist has ever assisted in the meetings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Director of ORG requested the court to discharge ORG from the duty to organise the applicant \u2019s meetings with O. , due to the child \u2019s and his father \u2019s visible unwillingness to comply with the access arrangements . The Director explained that from the very outset the meetings had met with difficulties and that from DATE O. had no longer been coming to the meetings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) ordered PERSON to comply with the access arrangements , on pain of a fine in the amount of ORG CARDINAL ( approx . ORG CARDINAL ) being imposed on him . PERSON \u2019s appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . It appears that PERSON has since then complied with the access arrangements and brought O. to the meetings with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the court to fine PERSON once more for his non - compliance with the access arrangements . The applicant argued that ORG would only briefly appear at the meetings and not talk to her , after which he would leave ORG and be driven home by his father or grandfather .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed her request , finding that PERSON had complied with the access arrangements by bringing O. to the meetings and that he could not be blamed for O. \u2019s own reluctance to see the applicant . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . In passing , ORG expressed a view that the child was clearly being harmed , a circumstance which both parents PERSON and the applicant alike \u2013 refused to admit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ex officio issued a temporary order on access arrangements , allowing the applicant to meet O. at her home DATE for TIME and for TIME on GPE DATE . The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At LOC request , on DATE ORG in GPE issued another expert opinion . Without giving any excuse , the applicant did not appear at either of the CARDINAL interviews with ORG experts . The experts found that in DATE the applicant had been absent from ORG \u2019s life and that ORG \u2019s attitude towards her was hostile . They noted that ORG did not wish to see the applicant and they recommended a temporary suspension of their contacts . The experts moreover recommended that psychological assistance be given to ORG with a view to analysing and rectifying his relations with the applicant . At the same time , they criticised the applicant for her inability to deal with her role as a mother and observed that her motivation for having access to her son appeared to be superficial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s renewed request for changing the access arrangements . It noted that ORG had come to the applicant \u2019s home on several occasions and invited her out for a walk or for coffee but that the applicant , to O. \u2019s disappointment , had shown no flexibility and insisted that the meetings only take place at her home . ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s inflexible stance did not warrant changing the access arrangements . The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the applicant \u2019s request filed on DATE , on DATE ORG ordered PERSON to comply with the access arrangements , on pain of a fine in the amount of ORG CARDINAL ( approx . ORG CARDINAL ) being imposed on him , as the applicant had had no effective access to ORG since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ex officio changed the access arrangements , deciding that the venue of the applicant \u2019s contacts with O. was to be a local caf\u00e9 instead of the applicant \u2019s house . ORG recognised that O. was disappointed with the applicant \u2019s lack of flexibility as to the venue of the meetings and it acknowledged the findings of an expert psychologist , according to which ORG \u2019s attitude towards the applicant was now genuinely his own and no longer influenced by his father . The applicant \u2019s appeal was rejected by ORG on formal grounds on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request to fine PERSON for non - compliance with the access arrangements , finding the applicant to be at fault for the unsuccessful meetings with NORP on account of her bringing other members of her family to the meetings without seeking ORG \u2019s prior consent . The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , ORG , who is now DATE , currently does not come to the meetings with her or appears at the meetings in the caf\u00e9 but stays for no longer than half an hour , instead of TIME specified by the access arrangements .
