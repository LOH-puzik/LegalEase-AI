SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Expulsion) (Conditional) (Kyrgyzstan)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and is currently in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant arrived in GPE and applied for asylum and a residence permit . Before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) , he submitted essentially the following . He is an ethnic GPE from GPE , GPE . He had run a business in his home country and had bought goods from his business partner , also an ethnic GPE , in GPE . In DATE the business partner had been arrested and since he had been in the possession of a receipt from the applicant , they had both been indicted on suspicion of financially supporting the GPE disturbances in GPE . In DATE the applicant had been arrested by the NORP police . His health had deteriorated while he was in custody and , after his release , he had been hospitalised because of his kidney problems . The doctors had informed him that he needed to have blood dialysis but that there was a DATE waiting list . After having been pressured by the authorities , the doctors had informed the applicant that he would not receive any blood dialysis . Moreover , his family had informed him that the police had come to his house looking for him several times after he had left the country . He suffered from chronic kidney failure and was in need of dialysis CARDINAL times per week .", "CARDINAL . The Board held a supplementary interview with the applicant in DATE where he claimed that , during his detention , the NORP police had taken his passport , forced him to sign a travel ban and had also ill - treated him . He had been summoned to appear in court a few times and , after the second summons , he had left the country . He had received written summonses but he had not brought them with him to GPE and he could not contact his family since he feared their telephone was tapped . The applicant further believed that the NORP authorities had contacted the NORP authorities and that for this reason he had been refused medical treatment . However , he also claimed that he had been refused treatment already in DATE , before being called by the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the application . It first noted that the applicant had failed to submit any written evidence in support of his claims . It further found it noteworthy that central parts of the applicant \u2019s story had only been provided at the supplementary interview and not at the initial interview or in written submissions . It therefore considered that he had escalated the threat against him during the asylum proceedings . ORG further noted that the applicant had submitted contradictory information as to when he had been denied health care . First he had stated that he had been refused dialysis after his detention in the DATE while , during the supplementary interview , he had stated that he had been refused treatment already in DATE . In any event , the ORG observed that there had been a regime change in GPE since the applicant had left the country and that there was nothing to indicate that the present regime would have any specific interest in him . Thus , ORG concluded that the applicant was not in need of international protection .", "CARDINAL . As concerned the applicant \u2019s health , the ORG noted that the applicant had submitted a medical certificate according to which he suffered from chronic kidney failure secondary to chronic glomerulonephritis and received blood dialysis CARDINAL times per week . Without the dialysis he would die within DATE . ORG found that , according to the applicant \u2019s own submissions , blood dialysis was available in GPE and , since he had not been found credible , he had also failed to substantiate that he would be denied proper treatment upon return . Consequently , he could not be granted a residence permit and was to be expelled from GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , maintaining his claims and adding that he had not given contradictory information about the refusal to treat him in GPE . He had been diagnosed during DATE and then been informed about DATE waiting time . However , it was only after his arrest in DATE that the doctors told him that he would not receive any dialysis treatment at all . As concerned the regime change , there was no indication that the situation had improved for the GPE people . He further submitted new medical certificates confirming his illness and need for treatment .", "CARDINAL . ORG decided to hold an oral hearing during which the applicant added , inter alia , the following . He had been questioned by the police twice . The first time , in DATE , the police had asked him whether he financially supported the GPE disturbances in GPE and they had beaten him all over his body , including on the kidneys . When he had lost consciousness , the police had become scared and had released him . During the second questioning , the police had confiscated his passport and imposed a travel ban on him . He had later been summoned to court but had not attended . Instead , he had decided to leave the country and had paid a smuggler to help him . After arriving in GPE , he had been in contact via telephone and internet with friends and family in GPE , who had informed him that the NORP authorities had been to his house looking for him and that he had received further summonses . In relation to his illness , he claimed that the NORP would keep searching for him and that he would therefore not receive any treatment in his home country . He also submitted an extract from his NORP medical record which he had received when he was released from hospital in DATE and which he had brought with him to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the appeal . It noted that the applicant had failed to substantiate his identity but accepted that he came from GPE . It further observed that he had not submitted any written evidence in support of his alleged need for protection for which reason his credibility was decisive for the outcome . However , the court considered that the applicant \u2019s submissions were far - fetched , lacking in detail and that they contained contradictory information . For instance , as concerned the applicant \u2019s submissions that the NORP authorities suspected him of sponsoring the GPE disturbances in GPE , the court found this improbable since the applicant had had a clear business relationship with the person in GPE over DATE . Moreover , he had submitted contradictory information as to when he had been refused medical treatment and how many times he had been summoned to court . Therefore , the court concluded that the applicant \u2019s submissions were not credible and that he had failed to substantiate that he would be at risk of persecution upon return .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s health , the court noted that it was undisputed that he suffered from chronic kidney failure and that he was in need of regular blood dialysis and medication to survive . Without the dialysis , he would die within DATE and , apart from regular treatment , the only other solution was a kidney transplant . His state of health was consequently extremely serious . Moreover , the court observed that it was clear that blood dialysis was available in GPE while , according to the applicant , kidney transplants were not carried out . According to the applicant \u2019s own submissions , in DATE he had been placed on a waiting list for dialysis and the waiting time had been DATE . After having been arrested in DATE , his name had allegedly been removed from the waiting list and he had been refused treatment . However , the court noted that , according to the extract from the applicant \u2019s medical records , he had been hospitalised in GPE because of his kidney disease in DATE and again from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , on the second occasion with the diagnosis of chronic terminal kidney failure . Since , according to the most recent NORP medical certificate , a person with such a diagnosis would die within DATE without blood dialysis , the court concluded that the applicant had received medical care both before and after being arrested by the police . He had thus failed to substantiate that he would not receive adequate treatment within a reasonable time upon return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Upon further appeal by the applicant , ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) refused leave to appeal on DATE . Hence , the expulsion order became enforceable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged his application with the ORG and requested it to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG . On DATE , the acting President of the Section to which the case had been allocated acceded to the applicant \u2019s request and indicated to the Government that the applicant should not be expelled to GPE for the duration of the proceedings before the ORG . On DATE , the application was communicated to the Government .", "CARDINAL . In view of the ORG \u2019s indication to the ORG , ORG decided , on DATE , to stay the enforcement of the expulsion order against the applicant until further notice .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicant requested ORG to stay the enforcement of the expulsion order as there were impediments to it due his deteriorated health and to grant him a residence permit . He submitted a medical certificate , dated DATE , by a Chief Physician at ORG in GPE . It stated that the applicant had had a crisis reaction to the expulsion order against him and had not attended CARDINAL dialysis sessions . As a result , his health had significantly deteriorated and he had been given emergency dialysis and had also met with a psychiatrist . He had been kept in hospital due to his poor mental and physical health . It would be completely unreasonable to expel him without ensuring that dialysis would be available to him upon return to his home country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request . It considered that the applicant had invoked no new circumstances concerning his health which could alter the assessment made by ORG in the initial proceedings or which amounted to an impediment to the enforcement of the expulsion order .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant again requested ORG to stay the enforcement of the expulsion order and to grant him a residence permit in GPE since the impediment to the enforcement was permanent . He had been in contact with his family in GPE and , through them , obtained a certificate from ORG , dated DATE , which confirmed that the applicant had been on the national waiting list for blood dialysis since DATE . It further stated that due to the lack of dialysis equipment and the increasing number of patients in need of treatment , there was currently no possibility to offer the applicant dialysis within the public health care system in the country . The applicant had also received from his family a certificate , dated DATE , and issued by the hospital where he had previously been treated , ORG . It stated that the applicant had been treated at the ORG \u2019s unit for nephrology for glomerulonephritis and final stages of chronical kidney failure . It further stated that due to the lack of equipment he could not go through the programme for dialysis . He had , however , been put on the national waiting list .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request as it found that the new certificates did not alter the assessment made in the initial proceedings and that , consequently , there were no grounds on which to grant the applicant a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s father wrote to ORG requesting that the applicant be given treatment in GPE for his illness . He noted in the letter that he had had to send the applicant to GPE to save his life but that they wanted him to be treated in GPE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on DATE , the ORG replied to the applicant \u2019s father . However , the reply , which contains no specific addressee , would appear to be rather a request to the NORP health care system to provide the applicant with proper treatment as it states that , due to the long waiting time and lack of dialysis equipment , it is not possible for them to treat the applicant in GPE and they are grateful for the invaluable contribution to the health care of a citizen of GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
