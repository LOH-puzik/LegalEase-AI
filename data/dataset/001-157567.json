Imposing an obligation on pensioners to contribute to the financing of the social - security system in order to reduce the need for public financial allocation , within a framework of distinct and articulated fiscal consolidation measures which also include tax increases and other cuts in public expenditure , is based on a coherent reasoning in line with a strategy still within the margin of the \u201c free policy prerogative \u201d of the legislature .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... The ORG was solely designed , in conjunction with other measures , to overcome the situation of economic and financial crisis which has temporarily also required , within the framework of the basic options open to the executive and legislature , an urgent strengthening of the financing of the social - security system at the expense of its beneficiaries .", "[ Background factors are as follows : ] ... a decrease in revenues accruing to the social - security system ; the dramatic increase in unemployment ; the reduction of wages ; new migration trends ; an increase in expenditure on support given to those in unemployment and poverty , and the consequent need for the ORG to finance the social - security system thereby aggravating the public deficit . As a result , the legislature , exceptionally and in an emergency situation , chose to extend to pensioners the payment of contributions into the social - security system from which they are directly or indirectly beneficiaries for the present tax year only .", "Compliance with the underlying principles of the democratic rule of law must be evaluated , therefore , in light of the exceptional and temporary nature of this measure and its purpose of meeting the public deficit targets demanded by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ... However , given the constraints that surrounded the implementation of the ORG , not only do the expectations of continued financial stability appear to be diminished , there is also a particular , relevant and defensible public interest that justifies an exceptional and temporary discontinuation of the ORG \u2019s normal conduct .", "The public interest needs to be safeguarded , as has already been stated in the course of the balancing exercise carried out in earlier cases with regard to the principle of legitimate expectations , is of crucial importance and urgent which gives it a clear prevalence , even though the depth of the sacrifice caused to the private sector by the new contribution should not be ignored .", "...", "There is not , therefore , any evidence in this whole context of an infringement of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations .", "CARDINAL . Neither does it seem that the principle of proportionality could be considered to have been breached in any of the aspects of adequacy or necessity or due measure .", "...", "In the current case , it is clear that the imposition of this extraordinary tax on pensioners as a means of reducing , exceptionally and temporarily , expenditure on payment of pensions in order to obtain additional financing for the social - security system , is an appropriate measure for the purposes set out by the legislature .", "As to whether , in order to achieve this goal , the means chosen are actually necessary or required owing to the possible existence of other more suitable or effective means which could achieve the same result in a less burdensome way for those affected , analysis of the evidence shows that there are no other alternatives which could maintain a consistency with the system in which these measures are established , and which could attain public interest objectives to the same degree , and which could affect the holders of the these legal expectations to a lesser degree .", "Accordingly , the measure complies with the principle of necessity .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... In the light of the above , the court holds that section CARDINAL is not unconstitutional . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE , Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL amending section QUANTITY of the DATE LAW was challenged before ORG by a group of members of ORG within the framework of an ex post facto review , on the grounds , inter alia , that the ORG was no longer temporary and exceptional on account of its re - introduction in DATE . In particular , the group of members of ORG challenged the amendments made to section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW . On DATE ORG found that the relevant provision was not unconstitutional . In its ruling the court took into account that it had already weighed up the constitutionality of the ORG in previous rulings and considered that the reconfiguration of the measure remained within the limits outlined by the constitutional - law principle of legal certainty . ORG further considered that the ORG was an exceptional and transitory measure imposed through a budgetary law and had been designed to respond to an economic and financial emergency in GPE . As to the proportionality of the reconfigured ORG , the court ruled that there had been no breach of this principle and that there were no reasons to depart from its previous ruling on the appropriateness of and need for a ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court \u2019s decision contained in particular the following considerations :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The court is aware that ... considerations with regard to the generic nature of the ORG have been raised , and also considerations in relation to its scope and extension ; thus the measure must be analysed in the light of the fundamental right to social security , from which a constitutional right to a pension results . However , according to the applicants , it is the differences vis - \u00e0 - vis the solution previously analysed by this court in DATE , in particular the extension of the measure , that justify a separate ruling to the one then adopted .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... Thus , one can not fail to recognise that , in the way in which it was normatively brought DATE that is , a budgetary measure designed to be in force for DATE the ORG has , indeed , an exceptional and temporary nature which is directly related to the immediate objectives pursued by the legislature of achieving a balanced budget and sustainability of public finances . Therefore , it is with regard to the ORG in and of itself , as normatively set , and with regard to its own nature without taking into account the different nature of any potential subsequent and functionally substitute measure , that the ruling about its temporariness should be made .", "We can thus conclude that it is permissible for ORG , following its previous case - law , to consider that section DATE of Law no . CARDINAL /CARDINAL , as amended by LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , still establishes a transitory or temporary measure , which should be taken into account in the weighting underlying the assessment of constitutionality .", "...", "CARDINAL . NORP ... In fact , as recognised in Ruling no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , legitimate expectations of the State are not as consistently present with regard to an extraordinary and transitory measure , thus justifying an exceptional and temporary discontinuation of the ORG \u2019s conduct . Given the exceptionality of the facts that increased the need for assistance \u2013 the financial and economic emergency that has reduced transfers from the ORG budget to the social protection system \u2013 the lower the expectations of those who were affected by it appear to be .", "...", "CARDINAL . There are no reasons to depart in the present case from the ruling delivered by the court on the adequacy and necessity of the ORG as part of a balanced budget programme . Indeed , this is highlighted by the conflict \u2013 established on the basis of the principle of proportionality \u2013 between the measure under scrutiny and the objective pursued . It is clear that , in general , the extension of the threshold of the ORG is not an inappropriate means of achieving a balanced budget ...", "And the same can be said with regard to the necessity or enforceability of the option chosen \u2013 the second test of proportionality \u2013 since , in the light of the aim pursued and of the potential alternative solutions , it can not be considered that the extension of the scope of application of the ORG is not the least burdensome measure for those adversely affected by the achievement of that goal .", "...", "CARDINAL . NORP ... And with regard to the contribution affecting pensions between ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , the previous regime remains unchanged .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... Indeed , various reasons indicate that the reconfiguration of the ORG by PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE is still within the limits of reasonableness .", "Firstly , the ORG still maintains the characteristics of exceptionality and transience that in DATE marked its entry into the tax universe . ... In an absolutely exceptional financial situation including a fiscal imbalance that led to international and NORP commitments , the ORG constitutes an exceptional measure which , in conjunction with other measures , aims to overcome the seriousness of that situation .", "...", "For all these reasons , it is acceptable that the DATE contribution required of the beneficiaries of social security affected by the expansion of the scope of application of the ORG , owing to its temporariness of the norms supporting it and the objectives it seeks to pursue , does not amount to a particularly excessive and unreasonable sacrifice which would involve a violation of the principle of proportionality , constitutionally objectionable . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
