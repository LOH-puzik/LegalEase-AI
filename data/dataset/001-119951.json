On DATE investigators questioned the CARDINAL individuals identified by the applicant , as well as another suspect , PERSON The latter confessed to having committed the theft together with the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor informed the first applicant at FAC that he was being charged with large - scale theft . The applicant confirmed in writing that he had no objections or comments to make . Interviewed by the prosecutor on DATE , the first applicant denied his guilt and asked for the questioning to be postponed because he felt ill .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was repeatedly questioned by the prosecutor on DATE , and confessed to committing the crime , which he said he had committed with J.V. According to the record of the interview , the applicant stated that his earlier statements were false as far as the CARDINAL acquaintances were concerned ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) because \u201c he had been subjected to duress at the police station \u201d . On DATE PERSON refused to provide a statement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the co - accused , PERSON , alleged that his earlier statement had been given as a result of physical force used by the police . On DATE he lodged a complaint in this respect , which was forwarded to the ORG police for examination . On DATE the ORG police refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged ill - treatment of J.V.", "CARDINAL . On DATE final charges were brought against the first applicant and the co - accused , PERSON The first applicant refused the assistance of a lawyer . On being questioned by the prosecutor , he maintained the statements he had given on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the R\u012bga City ORG decided to commit the applicant and his co - defendant for trial and to maintain their remand in custody . The first hearing was scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing was rescheduled for DATE because the judge was involved in other proceedings . The hearing was subsequently postponed until DATE because the co - defendant requested the assistance of defence counsel . The DATE hearing was rescheduled for DATE due to the absence of witnesses and the victim .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the R\u012bga City Centre District Court held a hearing . The first applicant asked the court to request a medical certificate attesting to his physical condition following the questioning during which he had confessed to the crime . The co - accused requested the court to call the doctor who had treated him after he was questioned at the police station . The court left both requests open pending termination of the court investigation , and remitted the criminal case to ORG for additional pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the prosecutor , in DATE ORG revoked the decision and referred the criminal case back to the lower court for adjudication on the merits . The first applicant submitted an ancillary complaint to ORG in which he stated , inter alia , that during the pre - trial investigation he had been subjected to physical ill - treatment . On DATE the ORG decided to leave the complaint unexamined , on the ground that the impugned decision was not subject to an appeal .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the prosecutor asked ORG to transfer the criminal case to ORG which , according to the prosecution , had jurisdiction in the case . ORG refused the request , and in DATE the case was sent back to the district court . At the regional court \u2019s request ORG ruled in DATE that the criminal case was to be tried by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The hearing scheduled for DATE was postponed as witnesses and the victim failed to appear .", "CARDINAL . DATE the hearing was postponed due to the co - defendant \u2019s illness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the R\u012bga City Centre District Court , after obtaining the first applicant \u2019s approval for the case to be examined in the absence of witnesses , began hearing the case . During the hearing the first applicant pleaded not guilty and alleged that he did not know PERSON and that he had provided incriminating statements only to avoid being physically ill - treated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the R\u012bga City ORG found the first applicant guilty , and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The first applicant had already served this term in pre - trial detention and was immediately released . His co - defendant was acquitted for lack of evidence .", "The court gave weight to the facts that the first applicant had never denied that he had the stolen items on him when he was arrested , and that this had been confirmed by ORG statements . Preferring to give credence to the statements the applicant had made during the pre - trial investigation , the court noted that the case file disclosed no evidence to support the allegations that during his questioning the first applicant had been ill - treated by police officers . Moreover , the first applicant had not raised any complaints in this regard .", "CARDINAL . The court also relied on the fact that during the pre - trial investigation the first applicant had twice confessed to the prosecutor that he had committed the offence . It noted that the first applicant had never complained about the activities of the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal the first applicant pleaded that the statements made during the pre - trial investigation had been obtained as a result of his ill - treatment by police officers .", "CARDINAL . The appellate hearing scheduled for DATE was postponed as the first applicant asked for witnesses to be summoned on his behalf .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lower court \u2019s decision was upheld by ORG . According to the transcript of the hearing , police officer ORG stated that he did not remember either the first applicant or his arrest . On cross - examination by the first applicant , ORG confirmed that force had been used to apprehend the first applicant . A defence witness , PERSON , testified that she had seen police officers beating the first applicant on DATE . The prosecutor in response raised doubts as to whether the first applicant had been arrested in the circumstances alleged .", "CARDINAL . In the judgment the appellate court referred to the lower court \u2019s reasoning and stated in particular :", "\u201c ... The case file bears no evidence that during the pre - trial investigation [ the first applicant ] had been ill - treated by police officers ; moreover [ the first applicant ] had confessed [ to the crime ] being questioned twice by the prosecutor , and [ the first applicant ] had never complained about ill - treatment by members of the prosecutor \u2019s office \u201d .", "It further observed that the first applicant \u2019s guilt had been attested to by a considerable amount of other evidence , such as witness statements and material evidence . It also noted that self - incriminating statements or denial of guilt could not serve as the only grounds to establish or refute guilt . The court further recognised that the first applicant \u2019s pre - trial statements in relation to PERSON had been of a confusing nature and could not be used as proof of the guilt of his co - accused .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal on points of law the first applicant reiterated that his confession to the police officers had been obtained as a result of police ill - treatment . He also noted that he had not lodged an official complaint because of fear of retaliation by the police . On DATE the ORG of ORG , in a preparatory session , dismissed his appeal without examining it on the merits . The ORG remarked that the internal investigation of the alleged ill - treatment did not find that the applicant had been beaten up by police officers .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the materials in the criminal file that on DATE the first applicant asked the lower court to lift the detention order and stated that his confession to the offence had been obtained under duress . On DATE the second applicant asked the lower court to release her son and stated , inter alia , in general terms that her son \u2019s confession had been obtained by ill - treatment . On DATE the first applicant asked the judge of the lower court to request information about his state of health when he was admitted to FAC and testified before the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant , in a representation to the President of the Republic , asked the authorities to investigate the ill - treatment to which the first applicant had been subjected on DATE . She stated that when she had first seen her son in prison he had been severely beaten and had lost a front tooth ; his clothes were covered in blood . The lapse of time between the alleged ill - treatment and the complaint was explained by the first applicant \u2019s fear that he would be the victim of reprisals while in prison .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the head of the ORG police inquiry department ( NORP policijas izzi\u0146as p\u0101rvalde ) for information on whether the criminal file contained information revealing the unauthorised use of force against the first applicant , the judge of the lower court reported in DATE that no such information could be found in the criminal file .", "CARDINAL . The complaint was forwarded to ORG which , on DATE , refused to institute criminal proceedings . The decision , drawn up by investigator ORG , stated :", "[ CARDINAL . ] Under questioning ... [ the first applicant ] explained that ... [ a]t the arrest the police officers had knocked him to the ground , kicked him and hit him with truncheons , as a result of which he had lost consciousness . He regained consciousness only in the police car ... During the interrogation he had been subjected not only to physical ill - treatment but he also received threats and psychological intimidation . During the interrogation many police officers participated in beating and kicking him , for an extended period of time , on the body and head ... In addition , a plastic bag was put over his head , so that [ the first applicant ] could not breathe . In his statement [ the first applicant ] alleged that he had been ill - treated by many police officers , but that he could not remember or identify any of them .", "[ CARDINAL . ] In addition , in his statement [ the first applicant ] alleged that he had repeatedly complained to the prosecutor \u2019s office about police ill - treatment , which contradicts the information [ received ] from ORG [ according to which ] there is nothing to indicate ... that during the pre - trial investigation [ the first applicant ] had been subjected to ill - treatment by police officers or the prosecutor .", "[ CARDINAL . ] When taken into the temporary detention unit of the ORG police station no injuries were identified on the [ first applicant ] , and he did not make any complaint , either about his health or about the behaviour of the police officers .", "[ CARDINAL . ] [ The first applicant ] asked for medical assistance only on DATE in FAC : he was examined and bodily injuries were recorded ; on this basis on DATE ] a forensic medical examination was carried out . It appears from the report of [ the forensic medical examination ] that [ the first applicant ] had sustained the following bodily injuries : contusion on the right knee joint ; contusion on the back with haematoma ; bruises on both arms ( the number , localisation and characteristics of the bruises not described ) , which were considered to be minor bodily injuries causing only short - term health problems of DATE . It was impossible to establish the exact time the injuries had been sustained , but it could not be excluded that the injuries could have been inflicted on DATE .", "[ CARDINAL . ] [ The police officer ] GPE stated that ... he had taken part in the arrest of [ the first applicant ] . He had not observed any visible bodily injuries on [ the first applicant ] , and he could not remember the first applicant complaining of health problems or about the activities of the police officers . If the first applicant had raised any complaint about his health he would have been transferred to a medical establishment .", "[ CARDINAL . ] Accordingly ... it can be concluded that during the preliminary review of the complaint no objective confirmation was obtained as to the allegations that on DATE ... police officers had intentionally inflicted bodily injuries on [ the first applicant ] , as [ the latter ] complained about health problems only on DATE , whereas he was apprehended and questioned on CARDINAL June \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Chancellery of the President and ORG were informed of the decision taken , and a copy of the decision was sent to the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . Following the second applicant \u2019s complaint of CARDINAL DATE , addressed to the President of the Republic , on DATE a superior prosecutor of ORG revoked the impugned decision and sent the case for additional investigation to the ORG police ( NORP policijas GPE p\u0101rvades GPE izmekl\u0113\u0161anas p\u0101rvalde ) on the ground that not all the facts and circumstances had been established when deciding whether to institute criminal proceedings in connection with allegations of ill - treatment . It appears that the prosecutor had issued specific instructions to the investigators .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after obtaining statements from CARDINAL other police officers who had taken part in the arrest of the first applicant , the investigator GPE established that the police officers had used force in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW , in that the first applicant had not complied with the ORG requests and had attempted to escape . The decision stated :", "[ the former police officer ] ORG stated that he had apprehended [ the first applicant ] and since the latter ... had attempted to flee , he had caught [ the first applicant ] and knocked him down , and that as a result they had both fallen down . As the first applicant did not resist , there was no need to apply other means of force . ... [ A witness ] PERSON testified that she had seen the first applicant being apprehended from her window , and that many police officers had spent a long time beating [ the first applicant ] with truncheons and kicking him ...", "... [ T]here are grounds to conclude that the assertions in PERSON \u2019s statements contradict the report of bodily injuries in the forensic expert \u2019s report [ of DATE ] ... and therefore there are grounds to call into question PERSON \u2019s statement that there had been prolonged beating [ of the first applicant ] ... in that the bodily injuries of [ the first applicant ] did not correspond to the [ above ] description .", "... [ T]here are grounds to conclude that on DATE , when [ the first applicant ] was apprehended , the police officers acted in accordance with LAW , and the minor bodily injuries could have been inflicted while he was being apprehended , for , as noted by the police officers , [ the first applicant ] did not comply with their request , and attempted to escape . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision was sent to the supervising prosecutor of ORG and to the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the decision was upheld by a prosecutor attached to ORG .
