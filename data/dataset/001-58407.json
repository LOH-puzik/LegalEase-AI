Mr PERSON ( the first applicant ) joined ORG as a radio operator and in DATE commenced a career in ORG . On DATE he became a midshipman in the executive branch of the navy . His evaluation of DATE noted that he was an officer with \u201c great potential \u201d and the \u201c sort of person that ORG needs to attract and retain \u201d . His evaluation of DATE concluded that the applicant \u201c is a balanced , enlightened and knowledgeable man who enjoys my complete trust in all matters . He is an outstanding prospect for early promotion to commander . \u201d In DATE the applicant attained the rank of lieutenant - commander .", "CARDINAL . For DATE prior to DATE the applicant had been involved in a steady relationship with a civilian partner . In DATE the applicant was informed that ORG ( \u201c the service police \u201d ) had been given his name anonymously in connection with an allegation of homosexuality and was investigating the matter . The applicant admitted to his commanding officer that he was homosexual .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was interviewed on DATE by personnel from the service police about his sexual orientation for TIME . At the beginning of the interview , the applicant was cautioned that he did not have to answer questions and that any responses could be used in evidence later . He was also informed that he could obtain legal advice . The applicant confirmed his awareness of those rights and agreed to be interviewed without legal advice . He then confirmed that he was homosexual , acknowledging that he had been a practising homosexual since his teenage years .", "He was then asked , inter alia , whether he had had homosexual contact with service personnel ( CARDINAL questions on this subject ) , what type of sexual relations he had had with a particular person , when and where this had occurred , about his current relationship and whether his parents knew of his homosexuality . The applicant was asked repeatedly about who had tipped him off that he was the subject of an investigation by the service police and he was told that the question was put because the service police had \u201c a lot of background knowledge about certain things \u201d and there was somebody \u201c providing information to us \u201d . The applicant indicated that he was anxious to assist the service police to make sure that the issue was kept as \u201c private and discreet as possible \u201d . He was then informed that a search was normally completed but the search did not take place since , in anticipation , the applicant had already cleared his cabin of any incriminating evidence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was again interviewed on DATE for TIME . It was explained to the applicant that the purpose of the interview was to ask him about an allegation , contained in an anonymous letter sent to the applicant \u2019s commanding officer some time previously , that the applicant had had a relationship with a serviceman . The interviewer then explained that he was \u201c attempting to keep the need to visit GPE and to investigate this matter to a minimum \u201d , as the applicant wished . The applicant was then asked whether he had had the relationship as alleged in the letter . The anonymous letter was read . The writer claimed that he had recently had a relationship with the applicant , that the writer was HIV - positive and that he believed that the applicant was involved with a member of the armed forces . The applicant \u2019s comments were requested , in particular , as to who would have written the letter . The interviewer also enquired of the applicant \u201c purely as a matter of interest , although it \u2019s a personal thing \u201d whether the applicant was HIV - positive . In this context , it was indicated a number of times to the applicant that the purpose of the second interview was to avoid further investigations . He was also told that it would \u201c come back \u201d on the applicant \u2019s interviewer if the latter did not properly follow up on the anonymous letter .", "CARDINAL . In a final evaluation dated DATE the applicant \u2019s commander noted that the applicant left the ship \u201c with a well - deserved reputation for outstanding professional ability and admirable personal qualities \u201d . He concluded that the applicant \u2019s \u201c loyal , dependable and always dignified service \u201d would be \u201c sorely missed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that it had decided to terminate his commission and to discharge him , administratively , from the navy with effect from DATE . The ground for his discharge was his sexual orientation . The applicant \u2019s commission was removed and most of the bonus which he had received with that promotion was recouped by the naval authorities ( \u00a3 MONEY out of \u00a3 MONEY ) . His term of service would otherwise have terminated in DATE , with the possibility of renewal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON ( the second applicant ) joined ORG , enlisting for DATE service . In DATE he became a substantive weapons engineering mechanic . The applicant \u2019s report dated CARDINAL DATE noted that he displayed potential in a number of areas essential to good leadership , that he had the ability to become an above - average leading hand and that if he applied his new skills wisely he could , with experience , be considered as a potential officer candidate .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant had been refused time off to deal with a personal matter ( he wished to collect his Aids test results ) and consequently he spoke with the chaplain , to whom he admitted his sexual orientation . On DATE the applicant was asked by his lieutenant - commander to repeat what he had told the chaplain and he again admitted his homosexuality to that officer . He was then called for interview by the service police . He was cautioned in the same terms as the first applicant and told that he would not be questioned on the above admissions prior to a search of his locker . His consent to the search was requested and given . The interview , which had lasted TIME , was suspended pending the search . During the search , slides ( of himself , his partner and some of his service friends ) and personal postcards were seized .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s interview with the service police then resumed and lasted TIME . The applicant immediately confirmed his homosexuality , later clarifying that he first had \u201c niggling doubts \u201d about his sexual orientation DATE previously . He was then questioned about a previous relationship with a woman ; he was asked the woman \u2019s name and where she was from , when he had that relationship , why it ended , whether they had a sexual relationship , whether he enjoyed their relationship and whether \u201c she was enough for you \u201d . Details were sought as to how and what he did when he realised he was homosexual and , in this respect , he was asked what sort of feelings he had for a man , whether he had been \u201c touched up \u201d or \u201c abused \u201d as a child and whether he had bought pornographic magazines .", "The applicant was then questioned about his first and current homosexual relationship which began in DATE and , in this regard , he was asked TIME with his partner , who was \u201c butch \u201d and who was \u201c bitch \u201d in the relationship and what being \u201c butch \u201d meant in sexual terms . Detailed questions were put as to how they had sex and whether they used condoms , lubrication and other sex aids , whether they ever had sex in a public place and how they intended to develop the relationship . He was also asked about gay bars he frequented , whether he had ever joined contact magazines , whether his parents knew about his homosexuality and whether he agreed that his secret life could be used as a basis to blackmail him and render him a weak link in the service . The personal slides and postcards which had been taken from his locker were examined and the applicant was questioned in detail about their contents .", "CARDINAL . The service police report completed after the applicant \u2019s interview included several internal documents where it was noted that the applicant , in openly declaring his homosexuality and his relationship with a civilian , had effectively disposed \u201c of any immediate potential security concern \u201d . For that reason , it was considered in the report that \u201c no cause was identified for conducting a security interview with ORG \u201d . That report also accepted that a case for fraudulent entry into the armed forces would be inappropriate given the date when the applicant had discovered his homosexuality . An officer , who advised ORG on the applicant \u2019s discharge , noted that the applicant \u2019s reporting officers had commented on his \u201c affability , intelligence , dedication and ambition \u201d and pointed out that , had it not been for the applicant \u2019s homosexuality , \u201c his ORG career would have blossomed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Prior to his discharge , the applicant completed his duties and remained in communal sleeping accommodation with no reported difficulties . On DATE the applicant \u2019s administrative discharge was approved on the basis of his homosexuality . The applicant then complained about the decision to discharge him to ORG and on DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint .", "CARDINAL . Along with PERSON and Mr PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicants obtained leave to apply for judicial review of the decisions to discharge them from the armed forces . The applicants argued that the policy of ORG against homosexuals in the armed forces was \u201c irrational \u201d , that it was in breach of the LAW and that it was contrary to LAW . ORG maintained that the policy was necessary mainly to maintain morale and unit effectiveness , in view of the loco parentis role of the services as regards minor recruits and in light of the requirement of communal living in the armed forces .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application for judicial review , Lord Justice PERSON giving the main judgment of the court . He noted that the cases illustrated the hardships resulting from the absolute policy against homosexuals in the armed forces and that all CARDINAL of the applicants had exemplary service records , some with reports written in glowing terms . Moreover , he found that in none of the cases before him was it suggested that the applicants\u2019 sexual orientation had in any way affected their ability to carry out their work or had any ill - effect on discipline . There was no reason to doubt that , but for their discharge on the sole ground of sexual orientation , they would have continued to perform their service duties entirely efficiently and with the continued support of their colleagues . All were devastated by their discharge .", "PERSON reviewed the background to the \u201c age old \u201d policy , the relevance of ORG report of DATE , the position in other armed forces around the world , the arguments of ORG ( noting that the security argument was no longer of substantial concern to the Government ) together with the applicants\u2019 arguments against the policy . He considered that the balance of argument clearly lay with the applicants , describing the applicants\u2019 submissions in favour of a conduct - based code as \u201c powerful \u201d . In his view , the tide of history was against ORG . He further observed that it was improbable , whatever ORG would say , that the policy could survive for much longer and added , \u201c I doubt whether most of those present in court throughout the proceedings now believe otherwise . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , having considered arguments as to the test to be applied in the context of these judicial review proceedings , PERSON concluded that the conventional ORG principles , adapted to a human rights context , should be applied .", "Accordingly , where fundamental human rights were being restricted , the Minister of Defence needed to show that there was an important competing interest to justify the restriction . The primary decision was for him and the secondary judgment of the court amounted to asking whether a reasonable Minister , on the material before him , could have reasonably made that primary judgment . He later clarified that it was only if the purported justification \u201c outrageously defies logic or accepted moral standards \u201d that the court could strike down the Minister \u2019s decision . He noted that within the limited scope of that review , the court had to be scrupulous to ensure that no recognised ground of challenge was in truth available to an applicant before rejecting the application . When the most fundamental human rights are threatened , the court would not , for example , be inclined to overlook some minor flaw in the decision - making process , or to adopt a particularly benevolent view of the Minister \u2019s evidence , or to exercise its discretion to withhold relief . However , he emphasised that , even where the most fundamental human rights were being restricted , \u201c the threshold of unreasonableness is not lowered \u201d .", "It was clear that the Secretary of ORG had cited an important competing public interest . But the central question was whether it was reasonable for the Secretary of ORG to take the view that allowing homosexuals into the forces would imperil that interest . He pointed out that , although he might have considered the Minister wrong ,", "\u201c \u2026 [ the courts ] owe a duty ... to remain within their constitutional bounds and not trespass beyond them . Only if it were plain beyond sensible argument that no conceivable damage could be done to the armed services as a fighting unit would it be appropriate for this ORG now to remove the issue entirely from the hands of both the military and of the government . If the Convention \u2026 were part of our law and we were accordingly entitled to ask whether the policy answers a pressing social need and whether the restriction on human rights involved can be shown proportionate to the benefits then clearly the primary judgment \u2026 would be for us and not others : the constitutional balance would shift . But that is not the position . In exercising merely a secondary judgment , this ORG is bound to act with some reticence . Our approach must reflect , not overlook , where responsibility ultimately lies for the defence of the realm and recognise too that ORG is exercising a continuing supervision over this area of prerogative power . \u201d", "Accordingly , while the Minister \u2019s suggested justification for the ban may have seemed \u201c unconvincing \u201d , the Minister \u2019s stand could not properly be said to be unlawful . It followed that the applications had to be rejected \u201c albeit with hesitation and regret \u201d . A brief analysis of the ORG \u2019s case - law led the judge to comment that he strongly suspected that , as far as GPE obligations were concerned , DATE of the policy were numbered .", "CARDINAL . Simon Brown LJ also found that LAW was not applicable to discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and that the domestic courts could not rule on Convention matters . He also observed that GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and the GPE permitted homosexuals to serve in their armed forces and that the evidence indicated that the only countries operating a blanket ban were GPE and GPE ( and , possibly , GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a consultation paper was circulated by ORG to \u201c management \u201d levels in the armed forces relating to ORG policy against homosexuals in those forces . The covering letter circulating this paper pointed out that the \u201c Minister for ORG has decided that evidence is to be gathered within ORG in support of the current policy on homosexuality \u201d . It was indicated that the case was likely to progress to the NORP courts and that the applicants in the judicial review proceedings had argued that ORG position was \u201c bereft of factual evidence \u201d but that this was not surprising since evidence was difficult to amass given that homosexuals were not permitted to serve . Since \u201c this should not be allowed to weaken the arguments for maintaining the policy \u201d , the addressees of the letter were invited to comment on the consultation paper and \u201c to provide any additional evidence in support of the current policy by DATE \u201d . The consultation paper attached referred , inter alia , to CARDINAL incidents which were considered damaging to unit cohesion . The first involved a homosexual who had had a relationship with a sergeant \u2019s mess waiter and the other involved an NORP on secondment whose behaviour was described as \u201c so disruptive \u201d that his attachment was terminated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal . The Master of the Rolls , Sir PERSON , delivered the main judgment ( with which the CARDINAL other judges of ORG agreed ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the court \u2019s approach to the issue of \u201c irrationality \u201d , he considered that the following submission was an accurate distillation of the relevant jurisprudence on the subject :", "\u201c the court may not interfere with the exercise of an administrative discretion on substantive grounds save where the court is satisfied that the decision is unreasonable in the sense that it is beyond the range of responses open to a reasonable decision- maker . But in judging whether the decision - maker has exceeded this margin of appreciation the human rights context is important . The more substantial the interference with human rights , the more the court will require by way of justification before it is satisfied that the decision is reasonable in the sense outlined above . \u201d", "He went on to quote from , inter alia , the judgment of FAC in NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Appeal Cases CARDINAL , where it was pointed out that :", "\u201c the primary judgment as to whether the particular competing public interest justifies the particular restriction imposed falls to be made by the Secretary of ORG to whom ORG has entrusted the discretion . But we are entitled to exercise a secondary judgment by asking whether a reasonable Secretary of ORG , on the material before him , could reasonably make that primary judgment . \u201d", "Moreover , he considered that the greater the policy content of the decision and the more remote the subject matter of a decision from ordinary judicial experience , the more hesitant the court had to be in holding a decision to be irrational .", "CARDINAL . Prior to applying this test of irrationality , the Master of the Rolls noted that the case concerned innate qualities of a very personal kind , that the decisions of which the applicants complained had had a profound effect on their careers and prospects and that the applicants\u2019 rights as human beings were very much in issue . While the domestic court was not the primary decision - maker and while it was not the role of the courts to regulate the conditions of service in the armed forces , \u201c it has the constitutional role and duty of ensuring that the rights of citizens are not abused by the unlawful exercise of executive power . While the court must properly defer to the expertise of responsible decision - makers , it must not shrink from its fundamental duty to \u2018 do right to all manner of people\u2019 \u2026 \u201d .", "CARDINAL . He then reviewed , by reference to the test of irrationality outlined above , the submissions of the parties in favour of and against the policy , commenting that the applicants\u2019 arguments were \u201c of very considerable cogency \u201d which called to be considered in depth with particular reference to past experience in GPE , to the developing experience of other countries and to the potential effectiveness of a detailed prescriptive code in place of the present blanket ban . However , he concluded that the policy could not be considered \u201c irrational \u201d at the time the applicants were discharged from the armed forces , finding that the threshold of irrationality was \u201c a high one \u201d and that it had not been crossed in this case .", "CARDINAL . On the Convention , the Master of the Rolls noted as follows :", "\u201c It is , inevitably , common ground that GPE obligation , binding in international law , to respect and ensure compliance with [ LAW ] is not one that is enforceable by domestic courts . The relevance of the LAW in the present context is as background to the complaint of irrationality . The fact that a decision - maker failed to take account of LAW when exercising an administrative discretion is not of itself a ground for impugning the exercise of that discretion . \u201d", "He observed that to dismiss a person from his or her employment on the grounds of a private sexual preference , and to interrogate him or her about private sexual behaviour , would not appear to show respect for that person \u2019s private and family life and that there might be room for argument as to whether the policy answered a \u201c pressing social need \u201d and , in particular , was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued . However , he held that these were not questions to which answers could be properly or usefully proffered by ORG , but rather were questions for ORG to which court the applicants might have to pursue their claim . He further accepted that ORG did not apply to complaints in relation to sexual orientation .", "CARDINAL . PERSON of ORG agreed with the judgment of the Master of the Rolls and , in particular , with the latter \u2019s approach to the irrationality test and with his view on the inability of the court to resolve Convention issues . He questioned the utility of a debate as to the likely fate of the \u201c longstanding \u201d policy of ORG before ORG with which the primary adjudicating role on the Convention lay . ORG did not entertain \u201c hypothetical questions \u201d . In PERSON view , the only relevance of the ORG was as \u201c background to the complaint of irrationality \u201d , which point had been already made by the Master of the Rolls . It was important to highlight this point since ORG had not given the domestic courts primary jurisdiction over human rights issues contained in the ORG and because the evidence and submissions before ORG related to that court \u2019s secondary jurisdiction and not to its primary jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . PERSON of ORG agreed with both preceding judgments and , in particular , with the views expressed on the rationality test to be applied and on its application in the particular case . The applicants\u2019 arguments that their rights under LAW had been breached were \u201c persuasive \u201d but the evidence and arguments that would ultimately determine that issue were not before ORG . He also found that the ORG challenge to the arguments in support of the policy was \u201c completely persuasive \u201d and added that what impressed him most in relation to the merits was the complete absence of illustration and substantiation by specific examples , not only in the Secretary of ORG \u2019s evidence filed in ORG , but also in the case presented to ORG in DATE . The policy was , in his view , \u201c ripe for review and for consideration of its replacement by a strict conduct code \u201d . However , the applicants\u2019 attack on the Secretary of ORG \u2019s rationality fell \u201c a long way short of success \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG refused leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE Mr PERSON issued proceedings in the ORG claiming unfair dismissal and sexual discrimination contrary to LAW DATE . Those proceedings were adjourned pending the above - described application for leave to appeal to ORG . Further to the rejection of the application , he requested the withdrawal of his ORG proceedings and those proceedings were dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON also issued proceedings in ORG claiming sexual discrimination contrary to LAW . In the light of subsequent decisions of the ECJ and of the domestic courts , the second applicant subsequently requested the withdrawal of those proceedings which were , on DATE , dismissed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , homosexual acts in private between CARDINAL consenting adults ( at the time meaning DATE or over ) ceased to be criminal offences . However , such acts continued to constitute offences under the ORG and ORG Acts DATE and LAW DATE ( Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW was repealed by ORG which LAW also reduced the age of consent to DATE ) .

On DATE the ECJ decided that transsexuals were protected from discrimination on grounds of their transsexuality under ORG law ( PERSON and ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG referred to the ECJ pursuant to LAW the question of the applicability of LAW to differences of treatment based on sexual orientation ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG , ex parte Perkins , DATE ) . PERSON had been discharged from ORG on grounds of his homosexuality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ECJ found that the Equal Pay Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC did not apply to discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation ( Grant v. ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on DATE the ECJ enquired of ORG in the GPE case whether it wished to maintain the Article CARDINAL reference . After a hearing between the parties , ORG decided to withdraw the question from the ECJ ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG , ex parte Perkins , DATE ) . Leave to appeal was refused .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence of the changes made by ORG , updated Armed Forces\u2019 Policy and Guidelines on Homosexuality ( \u201c the LAW ) were distributed to the respective service directorates of personnel in DATE . The Guidelines provided , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c Homosexuality , whether male or female , is considered incompatible with service in the armed forces . This is not only because of the close physical conditions in which personnel often have to live and work , but also because homosexual behaviour can cause offence , polarise relationships , induce ill - discipline and , as a consequence , damage morale and unit effectiveness . If individuals admit to being homosexual whilst serving and their Commanding Officer judges that this admission is well - founded they will be required to leave the services . ...", "The armed forces\u2019 policy on homosexuality is made clear to all those considering enlistment . If a potential recruit admits to being homosexual , he / she will not be enlisted . Even if a potential recruit admits to being homosexual but states that he / she does not at present nor in the future intend to engage in homosexual activity , he / she will not be enlisted . ...", "In dealing with cases of suspected homosexuality , a Commanding Officer must make a balanced judgment taking into account all the relevant factors . ... In most circumstances , however , the interests of the individual and the armed forces will be best served by formal investigation of the allegations or suspicion . Depending on the circumstances , the Commanding Officer will either conduct an internal inquiry , using his own staff , or he will seek assistance from ORG . When conducting an internal inquiry he will normally discuss the matter with his welfare support staff . Homosexuality is not a medical matter , but there may be circumstances in which the Commanding Officer should seek the advice of ORG on the individual concerned and may then , if the individual agrees , refer him / her to the ORG . ...", "A written warning in respect of an individual \u2019s conduct or behaviour may be given in circumstances where there is some evidence of homosexuality but insufficient ... to apply for administrative discharge ... . If the Commanding Officer is satisfied on a high standard of proof of an individual \u2019s homosexuality , administrative action to terminate service ... is to be initiated , ... . \"", "CARDINAL of the purposes of the Guidelines was the reduction of the involvement of the service police whose investigatory methods , based on criminal procedures , had been strongly resented and widely publicised in the past ( confirmed at paragraph CARDINAL of the Homosexual Policy Assessment Team \u2019s report of DATE which is summarised at paragraphs DATE below . However , paragraph CARDINAL of this report indicated that investigation into homosexuality is part of \u201c normal service police duties \u201d . )", "CARDINAL . The affidavit of Air Chief Marshal Sir PERSON , ORG , Vice Chief of ORG , ORG dated DATE , which was submitted to ORG in the case of NORP v. Secretary of ORG , ex parte Perkins ( DATE ) , read , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c The policy of ORG is that the special nature of homosexual life precludes the acceptance of homosexuals and homosexuality in the armed forces . The primary concern of the armed forces is the maintenance of an operationally effective and efficient force and the consequent need for strict maintenance of discipline . [ ORG ] believes that the presence of homosexual personnel has the potential to undermine this .", "The conditions of military life , both on operations and within the service environment , are very different from those experienced in civilian life . \u2026 The [ ORG ] believes that these conditions , and the need for absolute trust and confidence between personnel of all ranks , must dictate its policy towards homosexuality in the armed forces . It is not a question of a moral judgement , nor is there any suggestion that homosexuals are any less courageous than heterosexual personnel ; the policy derives from a practical assessment of the implications of homosexuality for fighting power . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following the decision in the case of NORP v. ORG , ex parte ORG , ORG ( \u201c HPAT \u201d ) was established by ORG in order to undertake an internal assessment of the armed forces\u2019 policy on homosexuality . The ORG was composed of ORG civil servants and representatives of the CARDINAL services . The ORG \u2019s assessment was to form the basis of the ORG \u2019s evidence to the next ORG ( as confirmed in the affidavit of ORG Marshal Sir PERSON referred to at paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The ORG was to consult ORG , the armed forces\u2019 personnel of all ranks , service and civilian staff responsible for carrying out the policy together with members of the legal adviser \u2019s staff . It was also to examine the policies of other nations ( Annex D to the ORG report ) .", "The report of the ORG was published in DATE and ran to CARDINAL pages , together with voluminous annexes . The starting - point of the assessment was an assumption that homosexual men and women were in themselves no less physically capable , brave , dependable and skilled than heterosexuals . It was considered that any problems to be identified would lie in the difficulties which integration of declared homosexuals would pose to the military system which was largely staffed by heterosexuals . The ORG considered that the best predictors of the \u201c reality and severity \u201d of the problems of the integration of homosexuals would be the service personnel themselves ( paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . There were CARDINAL main areas of investigation ( paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) :", "( a ) The ORG consulted with policy - makers in ORG . The latter emphasised the uniqueness of the military environment and the distinctly NORP approach to service life and the ORG found little disagreement with this general perspective from the service people it interviewed ( paragraph CARDINAL ) ;", "( b ) A signal was sent to all members of the services , including the reserve forces , requesting any written views on the issues . By DATE the ORG had received CARDINAL letters . CARDINAL of these letters were against any change in the policy , CARDINAL of which were multiply signed . CARDINAL of those letters were anonymous ( paragraphs CARDINAL ) ;", "( c ) The ORG attitude survey consisted of a questionnaire administered to a total of CARDINAL service personnel chosen as representative of the services . The questionnaires were administered in examination - type conditions and were to be completed anonymously . The results indicated that there was \u201c overwhelming support across the services \u201d for the policy excluding homosexuals from the armed forces . Service personnel viewed homosexuality as clearly more acceptable in civilian than in service life ( paragraphs CARDINAL and ORG ) ;", "( d ) During the ORG \u2019s visit to CARDINAL military bases in DATE in order to administer the above questionnaire , individual one - to - CARDINAL interviews were conducted with personnel who had completed the attitude questionnaire . CARDINAL interviewees randomly selected from certain ranks and occupational areas were selected from each of the CARDINAL units visited . Given the small number of interviewees , the responses were analysed qualitatively rather than quantitatively ( Annex G ) ;", "( e ) A number of single - service focus group discussions were held with randomly selected personnel from representative ranks and functions ( ORG refers to CARDINAL such discussions whereas paragraph CARDINAL of the report refers to CARDINAL ) . The purpose of the group discussions was to examine the breadth and depth of military views and to provide insights that would complement the survey results . The ORG commented that the nature of the discussions showed little reticence in honestly and fully putting forward views ; there was an \u201c overwhelming view that homosexuality was not \u2018 normal\u2019 or \u2018 natural\u2019 whereas women and ethnic minorities were \u2018 normal\u2019 \u201d . The vast majority of participants believed that the present ban on homosexuals should remain ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and ORG ) ;", "( f ) CARDINAL sub - team of the ORG went to GPE , GPE and GPE and the other visited GPE , GPE and GPE . The HPAT interviewed an eminent NORP military psychologist since the NORP military would not accept the ORG visit ( paragraphs CARDINAL and ORG ) . It is also apparent that the ORG spoke to representatives of the police , the fire service and the merchant navy ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) ;", "( g ) Tri - service regional focus discussion groups were also held to examine the breadth and depth of the personnel \u2019s views . The groups were drawn from the CARDINAL services and from different units . CARDINAL such discussion groups were held and overall the results were the same as those from the single - service focus groups ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and ORG ) ;", "( h ) Postal single - service attitude surveys were also completed by a randomly selected sample of personnel stratified by rank , age and gender . The surveys were distributed to CARDINAL ( PERCENT ) of ORG and ORG personnel , to CARDINAL ( PERCENT ) of the ORG personnel and to CARDINAL ( PERCENT ) of the ORG personnel . On CARDINAL of the surveys were returned ( paragraphs CARDINAL and ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG report defined \u201c fighting power \u201d ( often used interchangeably with combat effectiveness , operational efficiency or operational effectiveness ) as the \u201c ability to fight \u201d which is in turn made up of CARDINAL components . These are the \u201c conceptual \u201d and \u201c physical \u201d components together with the \u201c moral component \u201d , the latter being defined as \u201c the ability to get people to fight including morale , comradeship , motivation , leadership and management \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The focus throughout the assessment was upon the anticipated effects on fighting power and this was found to be the \u201c key problem \u201d in integrating homosexuals into the armed forces . It was considered well established that the presence of known or strongly suspected homosexuals in the armed forces would produce certain behavioural and emotional responses and problems which would affect morale and , in turn , significantly and negatively affect the fighting power of the armed forces .", "These anticipated problems included controlling homosexual behaviour and heterosexual animosity , assaults on homosexuals , bullying and harassment of homosexuals , ostracism and avoidance , \u201c cliquishness \u201d and pairing , leadership and decision - making problems including allegations of favouritism , discrimination and ineffectiveness ( but excluding the question of homosexual officers taking tactical decisions swayed by sexual preference ) , sub - cultural friction , privacy / decency issues , increased dislike and suspicions ( polarised relationships ) , and resentment over imposed change especially if controls on heterosexual expression also had to be tightened ( see Section F.II of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also assessed other matters it described as \u201c subsidiary \u201d ( Section G and paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) . It found that , while cost implications of changing the policy were not quantifiable , it was not considered that separate accommodation for homosexuals would be warranted or wise and , accordingly , major expenditures on accommodation were considered unlikely ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . Wasted training as regards discharged homosexuals was not considered to be a significant argument against maintaining the policy ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . Should the wider social and legal position change in relation to civilian homosexual couples , then entitlements for homosexual partners would have to be accepted ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . Large amounts of money or time were unlikely to be devoted to homosexual awareness training , given that it was unlikely to be effective in changing attitudes . It was remarked that , if required , tolerance training would probably be best addressed as \u201c part of an integrated programme for equal opportunities training in the military \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . There were strong indications that recruitment and retention rates would go down if there was a change in policy ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Concerns expressed about the fulfilment of the forces\u2019 loco parentis responsibilities for young recruits were found not to stand up to close examination ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Medical and security concerns were considered separately ( Sections H and I , respectively , and paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) . While it was noted that medical concerns of personnel ( in relation to , inter alia , Aids ) were disproportionate to the clinical risks involved , it was considered that these concerns would probably need to be met with education packages and compulsory Aids testing . Otherwise , real acceptance and integration of homosexuals would be seriously prejudiced by emotional reactions and resentments and by concerns about the threat of Aids . The security issues ( including the possibility of blackmail of those suspected of being homosexual ) raised in defence of the policy were found not to stand up to close examination .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observed that there were a wide variety of official positions and legal arrangements evolving from local legal and political circumstances and ranging from a formal prohibition of all homosexual activity ( GPE ) , to administrative arrangements falling short of real equality ( GPE and GPE ) , to a deliberate policy to create an armed force friendly to homosexuals ( the GPE ) . According to the ORG , those countries which had no legal ban on homosexuals were more tolerant , had written constitutions and therefore a greater tradition of respect for human rights . The report continued :", "\u201c But nowhere did ORG learn that there were significant numbers of open homosexuals serving in ORG . Whatever the degree of official toleration or encouragement , informal pressures or threats within the military social system appeared to prevent the vast majority of homosexuals from choosing to exercise their varying legal rights to open expression of their active sexual identity in a professional setting . \u2026 It goes without saying that the continuing reticence of military homosexuals in these armed forces means that there has been little practical experience of protecting them against ostracism , harassment or physical attack .", "Since this common pattern of a near absence of openly homosexual personnel occurs irrespective of the formal legal frameworks , it is reasonable to assume that it is the informal functioning of actual military systems which is largely incompatible with homosexual self - expression . This is entirely consistent with the pattern of NORP service personnel \u2019s attitudes confirmed by the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE there were over CARDINAL NORP service personnel ( PERCENT approximately of the NORP armed forces ) deployed overseas on operations , more than any other ORG country in LOC ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The ORG concluded , nevertheless , that the policy had not presented significant problems when working with the armed forces of allied nations . The ORG remarked that NORP service personnel had shown a \u201c robust indifference \u201d to arrangements in foreign forces and no concern over what degree of acceptance closely integrated allies give to homosexuals . This is because the average service person considers that those others \u201c are not NORP , have different standards , and are thus only to be expected to do things differently \u201d and because personnel from different nations are accommodated apart . It was also due to the fact that homosexuals in foreign forces , where they were not formally banned , were not open about their sexual orientation . Consequently , the chances were small of the few open homosexuals happening to be in a situation where their sexual orientation would become a problem with NORP service personnel ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Important differences were considered by the ORG to exist between the armed forces and civilian disciplined services in GPE including the police , the fire brigade and the merchant navy which did not operate the same policy against homosexuals . It considered that :", "\u201c None of these occupations involves the same unremittingly demanding and long - term working environment as ORG , or requires the same emphasis on building rapidly interchangeable , but fiercely committed and self - supporting teams , capable of retaining their cohesion after DATE of stress , casualties and discomfort \u2026 \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . Alternative options were considered by the ORG including a code of conduct applicable to all , a policy based on the individual qualities of homosexual personnel , lifting the ban and relying on service personnel reticence , the \u201c do n\u2019t ask , do n\u2019t tell \u201d solution offered by the GPE and a \u201c no open homosexuality \u201d code . It concluded that no policy alternative could be identified which avoided risks for fighting power with the same certainty as the present policy and which , in consequence , would not be strongly opposed by the service population ( paragraphs CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that :", "\u201c the key problem remains and its intractability has indeed been re - confirmed . The evidence for an anticipated loss in fighting power has been set out in section F and forms the centrepiece of this assessment . The various steps in the argument and the overall conclusion have been shown not only by the ORG authorities but by the great majority of Service personnel in all ranks \u201d .", "Current service attitudes were considered unlikely to change in the near future . While clearly hardship and invasion of privacy were involved , the risk to fighting power demonstrated why the policy was , nevertheless , justified . It considered that it was not possible to draw any meaningful comparison between the integration of homosexuals and of women and ethnic minorities into the armed forces since homosexuality raised problems of a type and intensity that gender and race did not .", "The ORG considered that , in the longer term , evolving social attitudes towards homosexuality might reduce the risks to fighting power inherent in change but that their assessment could \u201c only deal with present attitudes and risks \u201d . It went on :", "\u201c \u2026 certainly , if service people believed that they could work and live alongside homosexuals without loss of cohesion , far fewer of the anticipated problems would emerge . But the ORG must deal with the world as it is . Service attitudes , in as far as they differ from those of the general population , emerge from the unique conditions of military life , and represent the current social and psychological realities . They indicate military risk from a policy change \u2026", "\u2026 after collecting the most exhaustive evidence available , it is also evident that in the GPE homosexuality remains in practice incompatible with service life if the armed services , in their present form , are to be maintained at their full potential fighting power . ... Furthermore , the justification for the present policy has been overwhelmingly endorsed by a demonstrated consensus of the profession best able to judge it . It must follow that a major change to the ORG \u2019s current GPE - service Guidelines on homosexuality should be contemplated only for clearly stated non - defence reasons , and with a full acknowledgement of the impact on Service effectiveness and service people \u2019s feelings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG \u201c Code of Practice on Race Relations \u201d issued in DATE declared the armed forces to be equal opportunity employers . It stated that no form of racial discrimination , harassment or abuse would be tolerated , that allegations would be investigated and , if proved , disciplinary action would be taken . It provided for a complaints procedure in relation to discrimination or harassment and it warned against the victimisation of service personnel who made use of their right of complaint and redress .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the army published an Equal Opportunities Directive dealing with racial and sexual harassment and bullying . The policy document contained , as a preamble , a statement of ORG which reads as follows :", "\u201c The reality of conflict requires high levels of teamwork in which individual soldiers can rely absolutely on their comrades and their leaders . There can , therefore , be no place in the ORG for harassment , bullying and discrimination which will affect morale and break down the trust and cohesion of the group .", "It is the duty of every soldier to ensure that the ORG is kept free of such behaviour which would affect cohesion and efficiency . ORG policy is clear : all soldiers must be treated equally on the basis of their ability to perform their duty .", "I look to each one of you to uphold this policy and to ensure that we retain our acknowledged reputation as a highly professional ORG . \u201d", "The Directive provided definitions of racial and sexual harassment , indicated that the army wanted to prevent all forms of offensive and unfair behaviour in these respects and pointed out that it was the duty of each soldier not to behave in a way that could be offensive to others or to allow others to behave in that way . It also defined bullying and indicated that , although the army fosters an aggressive spirit in soldiers who will have to go to war , controlled aggression , self - sufficiency and strong leadership must not be confused with thoughtless and meaningless use of intimidation and violence which characterise bullying . Bullying undermines morale and creates fear and stress both in the individual and the group being bullied and in the organisation . The army was noted to be a close - knit community where team work , cohesion and trust are paramount . Thus , high standards of personal conduct and respect for others were demanded from all .", "The Directive endorsed the use of military law by commanders . Supplementary leaflets promoting the Directive were issued to every individual soldier . In addition , specific equal opportunities posts were created in personnel centres and a substantial training programme in LAW DATE was initiated .", "CARDINAL . Every DATE PERSON Forces\u2019 Bill goes through ORG and a ORG conducts a review in connection with that bill .", "CARDINAL . The report of ORG dated DATE noted , under the heading \u201c Homosexuality \u201d :", "\u201c That the present policy causes very real distress and the loss to the services of some men and women of undoubted competence and good character is beyond dispute . Society outside the armed forces is now much more tolerant of differences in sexual orientation than it was , and this may also possibly be true of the armed forces . Nevertheless , there is considerable force to the [ ORG ] argument that the presence of people known to be homosexual can cause tension in a group of people required to live and work sometimes under great stress and physically DATE , and thus damage its cohesion and fighting effectiveness . It may be that this will change particularly with the integration of women into hitherto all - male units . We are not yet persuaded that the time has come to require the armed forces to accept homosexuals or homosexual activity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The DATE ORG report ( produced after that committee \u2019s review of LAW ) referred to evidence taken from members of ORG and from homosexual support groups and to ORG . Once again , the committee did not recommend any change in the ORG \u2019s policy . It noted that , since its last report , a total of CARDINAL officers and CARDINAL persons of other rank had been discharged or dismissed on grounds of homosexuality . The committee was satisfied that no reliable lessons could as yet be drawn from the experience of other countries . It acknowledged the strength of the human rights arguments put forward , but noted that there had to be a balance struck between individual rights and the needs of the whole . It was persuaded by the ORG summary of the strength of opposition throughout the armed services to any relaxation of the policy . It accepted that the presence of openly homosexual servicemen and women would have a significant adverse impact on morale and , ultimately , on operational effectiveness . The matter was then debated in ORG and members , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , rejected any change to the existing policy .", "CARDINAL . Prior to DATE , applicants to the armed forces were informed about the armed forces\u2019 policy as regards homosexuals in the armed forces by means of a leaflet entitled \u201c Your Rights and Responsibilities \u201d . To avoid any misunderstanding and so that each recruit to each of the armed services received identical information , on DATE the armed forces introduced a Service Statement to be read and signed before enlistment .
