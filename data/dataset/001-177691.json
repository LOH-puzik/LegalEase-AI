The matter of the supremacy of the LAW does not appear to be contradicted by the above - mentioned ORG judgment , which identifies the issue as the act of the President of ORG of not putting the request to the Plenary of ORG , which resulted , according to the judgment , in impeding the applicant \u2019s and the case \u2019s access to the competent criminal court ... It is noted that the President of ORG \u2019s act was based on Article CARDINAL of ORG \u2019s Regulations ...", "According to the foregoing , it is clear that ORG has irrevocably dismissed the request of the public prosecutor of ORG , thus refusing to lift the immunity of the member of ORG against whom the criminal complaint was lodged ... on the basis of a legitimate procedure foreseen by the above - mentioned constitutional provisions . Therefore , according to the legislation , there is absolutely no possibility of reconsidering the issue and , eventually , of instituting a criminal prosecution . During the ... Plenary meetings of ORG , the issue of the well - foundedness of the accusation was examined as a whole , as were all aspects of the case , securing the work of the deputy and at the same time protecting him from malicious acts .

As regards LAW of LAW ... the suspension of criminal proceedings is obligatory , but also requires a prior criminal prosecution for the act that a defendant has alleged or disseminated information about ... In the present case ... the court dismissed the above requests , providing full and correct reasoning , in particular because the immunity of the person against whom the criminal complaint had been lodged , who is now a civil party and member of ORG , had not been lifted . Hence , a criminal prosecution had not been instituted , which is a prerequisite for the suspension and adjournment of criminal proceedings against a defendant who requests them . It can be concluded from the above - mentioned considerations that the court correctly interpreted and implemented the above - mentioned provisions , and did not violate them , when it proceeded to examine the allegations of false accusation , perjury and slander against the defendant - appellant on points of law and dismissed the defendant \u2019s request on the grounds that a criminal prosecution had not been instituted against the current civil party , former mayor and now member of ORG , without suspending and adjourning the proceedings until DATE previously instituted proceedings against him ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
