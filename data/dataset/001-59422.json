On DATE the applicant , referring , inter alia , to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , made a further application asking for the residence application to be heard in open court with a public pronouncement of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . This application ( \u201c the publicity application \u201d ) was heard on DATE in public . The county court \u2019s judgment in the publicity application was pronounced on DATE , in public , although the judge underlined that no reference to the child \u2019s identity should be made in any publication concerning the case . It was accepted that there was nothing out of the ordinary about the residence application ; the gist of the applicant \u2019s argument was that all cases concerning children should be heard in public . He contended , inter alia , that the public had the right to see how decisions were made about children \u2019s lives , and that publicity would serve the interests of justice by encouraging judges , barristers and other professionals involved in such cases to take greater care in their work . In rejecting the applicant \u2019s submissions the judge observed :", "\u201c It is all very well for the father ... to say that the hearing of cases in chambers brings about sloppy or lax practice . I personally have no evidence of that . ... It seems to me that , if such practices ... occur ... then they can be placed before ORG and if ORG so finds that that particular judge can be criticised and if guidance thereafter can be given to the judiciary in general , so much the better .", "... Even assuming that ... it would be possible ... to draw my attention to any number of cases which ... have been wrongly decided by the tribunal at first instance and which for CARDINAL reason or another have not found their way to ORG , I am very dubious whether or not the solution to that particular problem is to have those cases heard in public . When CARDINAL is arguing for principle , one should stick to principle , and I think it a draconian measure to bring about the hearing of these cases in public ... in order to chastise judges or expose lax and inadequate preparation by barristers . I would not wish children to be subjected to any form of embarrassment in order , as I say , to chastise the legal profession .", "... But finally I dispose of this case , I am afraid , in a very simplistic manner . The rules of court DATE the Family Proceedings Rules \u2013 ... came into force on DATE , which coincided with the coming into force of virtually the whole of the substantial provisions of LAW . I think I must approach this case in this manner . LAW itself \u2013 the preamble \u2013 says that it is an LAW to reform the law relating to children . ... It was a consolidating LAW , trying to bring together the various legislative Acts which had gone before , but it was a reforming LAW in many senses . It took a great deal of time going through ORG . I have no doubt at all that various interested parties and pressure groups gave evidence to various committees . I have no doubt at all that judges of family experience at the very highest level were consulted . During the course of its going through ORG it would have been debated not only in ORG but in ORG , where all their Lordships of ORG would doubtless have voiced an opinion on it . ... Not only was the LAW a long time coming to the statute book , it was DATE before the bulk of it came into effect . During the course of that gestation period , rules of court were argued about endlessly , and the rules of court appeared virtually at TIME . They were not made until DATE . There is a long history to that , which is not relevant to this judgment . I can only assume , sitting here , that the question of whether or not children \u2019s cases should be heard in open court or in camera was and must have been anxiously considered at all levels during the course of the progress of this LAW and the rules under LAW through ORG . I can only read , and I do so read and interpret CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , which is the rule to which reference has been made , as being a direction \u2013 a rule of court DATE that hearings of family cases shall be heard and shall continue to be heard in chambers . ... I would want chapter and verse as to what should be put before the judge before he otherwise directs a hearing of a case in open court . I am not prepared in the course of this judgment to give myself any guidelines as to the sort of case that that might be .", "It therefore follows that , irrespective of the arguments that have been placed before me ... , I have come to the clear conclusion that all of this must have been contemplated by the legislature , and ... if any change is to be made it should be made by the legislature . I assume that the legislature knew what it was doing and wished , despite all arguments to the contrary , to continue to have LAW cases heard in chambers . I do not feel that I have any power , even if I wished to do , DATE which I do not \u2013 to hear this particular case in open court . I think I would be breaking the law , in the sense that I would be interpreting in a perverse manner the rules of court laid down under LAW . Therefore ... I feel I have no alternative but to direct that the hearing of this case shall be in camera ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on DATE on the ground , first , that the county court judge had fettered his discretion by indicating that he had no option but to hear the case in private and , secondly , that the exercise by the judge of his discretion was flawed since , if he had exercised it correctly , the only conclusion to which he could have come would have been to hear the entire case in open court .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE ( reported as Re P - B ( a minor ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . In giving judgment , Lord Justice Butler - Sloss said :", "\u201c When LAW DATE came into force in DATE there were new rules of procedure for ORG and ORG contained in LAW DATE . Rule CARDINAL governs hearings and Rule CARDINAL ) states :", "ORG \u2018 Unless the court otherwise directs , a hearing of , or directions appointment in , proceedings to which this Part applies shall be in chambers.\u2019", "... Despite the arguments advanced by [ the applicant ] , it is abundantly clear that the courts are bound by sub - rule ( CARDINAL ) to hear child cases generally in private . That was obviously the intention of ORG and it follows the long - established practice in the hearing of child cases . Sub - rule ( CARDINAL ) allows for all or part of the case to be heard in public . In the light of the long established practice it is unlikely that judges will , other than rarely , hear the evidence relating to the welfare of a child in public . The judgment is in a somewhat different position and it may be that the practice of giving judgment in private is partly due to the parties not asking for it to be heard in public and partly because in the county court , where the vast majority of children \u2019s cases are heard , it is less likely that there will be issues of public interest . Where issues of public interest do arise it would seem entirely appropriate to give judgment in open court providing , where desirable in the interests of the child , appropriate directions are given to avoid identification . If the case raises issues of principle or of law , the judgments are increasingly provided to the law reporters and are published in a large number of law reports which report family cases . But the majority of cases are of no interest to anyone beyond the parties and their families .", "In answer , therefore , to the appellant \u2019s first criticism of the judge that he fettered his discretion , the judge undoubtedly used language which might by reading the judgment in a narrow way be said to restrict him to hearing the case in camera . The judge was , however , recognising that the existing practice of hearing the case in private was restated in sub - rule ( CARDINAL ) unless there were unusual features to the case . This was a run of the mill case and the general practice would seem appropriate to this case . In my judgment , the judge ought not to be criticised for a cautious view of the exercise of his discretion .", "In answer to the appellant \u2019s second point that the exercise of discretion should always be in favour of hearings in open court , it would seem to me that he is directing his arguments to the wrong forum . The wording of sub - rule ( CARDINAL ) is clear . The exercise of discretion remains in the hands of the trial judge and it is a matter for the judge in each case to exercise that discretion if called upon to do so . In the absence of an application to hear the case in open court and unusual circumstances , the normal position would remain , as recognised by the wording of the sub - rule , that the evidence would be heard in private . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , ORG ordered that no one should publish or reveal any information likely to lead to the identification of the applicant \u2019s child . Breach of this order would be a contempt of court punishable with up to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The county court heard the applicant \u2019s residence application in chambers in DATE . According to the applicant , before the end of the hearing the judge again considered whether he should give judgment publicly . Given ORG decision of DATE , the judge concluded that he was bound not to , there being no special feature or interest to justify open judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the county court ordered that the mother should have custody of the child and granted the applicant access rights . The judgment was pronounced in chambers .
