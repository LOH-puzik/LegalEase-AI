On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against the DATE judgment of ORG . In that appeal they requested their release under LAW , relying on their right to the presumption of innocence . They argued that under LAW reopening of proceedings had invalidated the finality of their first conviction . They pointed out that in the event of an application for reopening of proceedings the law was silent on the issue of the execution of the initial sentence and on the conduct of the future proceedings . The applicants submitted that the absence of provisions in that regard did not mean that there was a legal vacuum provided that any proceedings reopened returned to the trial phase . They added that persons being retried no longer had the status of convicted persons , which meant that the restriction on their liberty could no longer be considered as being in \u201c execution \u201d of the sentence initially imposed on them . Consequently , they concluded that the reopening of the proceedings had given them prisoner status , and that they had therefore lost their \u201c convict \u201d status .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicants submitted another brief memorial to ORG , arguing , in particular , that by referring to them as \u201c convicted persons \u201d ORG had flouted their right to the presumption of innocence .
