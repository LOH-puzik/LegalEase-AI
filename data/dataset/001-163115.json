In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of Eastern GPE unanimously found that the refusal to grant the applicants family reunion with reference to the DATE rule and the attachment requirement did not contravene the Articles of the Convention or of LAW relied upon . It stated as follows :", "\u201c ... the facts given in the decisions of the immigration authorities in the case are found not to be in dispute .", "Accordingly , [ the second applicant ] who is a NORP national , was thus DATE when she applied for a residence permit on DATE , and she had no ties with GPE other than her recent marriage to [ the first applicant ] . [ The second applicant ] had always lived in GPE and had family there . [ The first applicant ] had some ties with GPE , where he had lived with his uncle while attending school in GPE for DATE . He entered GPE in DATE at DATE and became a NORP national on DATE . [ The applicants ] married in GPE on DATE and have lived in GPE since DATE with their child , born on DATE . [ The first applicant ] has told ORG that the family can settle lawfully in GPE if he obtains paid employment in that country .", "It appears from a ORG judgment of DATE , reproduced on page CARDINAL in the NORP Weekly Law Reports ( ORG for DATE , that LAW does not impose on ORG any general obligation to respect immigrants\u2019 choices as to the country of their residence in connection with marriage , or otherwise to authorise family reunion .", "In view of the information on [ the applicants\u2019 ] situation and their ties with GPE , ORG accordingly finds no basis for setting aside the Respondent \u2019s decision establishing that [ the applicants\u2019 ] aggregate ties with GPE were stronger than their aggregate ties with GPE and that [ the applicants ] therefore did not meet the attachment requirement set out in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW . In this connection , the High Court finds that the refusal did not bar [ the applicants ] from exercising their right to family life in GPE or in a country other than GPE . The fact that [ the first applicant ] is able to reside in GPE only if he obtains paid employment there is found not to lead to any other assessment . Accordingly , ORG holds that the decision of ORG did not constitute a breach of LAW .", "Although ORG has held that LAW has not been breached in this case , ORG has to consider [ the applicants\u2019 ] claim that , within the substantive area otherwise protected by DATE , the decision of ORG constituted a breach of Article CARDINAL read in conjunction with Article CARDINAL of the Convention .", "ORG initially observes that [ the first applicant ] had been residing in GPE for DATE when the ORG issued its decision . Although he acquired NORP nationality in DATE , DATE after entering GPE , he did not meet the CARDINALyear nationality requirement applicable to all NORP nationals pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW , irrespective of whether they are of foreign or NORP extraction . Nor did he have the comparable attachment to GPE throughout DATE which will generally lead to an exemption from the attachment requirement according to the preparatory work of the DATE statutory amendment .", "The CARDINAL-year rule is a generally - worded relaxation of the attachment requirement based on an objective criterion . In practice , however , the rule may imply that a NORP national of foreign extraction will only meet the CARDINAL-year rule later in life than would be the case for a NORP national of NORP extraction . When applied , the rule may therefore imply an indirect discrimination .", "According to the relevant explanatory report , LAW must be taken to mean that LAW concerns the conditions for acquiring nationality while LAW concerns the principle of non - discrimination . According to the report , it is not a mandatory rule that GPE are obliged to observe in all situations . Against that background , LAW is considered to offer protection against discrimination to an extent that goes no further than the protection against discrimination offered by LAW .", "The assessment of whether the refusal of the ORG implied discrimination amounting to a breach of LAW read in conjunction with LAW is accordingly considered to depend on whether the difference in treatment which occurred as a consequence of the attachment requirement in spite of nationality can be considered objectively justified and proportionate .", "According to the preparatory work of the LAW , the overall aim of the attachment requirement , which is a requirement of lasting and strong links to GPE , is to regulate spousal reunion in GPE in such a manner as to ensure the best possible integration of immigrants in GPE , an aim which must in itself be considered objective . In the view of ORG , any difference in treatment between NORP nationals of NORP extraction and NORP nationals of foreign extraction can therefore be justified by this aim as regards the right to spousal reunion if a NORP national of foreign extraction has no such lasting and strong attachment to GPE .", "The balancing of this overall consideration relating to the specific circumstances in the case requires a detailed assessment . The High Court finds that the assessment and decision of the Ministry were made in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW and the preparatory work describing the application of the provision . Accordingly , and in view of the specific information on [ the first applicant \u2019s ] situation , the High Court finds no sufficient basis for holding that the refusal by the Ministry to grant a residence permit to [ the second applicant ] with reference to the attachment requirement of LAW implies a disproportionate infringement of [ the first applicant \u2019s ] rights as a NORP national and his right to family life . ORG therefore finds that the decision of ORG was not invalid , and that it was not contrary to LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the judgment to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) , which delivered its judgment on DATE upholding the ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG , composed of CARDINAL judges , found , unanimously , that it was not in breach of LAW to refuse the second applicant a residence permit in GPE . It stated as follows :", "\u201c In its decision of DATE , ORG refused the application from [ the second applicant ] for a residence permit on the grounds that the aggregate ties of herself and her spouse [ the first applicant ] with GPE were not stronger than their aggregate ties with GPE ( see section CARDINAL , subsection DATE , of LAW ) .", "[ The applicants ] first submitted that the refusal was unlawful because it was contrary to LAW . If the refusal was not contrary to LAW , they submitted as their alternative claim that it was contrary to the prohibition against discrimination enshrined in LAW read in conjunction with LAW , for which reason they were eligible for family reunion in GPE without satisfying the attachment requirement set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act .", "For the reasons given by ORG , ORG upholds the decision made by ORG that it is not contrary to Article CARDINAL to refuse [ the second applicant \u2019s ] application for a residence permit . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the majority in ORG ( CARDINAL judges ) found that the DATE rule was in compliance with LAW in conjunction with LAW . They stated as follows :", "\u201c Pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection DATE , as worded by LAW . CARDINAL of DATE , the requirement that the spouses\u2019 or ORG aggregate ties with GPE must be stronger than their aggregate ties with another country ( the attachment requirement ) does not apply when the resident has been a NORP national for DATE ( the CARDINAL-year rule ) .", "Until DATE , NORP nationals had had a general exemption from the attachment requirement . Act No . CARDINAL of DATE tightened the conditions of family reunion , CARDINAL of the consequences being that the attachment requirement would subsequently also apply to family reunion where CARDINAL of the partners was a NORP national . CARDINAL of the reasons for extending the attachment requirement to include NORP nationals also given in the preparatory work ( on page CARDINAL of Schedule A to ORG for DATE ( CARDINALnd session ) ) is that there are NORP nationals who are not particularly well integrated in NORP society and for this reason the integration of a spouse newly arrived in GPE may entail major problems .", "It quickly turned out that this tightening had some unintended consequences for persons such as NORP nationals who had opted to live abroad for a lengthy period and who had started a family while away from GPE . For that reason , the rules were relaxed with effect from DATE so that family reunion in cases where CARDINAL of the partners had been a NORP national for DATE was no longer subject to satisfaction of the requirement of stronger aggregate ties with GPE .", "According to the preparatory work in respect of the relaxation , the ORG found that the fundamental aim of tightening the attachment requirement in DATE was not forfeited by refraining from demanding that the attachment requirement be met in cases where the resident had been a NORP national for DATE ( see page CARDINAL of Schedule A to ORG for DATE ) . It is mentioned in this connection that NORP expatriates planning to return to GPE DATE with their families will often have maintained strong ties with GPE , which have also been communicated to their spouse or cohabitant and any children . This is so when they speak LANGUAGE at home , take holidays in GPE , read NORP newspapers regularly , and so on . Thus , there will normally be a basis for successful integration of NORP expatriates\u2019 family members into NORP society .", "Persons who have not been NORP nationals for DATE , but were born and raised in GPE , or came to GPE as small children and were raised here , are normally also exempt from the attachment requirement when they have stayed lawfully in GPE for DATE .", "A consequence of this current state of the law is that different groups of NORP nationals are subject to differences in treatment in relation to their possibility of being reunited with family members in GPE , as persons who have been NORP nationals for DATE are in a better position than persons who have been NORP nationals for DATE .", "According to the case - law of ORG , nationals of a country do not have an unconditional right to family reunion with a foreigner in their home country , as factors of attachment may also be taken into account in the case of nationals of that country . It is not in itself contrary to the LAW if different groups of nationals are subject to statutory differences in treatment as regards the possibility of obtaining family reunion with a foreigner in the country of their nationality .", "In this respect , reference is made to paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment delivered by ORG DATE in the case of ORG and NORP v. GPE . In this case the ORG found that it was not contrary to the LAW that a person born in GPE who had later moved to GPE and become a national of GPE was treated less favourably as regards the right to family reunion with a foreigner than a national born in GPE or whose parent(s ) were born in GPE . The ORG said in that respect : \u2018 It is true that a person who , like PERSON , has been settled in a country for DATE may also have formed close ties with it , even if he or she was not born there . Nevertheless , there are in general persuasive social reasons for giving special treatment to those whose links with a country stem from birth within it . The difference of treatment must therefore be regarded as having had an objective and reasonable justification and , in particular , its results have not been shown to transgress the principle of proportionality.\u2019 The ORG then held that PERSON was not a victim of discrimination on the ground of birth .", "As regards PERSON , who was a national of GPE , it was not contrary to the Convention to make it an additional requirement for family reunion that she must have been born in GPE . A different additional requirement is made under NORP law : a requirement of NORP nationality for DATE . The question is whether [ the first applicant ] is subjected to discrimination contrary to the Convention owing to this criterion .", "We find that the criterion of DATE of NORP nationality has the same aim as the requirement of birth in GPE , which was accepted by ORG in the DATE judgment as not being contrary to the Convention : to distinguish a group of nationals who , seen from a general perspective , had lasting and strong ties with the country .", "In general , a person of DATE who has held NORP nationality since birth will have stronger real ties with GPE and greater insight into NORP society than a DATE person who DATE like [ the first applicant ] \u2013 only established links with NORP society as a young person or an adult . This also applies to NORP nationals who have stayed abroad for a shorter or longer period , for example in connection with education or work . We find that the CARDINAL-year - rule is based on an objective criterion , as it must be considered objectively justified to select a group of nationals with such strong ties with GPE when assessed from a general perspective that it will be unproblematic to grant family reunion with a foreign spouse or cohabitant in GPE as it will normally be possible for such spouse or cohabitant to be successfully integrated into NORP society .", "Even though it is conceivable that a national who has had NORP nationality for DATE may in fact have weaker ties with GPE than a national who has had NORP nationality for a shorter period , this does not imply that the CARDINAL-year rule should be set aside pursuant to ORG Reference is made to the case , relative to the then applicable additional NORP requirement of place of birth considered by ORG , of a national who was not born in GPE , but who had in reality stronger ties with GPE than other nationals who satisfied the requirement of place of birth , but had moved abroad with their parents at a tender age or maybe had even been born abroad . It is noted in this respect that it was sufficient to satisfy the then NORP requirement of place of birth for CARDINAL of the relevant person \u2019s parents to have been born in GPE .", "We also find that the consequences of the DATE rule can not be considered disproportionate relative to [ the first applicant ] . [ He ] was born in GPE in DATE and came to GPE in DATE . After DATE residence , he became a NORP national in DATE . In DATE he married [ the second applicant ] and applied for reunion with his spouse in GPE . The application was finally refused in DATE . The factual circumstances of this case are thus in most material aspects identical to PERSON situation assessed by ORG in its judgment in DATE , when the ORG found that the principle of proportionality had not been violated . She was born in GPE in DATE or DATE . She first went to GPE in DATE and obtained nationality of GPE in DATE . She married a NORP national NORP in DATE , and their application for spousal reunion in GPE for the husband of a NORP national was refused DATE . A comparison of the CARDINAL cases reveals that both [ the first applicant ] and PERSON only came to GPE and GPE , respectively , as adults . In [ the first applicant \u2019s ] case , the application was refused when he had resided in GPE for DATE , CARDINAL of which as a NORP national . In PERSON case , the application was refused after she had resided in GPE for DATE , CARDINAL of which as a NORP national .", "On these grounds we find no basis in case - law to find that the DATE rule implied discrimination against [ the first applicant ] contrary to the LAW .", "As regards the significance of LAW DATE , we find for the reasons stated by ORG that it can not be a consequence of LAW that the scope of the prohibition against discrimination based on LAW read in conjunction with LAW should be extended further than justified by the DATE judgment .", "We hold on this basis that the refusal of residence for [ the second applicant ] given by ORG can not be set aside as being invalid because it is contrary to LAW .", "For this reason we vote in favour of upholding the High Court judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A minority of CARDINAL judges were of the view that the DATE rule implied indirect discrimination between persons who were born NORP citizens and persons who had acquired NORP citizenship later in life . Since persons who were born NORP citizens would usually be of NORP ethnic origin , whereas persons who acquired NORP citizenship at a later point in their life would generally be of foreign ethnic origin , the CARDINAL-year rule also entailed indirect discrimination between ethnic NORP citizens and NORP citizens with a foreign ethnic background . More specifically , they stated as follows :", "\u201c As stated by the majority , the requirement of section CARDINAL , subsection DATE , of LAW that the spouses\u2019 or ORG aggregate ties with GPE must be stronger than their aggregate ties with another country ( the attachment requirement ) does not apply when the resident person has been a NORP national for DATE ( the CARDINALyear rule ) .", "The CARDINAL-year rule applies both to persons born NORP nationals and to persons acquiring NORP nationality later in life , but in reality the significance of the rule differs greatly for the CARDINAL groups of NORP nationals . For persons born NORP nationals , the rule only implies that the attachment requirement applies until they are DATE . For persons not raised in GPE who acquire NORP nationality later in life , the rule implies that the attachment requirement applies until DATE have passed after the date when any such person became a NORP national . As an example , [ the first applicant ] who became a NORP national at DATE , will be subject to the attachment requirement until he is DATE . The CARDINAL-year rule therefore implies that the major restriction of the right to spousal reunion resulting from the attachment requirement will affect persons who only acquire NORP nationality later in life far more often and with a far greater impact than persons born with NORP nationality . Hence , the CARDINAL-year rule results in obvious indirect difference in treatment between the CARDINAL groups of NORP nationals .", "The vast majority of persons born NORP nationals will be of NORP ethnic origin , while persons acquiring NORP nationality later in life will generally be of other ethnic origin . At the same time , the CARDINAL-year rule therefore implies obvious indirect difference in treatment between NORP nationals of NORP ethnic origin and NORP nationals of other ethnic origin regarding the right to spousal reunion .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , the attachment requirement may be disregarded if exceptional reasons make this appropriate . According to the preparatory work of LAW , this possibility of exemption is to be administered in such a manner that aliens who were born and raised in GPE or who came to GPE as small children and were raised here must be treated comparably to NORP nationals , which means that they will be exempt from the attachment requirement when they have lawfully resided in GPE for DATE . However , relative to persons who were not raised in GPE , but acquire NORP nationality later in life , this does not alter the situation described above concerning the indirect difference in treatment implied by the CARDINAL-year rule .", "When the attachment requirement was introduced by Act No . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , all NORP nationals were exempt from the requirement . Act No . CARDINAL of DATE made the attachment requirement generally applicable also to NORP nationals . Concerning the reason for this , the preparatory work in respect of the LAW states , inter alia : \u2018 With resident aliens and NORP nationals of foreign extraction it is a widespread marriage pattern to marry a person from their country of origin , among other reasons due to parental pressure ... The Government find that the attachment requirement , as it is worded DATE , does not take sufficient account of the existence of this marriage pattern among both resident foreigners and resident NORP nationals of foreign extraction . There are thus also NORP nationals who are not well integrated into NORP society and where integration of a spouse newly arrived in GPE may therefore entail major problems.\u2019 By Act No . CARDINAL of DATE , the application of the attachment requirement to NORP nationals was restricted through the CARDINAL-year rule , and the preparatory work in respect of the LAW stated that the purpose was , inter alia , \u2018 to ensure that NORP expatriates with strong and lasting ties to GPE in the form of DATE of NORP nationality will be able to obtain spousal reunion in ORG . In the light of these notes , it is considered a fact that the indirect difference in treatment between NORP nationals of NORP ethnic extraction and NORP nationals of other ethnic extraction following from the CARDINAL-year rule is an intended consequence .", "Under LAW , the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognised by the LAW , including the individual \u2019s right under LAW for his or her family life , must be \u2018 secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , association with a national minority , property , birth or other status\u2019 . As mentioned above , the CARDINAL-year rule implies both indirect difference in treatment between persons born NORP nationals and persons only acquiring NORP nationality later in life and , in the same connection , indirect difference in treatment between NORP nationals of NORP ethnic extraction and NORP nationals of other ethnic extraction . Both these types of indirect difference in treatment must be considered to fall within Article CARDINAL read in conjunction with Article CARDINAL of the Convention . The QUANTITY types of indirect difference in treatment implied by the CARDINALyear rule are therefore contrary to LAW unless the difference in treatment can be considered objectively justified and proportionate .", "LAW of DATE , which has been ratified by GPE , provides in LAW : \u2018 ORG shall be guided by the principle of non - discrimination between its nationals , whether they are nationals by birth or have acquired its nationality PERSON . The memorandum of DATE made by ORG and the memorandum of DATE made by the working group composed of representatives of ORG , ORG and ORG state that the provision solely concerns issues on the revocation and loss of nationality . In our opinion it is dubious whether there is any basis for such a restrictive interpretation as the provision , according to its wording , comprises any difference in treatment exercised as a consequence of how and when nationality was acquired . As is apparent from the explanatory report , the provision is not a prohibition from which no derogation may be made , and the provision must be taken to mean that it may be derogated from if the difference in treatment is objectively justified and proportionate . However , when assessing the CARDINAL-year rule relative to LAW read in conjunction with LAW , we consider it necessary to include the fact that , at least according to its wording , LAW comprises a general provision stating that any difference in treatment between different groups of ORG own nationals is basically prohibited .", "In an assessment made under LAW read in conjunction with LAW , another factor to be taken into consideration is the crucial importance of being entitled to settle with one \u2019s spouse in the country of one \u2019s nationality .", "As mentioned , NORP nationals were originally generally exempt from the attachment requirement . ORG established in a judgment reproduced on p. CARDINAL in the NORP Weekly Law Reports for DATE that discrimination relative to the right to spousal reunion based on whether the resident spouse is a NORP or foreign national is not contrary to the prohibition of discrimination laid down in LAW read in conjunction with LAW . In this respect , ORG referred to paragraphs CARDINAL of the judgment delivered by ORG DATE in ORG and NORP v. the GPE . Difference in treatment based on nationality must be seen , inter alia , in the light of the right of NORP nationals to settle in GPE , and no significance can be attributed to the fact that such discrimination is not considered contrary to LAW CARDINAL when assessing whether it is permissible to implement a scheme implying a difference in treatment between different groups of NORP nationals . In our opinion , no crucial significance can be attributed to paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the Abdulaziz , Cabales and NORP judgment either in this assessment , among other reasons because difference in treatment based on the length of a person \u2019s period of nationality is not comparable to a difference in treatment based on place of birth .", "In the cases in which the attachment requirement applies , some of the factors emphasised are whether the resident spouse has strong links to GPE by virtue of his or her childhood and schooling in GPE . Such strong attachment to GPE will exist in most cases where a person has held NORP nationality for DATE . However , when assessing whether the difference in treatment implied by the CARDINALyear rule can be considered objectively justified , it is not sufficient to compare persons not raised in GPE who acquire NORP nationality later in life with the large group of persons who were born NORP nationals and were also raised in GPE . If exemption from the attachment requirement was justified only by regard for the latter group of NORP nationals , the exemption should have been delimited differently . The crucial element must therefore be a comparison with persons who were born NORP nationals and have been NORP nationals for DATE , but who were not raised in GPE and may perhaps not at any time have had their residence in GPE . In our opinion , it can not be considered a fact that , from a general perspective , this group of NORP nationals has stronger ties with GPE than persons who have acquired NORP nationality after entering and residing in GPE for DATE . It should be taken into consideration in that connection that one of the general conditions for acquiring NORP nationality by naturalisation is that the relevant person has resided in GPE for DATE , has proved his or her proficiency in the NORP language and knowledge of NORP society and meets the requirement of self - support .", "Against that background , it is our opinion that the indirect difference in treatment implied by the DATE rule can not be considered objectively justified , and that it is therefore contrary to LAW .", "The consequence of this must be that , when applying section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW to NORP nationals , the authorities must limit the CARDINAL-year rule to being solely an age requirement , meaning that the attachment requirement does not apply in cases where the resident spouse is a NORP national and is DATE .", "Accordingly , we vote for ruling in favour of the [ applicants\u2019 ] claim to the effect that ORG must declare invalid the decision of CARDINAL DATE , thereby remitting the case for renewed consideration .", "In view of the outcome of the voting on this claim we see no reason to consider the claim for compensation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants remained in GPE and did not subsequently apply for family reunion in GPE , which they could have done under section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW , had the first applicant decided to reside in GPE anew .
