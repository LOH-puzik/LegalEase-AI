The applicant attended ORG from DATE . The school was owned , through trustees , by ORG of the Diocese of Cork and PERSON who was recognised by ORG and ORG ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) as the school \u2019s patron . The manager ( S. ) , acting on behalf of the bishop , was the local parish priest . The latter being elderly and infirm , a local priest ( \u00d3. ) was the de facto manager who acted on behalf of , and in the interests of , S. The term \u201c manager \u201d used below refers both to PERSON and to the management function he performed . ORG had CARDINAL teachers , CARDINAL of whom ( L.H. ) was the school \u2019s principal , a married man . PERSON was CARDINAL of CARDINAL national schools in the applicant \u2019s parish .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a parent of a child complained to the manager that ORG had sexually abused her child . That complaint was not reported to the police , to the ORG or to any other ORG authority and was not acted upon by the manager .", "CARDINAL . During DATE the applicant was subjected to CARDINAL sexual assaults by PERSON during music lessons in his classroom . During the time she attended those lessons , the applicant and her parents were unaware of the allegation made in DATE about ORG", "CARDINAL . In DATE other parents brought to the applicant \u2019s GPE attention similar allegations concerning PERSON Following a meeting of parents chaired by the manager about this , L.H. went on sick leave . In DATE he resigned from his post . Those allegations were not reported at that time to the police , to the ORG or to any other ORG authority . In a brief conversation , the applicant \u2019s mother asked her whether ORG had touched her . The applicant responded to the effect that something of a sexual nature had happened but she did not recall the conversation going any further . In DATE the manager notified the ORG that ORG had resigned and named his replacement . Soon thereafter PERSON took up a position in another national school where he taught until his retirement in DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the inspector assigned to the region visited ORG on CARDINAL occasions which was , as he later stated in evidence , an above average number of visits . He met with PERSON and PERSON He attended parent meetings on the question of ORG \u2019s amalgamation with other schools . No complaint about PERSON was made to him . He observed the teaching work of LOC and considered it satisfactory .", "CARDINAL . The applicant suppressed the sexual abuse . While she had significant psychological difficulties , she did not associate those with the abuse . In DATE she was contacted by the police who were investigating a complaint made in DATE by a former pupil of ORG against L.H. The applicant made a statement to the police in DATE and was referred for counselling . During the investigation a number of other pupils made statements . PERSON was charged with CARDINAL criminal offences of sexual abuse involving CARDINAL former pupils of the school during a period of DATE . In DATE he pleaded guilty to CARDINAL sample charges and was sentenced to imprisonment . His licence to teach was withdrawn by the Minister for Education ( \u201c the Minister \u201d ) under LAW of ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE Rules \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In or around DATE , and as a consequence of the evidence of other victims during the criminal trial and subsequent medical treatment , the applicant realised the connection between her psychological problems and the abuse by LAW and understood the extent of those problems .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant applied to the CICT for compensation . An initial award ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) was made by a single judge . The applicant appealed to a ORG panel . She claimed that the ORG gave her the option of continuing her appeal ( at the risk of finding that her LOC application would be rejected as out of time ) or of accepting the initial offer of the LOC with some additional expenses ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , the non - pecuniary aspect being LAW ) . The applicant accepted the offer by letter of DATE and gave the standard undertaking to repay the CICT award from any other award she may receive , from whatever source , in relation to the same injury . The award was made on an ex gratia basis . Since the ORG is never a party to LOC proceedings , it became aware of this award later before ORG ( see directly below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted a civil action against ORG and the Minister , as well as against GPE and the Attorney General , claiming damages for personal injuries suffered as a result of assault and battery including sexual abuse by PERSON Her claim against the latter CARDINAL defendants ( \u201c the State Defendants \u201d ) was threefold : ( a ) negligence by the ORG arising out of the failure of ORG in relation to the recognition , examination and supervision of the school and in failing to put in place appropriate measures and procedures to protect against , and put a stop to , the systematic abuse by ORG since DATE ; ( b ) vicarious liability of ORG for the acts of LAW since , inter alia , the true relationship between him and the ORG was CARDINAL of employment ; and ( c ) liability given the applicant \u2019s constitutional right to bodily integrity , the responsibility of ORG to provide primary education under LAW and the measures put in place to discharge that responsibility .", "CARDINAL . Since ORG did not file a defence , on DATE the applicant obtained judgment in default against him . On DATE ORG assessed and awarded damages payable by LAW in the sum of ORG CARDINAL , comprising ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in general damages , LAW in aggravated damages , LAW in exemplary damages , and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in special damages . The applicant took enforcement proceedings . PERSON claimed he had insufficient means and she obtained an instalment order of LAW per month . The first payment was received in DATE so that she has been paid in the region of ORG DATE . She registered a judgment mortgage against that part of the family home owned by ORG", "CARDINAL . As regards her case against ORG , she requested a Professor PERSON to advise her on the question of the adequacy of child - protection mechanisms in GPE in DATE . He responded by letter of DATE . Professor PERSON agreed that , if the child - protection protocols existing in DATE had been in place in DATE , it was very likely that the applicant \u2019s abuse would have been acted upon in a manner which would have ensured the promotion of her welfare . He feared that pleading the case on the basis of what the ORG should have known at the time would be unsuccessful because it would not be possible to project onto the past the knowledge and systems of accountability that existed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The High Court hearing against ORG began on DATE . On DATE , while the applicant was presenting her evidence , the High Court judge , in response to the applicant \u2019s complaint regarding the absence of a ORG system for adverting to and addressing sexual abuse in national schools , asked Counsel for the applicant as follows :", "\u201c What evidence do I have , or what should I have deduce[d ] from the evidence that has been given that either the system in operation was a bad system , and I will come back to that , or that there was an alternative system that should have been applied , and what that alternative system might have been . \u201d", "CARDINAL . When the applicant \u2019s case concluded , ORG applied for a direction to strike out the case on the basis that no prima facie case had been made out by the applicant as regards all CARDINAL grounds , submitting , inter alia , that there was no evidence of negligence . On DATE ORG accepted the GPE application , the court being \u201c satisfied that the plaintiff had not established a case in negligence against the [ State Defendants ] \u201d ( the \u201c non - suit \u201d order ) . The court did not and was not called upon to distinguish between the CARDINAL bases of the negligence claim . However , a prima facie case had been made out on the questions of vicarious and constitutional liability and evidence would be called from the defendants on those matters . The trial finished on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the High Court delivered judgment . It found that the action was not statute barred . It also concluded that the ORG was not vicariously liable for the sexual assaults perpetrated by ORG given the relationship between the ORG and the denominational management of national schools . Although counsel for the applicant had orally suggested that the ORG should be vicariously liable for the inaction of the manager , ORG judgment did not address this point . Finally , ORG found that no action lay for a breach of a constitutional right where existing laws ( in this case , tort ) protected that right . The costs of the proceedings against ORG were awarded against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . Her Notice of Appeal challenged the finding on vicarious liability and referred to CARDINAL matters : the absence of reasons for the interim ruling of DATE and the ORG judgment \u2019s failure to rule on the vicarious liability for the inaction of the manager . Mr Justice PERSON described the appeal as limited to the ORG \u2019s vicarious liability for the acts of ORG and the manager , although he commented in his judgment on the other CARDINAL initial claims of the applicant ( direct negligence and the constitutional claim ) . Mr Justice PERSON also considered that the appeal concerned only vicarious liability for the acts of L.H. , although he refused to accept that the ORG was vicariously liable for the manager .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was heard from DATE . By a majority judgment of DATE ( PERSON and PERSON , with whom Chief Justice PERSON and Mr Justice PERSON concurred and Mr Justice PERSON dissented ) , ORG dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . Hardiman J described in detail the legal status of national schools . While the arrangements for national - school education might \u201c seem rather odd DATE \u201d , they had to be understood in the context of NORP history in DATE . Following denominational conflict and the later concession of NORP emancipation in DATE , the dissenting churches and ORG wished to ensure that children of their denominations be educated in schools controlled by the denomination and not by the ORG or the established ( NORP ) Church . Those churches were \u201c remarkably successful \u201d in achieving this aim : from the very beginning of the NORP system of national education ( encapsulated in the \u201c PERSON letter \u201d of DATE ) , ORG authorities paid for the system of national education \u201c but did not manage it or administer it at the point of delivery \u201d . The latter function was left to the local denominational manager . While ORG funding was accorded on a proportionate basis to all denominational schools , the population was at the time overwhelmingly NORP so that the majority of national schools had NORP patrons and managers .", "CARDINAL . Hardiman J went on to describe as \u201c remarkable \u201d the fact that , whilst in DATE LOC firmer distinctions were being drawn between ORG and ORG and ORG influence in the provision of public services ( including education ) was ebbing , in GPE the position of the ORG became stronger and more entrenched . He adopted the evidence of CARDINAL expert witness ( in the history of education in GPE ) who described the position after the inception of ORG in DATE and noted that the NORP managers in this \u201c managerial \u201d system", "\u201c were very clearly articulate and very absolutely ... precise in how they interpreted what the situation was for national schools in the new GPE ... It had to be NORP schools under NORP management , NORP teachers , NORP children \u201d .", "CARDINAL . That expert witness went on to describe the answer of ORG in DATE to a request by a ORG trade union to have local committees deal with maintaining and repairing school buildings . ORG had responded that there could be no interference whatever with the \u201c inherited tradition of managerial rights of schooling \u201d . The limited proposal of the union was considered to be the thin edge of the wedge because , in due course , the request might be to interfere with \u201c other aspects of the manager \u2019s authority vis - \u00e0 - vis the appointment and dismissal of teachers which was of course the key concern that had been fought for and won over the years \u201d . PERSON referred to the \u201c urgent desire \u201d of the denominations to maintain their role in primary education .", "CARDINAL . As PERSON explained , the LAW reflected this managerial structure : the obligation in LAW ) on the ORG to \u201c provide for \u201d free primary education reflected a largely ORG - funded , but entirely clerically administered , system of education . As a result there were CARDINAL national schools in GPE : most were under the control of NORP patrons and managers , a few were under the control of other denominations and even fewer were controlled by non - denominational groups .", "CARDINAL . Hardiman J noted that , in recent times and after DATE , the provision of education was belatedly and at least partially placed on a statutory basis by LAW ; prior to that LAW the system had been administered by LAW as well as by other ministerial letters , circulars and notes .", "CARDINAL . As to what could be gleaned from DATE , PERSON noted :", "\u201c The Minister laid down rules for national schools but they were general in nature and did not allow him to govern the detailed activities of any individual teacher . He inspected the schools for their academic performance , other than religious instruction , but it did not go further than that . He was ... deprived of the direct control of the schools , and of the enormous power which that brings , because \u2018 there was interposed between the ORG and the child the manager or the committee or board of management\u2019 . Equally , the Minister did not appoint the manager or the teacher or directly supervise him . This , indeed , was the essence of the \u2018 managerial system\u2019 . I can not see , on the evidence , that he had any scope whatever to make a personal judgment about either of these CARDINAL individuals . Moreover , it seems to have been instinctively recognised by the parents who complained about the first defendant that the person with direct authority to receive the complaint and do something about it was the clerical and clerically appointed manager . No complaint , on the evidence , was directed to the Minister or to any State body . The matter was handled , so to speak , \u2018 in house\u2019 at the election of the complainants . The end result of the process was a voluntary resignation followed by the employment of [ L.H. ] in another school in the vicinity .", "All these factors tending to distance the Minister and the ORG authorities from the management of the school and the control of the first defendant are direct consequences of the long established system of education , described above and mandated in the LAW whereby the Minister pays and , to a certain extent , regulates , but the schools and the teachers are controlled by their clerical managers and patrons . It is not the concern of the ORG either to endorse or to criticise that system but merely to register its existence and the obvious fact that it deprives the Minister and the ORG of direct control of schools , teachers , and pupils . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Hardiman J observed that the sexual abuse of a pupil was the negation of what ORG was employed to do but he also found that in DATE it \u201c was an unusual act , little discussed , and certainly not regarded as an ordinary foreseeable risk of attending at a school \u201d . He considered it \u201c notable \u201d that she did not sue the patron , the diocese of which he was bishop , his successors or his estate , the trustees of the property of the Diocese of Cork and PERSON ( owners of the school ) , the manager or his estate or successors .", "CARDINAL . Hardiman J concluded that , having regard to the relevant test for vicarious liability and to the above - described arrangements for the control and management of national schools , ORG were not liable to the applicant for the wrongs committed against her . In particular , even applying the wider form of vicarious liability invoked , the Minister \u2019s absence of direct control over LAW , long since ceded to the manager and the patron , prevented a finding against the Minister . The relationship of LOC and the State \u2013 a \u201c triangular one with the NORP \u201d DATE was entirely sui generis and a product of GPE \u2019s unique historical experience . The manager was", "\u201c the nominee of the patron , that is of a power other than the Minister and he did not inform the Minister of any difficulties with , or complaints about , [ L.H. ] or of his resignation and appointment to teach elsewhere until they were faits accomplis . He was the agent not of the Minister , but of ORG , the power in whose interest the Minister was displaced from the management of the school \u201d .", "CARDINAL . PERSON commented on CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s original claims which had \u201c not been proceeded with \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As to the claim of negligence by the ORG , he remarked", "\u201c ... this is a claim which could more appropriately be made against the manager . It was he who had the power to put in place appropriate measures and procedures governing the running of the school . The Minister can hardly be responsible for a failure to \u2018 ORG a course of action of whose existence he was quite unaware \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As to the claim about the responsibility of the ORG in the provision of primary education under LAW and the measures put in place to discharge that responsibility , PERSON stated :", "\u201c I have already analysed the terms of LAW from which it will be seen that the Minister , in the case of this national school , was simply providing assistance and subvention to private and corporate ( i.e. NORP ) endeavour , leaving the running of the school to the private or corporate entities . The Minister is thereby , as PERSON pointed out in PERSON v. GPE [ DATE ] ORG , deprived of the control of education by the interposing of the patron and the manager between him and the children . These persons , and particularly the latter , are in much closer and more frequent contact with the school than the Minister or ORG .", "I do not read the provisions of LAW as requiring more than that the Minister shall \u2018 endeavour to supplement and give reasonable aid to private and corporate educational initiative\u2019 , to \u2018 provide for free primary education\u2019 . ... In my view the LAW specifically envisages , not indeed a delegation but a ceding of the actual running of schools to the interests represented by the patron and the manager . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Hardiman J concluded by pointing out that nothing in the judgment could be interpreted as suggesting liability on the part of the ORG and , in any event , it was quite impossible to do so because those authorities had not been heard by ORG since the applicant had not sued them .", "CARDINAL . Fennelly J , who delivered the other majority judgment , began by noting that the \u201c calamity of the exploitation of authority over children so as to abuse them sexually \u201d had shaken society to its foundations . Cases of sexual abuse had preoccupied the criminal courts and ORG for DATE and it was surprising that that court was confronted for the first time with questions relating to the liability of institutions including the ORG for sexual abuse of schoolchildren in a national school by a teacher .", "CARDINAL . Fennelly J also described in some detail the history and consequent legal status of national schools , which system had survived independence in DATE and the enactment of the LAW in DATE . He accepted the expert \u2019s evidence that it was not a ORG system but rather a \u201c ORG - supported system \u201d . He noted the clear division of power between the ORG ( funding and fixing the curriculum ) and the manager ( day - to - DATE running of the school including hiring and firing teachers ) , noting that the different religions were determined to preserve and guard their own distinct religious education so that national schools developed on a denominational basis .", "CARDINAL . He considered inspectors to be a crucially important part of the system of ORG oversight and maintenance of standards which enabled the Minister to be satisfied about the quality of the system . However , he noted that the inspection regime did not alter the division of responsibilities between the ORG and the manager , the inspectors having no power to direct teachers in the carrying out of their duties . The DATE Rules reflected this allocation of responsibilities between the ORG and ORG authorities . Even if , in modern times , the ORG played a more intrusive role , responsibility for DATE management remained with the manager . He concluded that the ORG was not vicariously liable for the acts of L.H. or , for the same reasons , for the failure of the manager to report the DATE complaint to the ORG . ORG was not employed by the ORG but , in law , by the manager . While ORG had to have the qualifications laid down by the Minister and had to observe the DATE Rules and while the ORG had disciplinary powers in those respects , ORG was not engaged by the ORG and the ORG could not dismiss him .", "CARDINAL . Referring back to the reference in the Notice of Appeal to the ORG \u2019s liability for the failure of the manager to report the DATE complaint , ORG concluded that \u201c [ CARDINAL the same reason , insofar as it is necessary to say so , there can be no liability for the failure of [ the manager ] to report the DATE complaint . [ The manager ] was not the employee of the second defendant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON dissented . He accepted that neither the ORG nor its inspectors had any knowledge of the assaults . He noted that , for all practical purposes , most primary education in GPE took the form of a joint enterprise between ORG and he considered that that relationship was such that there was a sufficient connection between the ORG and the creation of the risk as to render the ORG liable . PERSON relied , notably , on the role of school inspectors . He examined in some detail the evidence given by , and concerning the role of , school inspectors noting , inter alia , that if an allegation of sexual assault by a teacher on a national - school pupil was considered well - founded by an inquiry set up by ORG , it could lead to the withdrawal of recognition or to a police investigation and , if the police found the complaint justified , to the withdrawal of the teacher \u2019s licence to teach .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG vacated the ORG order for costs against the applicant since it was not disputed that hers was an important and complex test case . It determined that each party had to bear its own costs related to the action against ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was legally represented throughout the civil proceedings , although she did not have legal aid ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
