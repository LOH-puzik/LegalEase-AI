On DATE the applicant , who was serving in ORG at the time , was involved in a quarrel in the GPE military barracks in GPE with CARDINAL other recruits , Mr GPE and Mr GPE The quarrel was witnessed by a number of other soldiers . At some point during the quarrel the applicant said to GPE and GPE :", "\u201c I fuck your baptised mother ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . It would appear that shortly afterwards corporal PERSON summoned the applicant through a duty officer to report to him concerning the incident . As the applicant refused to do so , corporal PERSON went to look for him and , after having found him , asked why he had not reported to him as instructed . The applicant replied :", "\u201c This is not my ORG , I am not its national , I do n\u2019t recognise [ respect ] you , your rank or ORG ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant repeated this statement in the presence of other officers during a subsequent conversation with the battalion commander , first lieutenant ORG Asked whether he intended to offend someone \u2019s religion and ethnic origin he replied :", "\u201c Yes !

On DATE the GPE State Attorney \u2019s ORG ( GPE dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo u PERSON ) indicted the applicant before ORG ( PERSON ) , accusing him of the criminal offence of tarnishing the reputation of GPE , defined in LAW .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on DATE the applicant admitted making the above statements , expressed remorse and stated that he considered himself a national of GPE , that he recognised it as his ORG , and therefore that he also recognised its ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG delivered a judgment whereby it found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c The [ value ] protected by [ proscribing ] this criminal offence is the reputation of GPE [ and ] its dignity , symbolised in the objects [ listed in the definition of the offence ] . The acts described [ therein ] , that is , exposure to ridicule , contempt and severe disdain , indicate that the law [ LAW ] requires grave denigration , malice , hatred and demonstrative disrespect for those values and symbols , such that they would lose their dignity in the eyes of citizens and the world .", "...", "The [ court ] finds it proven ... that the accused committed the criminal offence defined in LAW because he publicly exposed GPE and the NORP people to contempt and severe disdain by saying publicly , ... , in the presence of a large number of people that ... this State ( GPE ) was not his ORG , that he did not recognise it , that he was not its national , that he did not recognise ORG \u2013 which is , parenthetically , the foundation of the constitutional integrity and territorial existence of any legally organised state such as GPE \u2013 that he did not recognise the legitimacy of his superior officer in ORG ... and his rank , which [ statements ] were accompanied by [ further statements ] which offend religious and national affiliation , such as those in which he said that he fucks their baptised mothers , PERSON mothers and that they all ( NORP , NORP people ) originated from NORP . Those [ statements ] indicate severe denigration , malice , hatred and demonstrative disrespect for the values and symbols [ listed in the definition of the offence ] , whereby those values and symbols of GPE , by being treated in such a way in front of citizens ( members of ORG ) , lost their dignity .", "[ When deciding on a penalty , the court takes into account ] the fact that the accused admitted committing the offence , the fact that he [ does not have a criminal record ] , his young age and correct conduct before the court , whereas , as an aggravating circumstance , it takes into account the manner in which the offence was committed , that is , a high level of perseverance and contempt in making the offending statements .", "Taking into account all the above circumstances ... [ the court ] sentences the accused to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , considering that the purpose of the punishment may , given the type and gravity of the criminal offence , be achieved only by a prison sentence . This prison sentence will , in the opinion of [ this court ] , primarily achieve the purpose of individual prevention , so that the accused will not commit this or a similar offence [ in the future ] . [ It will also meet ] the purpose of general prevention by deterring others from committing this or similar offences . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He argued that his statements could have been qualified as the criminal offence of insult against recruits GPE and GPE and/or a disciplinary offence of disobedience to his superior officers , rather than the criminal offence of tarnishing the reputation of GPE . Furthermore , his conviction for that criminal offence interfered with his freedom of expression because he had been entitled to express his opinion that NORP had originated from NORP who had converted to NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) upheld the first - instance judgment in part and reversed it in part . It upheld the lower court \u2019s finding that the applicant was guilty of the offence in question . However , it overturned the sentence imposed and replaced it with a suspended sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment with a DATE probation period . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c The argument of the accused that ... the operative part of the contested judgment is incomprehensible and self - contradictory because the facts [ of the case ] do not correspond to the legal definition of the criminal offence [ for which he has been convicted ] is unfounded . In explaining this argument , the accused ... claims that cursing GPE and GPE \u2019s baptised mothers constitutes the criminal offence of insult defined in LAW , that by stating that he did not recognise ORG , ORG and its officers [ he had only ] exposed himself to ridicule and contempt and not GPE , its ORG or its officers , and that by saying that all NORP had originated from NORP he [ was merely expressing ] CARDINAL possible theory on the ethnogenesis of NORP , which [ he ] has the right to [ do ] on the basis of LAW , which , in [ its ] LAW , guarantees the freedom of thought and freedom of expression .", "Contrary to the foregoing , nothing in the appeal of the accused suggests that the operative part of the contested judgment is incomprehensible or contradictory , as the appellant argues ...", "...", "The first - instance court ... did not give sufficient weight to mitigating circumstances , that is , to the fact that the accused [ does not have a criminal record ] , to his young age and correct conduct before the court , which was also demonstrated by his admission that he committed the ... offence and ... clearly expressed remorse for doing so , which suggests that the criminal offence perpetrated by the accused is a result of the impudence of youngsters . ORG ... therefore considers that in this particular case the purpose of the punishment may be achieved without imposing a prison sentence . For these reasons , the appeal of the accused has to be allowed in part [ as regards ] the penalty [ imposed ] and the first - instance judgment [ must accordingly be ] reversed ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant subsequently lodged a constitutional complaint alleging , inter alia , a violation of his freedom of expression , guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) declared the applicant \u2019s complaint inadmissible . It found that even though the applicant relied on the relevant Articles of the LAW in his constitutional complaint , he had not substantiated his complaint by any constitutional - law arguments but had merely repeated the arguments raised in the proceedings before the ordinary courts .
