It considered that it was necessary to place the applicant in a solitary cell designated for such detainees at a special high - security prison ward because he had been charged with serious offences committed in an organised criminal group .

Every DATE the Gda\u0144sk Remand ORG Penitentiary Commission ( PERSON ) reviewed its decision on the classification of the applicant as a \u201c dangerous detainee \u201d . The applicant appealed against many of those decisions . He submitted that the offences with which he had been charged , in particular drug - smuggling , did not justify the imposition of the special regime . He argued that the measure had been extended automatically without any consideration for his health and mental well - being , that it had in fact been imposed for an unlimited duration and was putting an exceptionally severe strain on him and his family . He also complained about being subjected to a strip search every time he left and entered the cell .", "All the appeals were dismissed .", "CARDINAL .

In that regard , it stressed that the applicant had been charged in CARDINAL separate sets of criminal proceedings conducted by different courts or prosecutors and those other charges included , among other things , the leading of an organised and armed criminal group , kidnapping , armed robbery and arms trafficking . The nature of the charges and the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances , such as his previous criminal record , leadership qualities and tendency to dominate the others fully supported the view that there existed the \u201c danger [ to society and the security of a remand centre ] \u201d referred to in LAW . In sum , there was no indication that the contested decision was contrary to the law , which was the sole ground on which it could be challenged and possibly quashed . As regards the applicant \u2019s argument that his contacts with his family were severely restricted as a result of his \u201c dangerous detainee \u201d status , the court held that those restrictions were lawful as being applied under the relevant provisions of LAW and did not make it impossible for him to maintain such contacts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE the ORG , relying on the same grounds , rejected further appeals against ORG decisions prolonging the imposition of the \u201c dangerous detainee \u201d regime on the applicant .

He also complained that the routine strip - searches , to which he had been subjected , sometimes several times a day , were intrusive , unnecessary and humiliating .", "CARDINAL .

In these circumstances , the special regime had to be continued .", "On DATE ORG upheld another decision of ORG , relying on the applicant \u2019s criminal convictions and stressing that under the applicable legal provisions no timelimit was set for the imposition of the regime .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . Noting that the decision was based on the fact that the applicant , in view of his personal circumstances and serious lack of moral character , posed a serious danger to prison security and order , as well as to prison ORG safety , the court found that this assessment had been objective and fully justified the continuation of the regime .", "CARDINAL .

Solitary confinement or small - group isolation for extended periods is more likely to de - socialise than re - socialise people .
