ORG , having been informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW CARDINAL of the Rules of Court ) , indicated that they did not wish to exercise that right .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was an officer of the JNA , the armed forces of the former ORG ( \u201c SFRY \u201d ) . The present case concerns his attempt to regain possession of a flat he had bought in GPE before the DATE - CARDINAL war .", "CARDINAL . The detailed background concerning socially owned flats , military flats and the involvement of foreign armed forces in the DATE - CARDINAL war in GPE is provided in GPE v. GPE ( no .

The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was granted the right to occupy a military flat in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he bought that flat under the terms of the Military Flats Act DATE and paid the full purchase price in the amount of MONEY ( MONEY at the time ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the restitution commission set up by Annex CARDINAL to the DATE LAW in GPE ( \u201c the GPE Peace Agreement \u201d ) , before which the applicant pursued parallel proceedings , held that the applicant was neither a refugee nor a displaced person within the meaning of Annex CARDINAL , and declined jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an application with ORG ( a domestic human - rights body set up under PERSON DATE to ORG ) . He relied on Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and Article CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( which had succeeded ORG in DATE ) found a violation of LAW on account of the length of the restitution proceedings and awarded the applicant MONEY ( BAM ; MONEY ( ORG ) ) for non - pecuniary damage in this connection . As regards the complaint under LAW No . CARDINAL , ORG held that the situation complained of , that is , the applicant \u2019s inability to regain possession of the flat and to register his title to it , undoubtedly amounted to a continuing interference with the peaceful enjoyment of his \u201c possessions \u201d . Assessing the proportionality of the interference , ORG held that the applicant \u2019s continued service in the VJ forces after the DATE - CARDINAL war demonstrated his disloyalty to GPE . Taking into consideration also the serious shortage of housing units and the compensation to which the applicant was entitled , ORG concluded that the interference was justified . It therefore found no violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention and considered it to be unnecessary to examine the discrimination and LAW complaints . However , it ordered the government of ORG to secure the applicant \u2019s right to compensation for his flat under section DATE of ORG without further delay and at the latest within DATE of the delivery of that decision .", "CARDINAL .

Nevertheless , CARDINAL categories of buyers are not entitled to repossess their flats and to register their title to them ( section ORG and section CARDINAL of ORG . The first category concerns those who served in foreign armed forces after the DATE - CARDINAL war . The second concerns those who acquired occupancy or equivalent rights to a military flat in a successor ORG of the SFRY . However , they are entitled to compensation under section ORG . The compensation was initially calculated on the basis of approximately ORG QUANTITY , adjusted in line with the age of the flat , with depreciation set at PERCENT of its value per year . On DATE section DATE of ORG was amended so that those who could not repossess their flats were entitled only to a refund of the amount paid for the flats in DATE , plus interest at the rate applicable to overnight deposits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of GPE v. GPE and GPE , cited above , ORG ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) declared that section DATE as amended in DATE was unconstitutional and ordered ORG to amend it ( decision no . U CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG stated , in particular :", "\u201c ORG can not determine what the compensation [ for military flats ] should be . That question is within the jurisdiction of ORG , which in its role of a legislative body will determine the policy concerning this matter . However , ORG believes that in determining this matter the legislator should take into account the circumstances in which the impugned flats were purchased , the economic situation in GPE and the fact that LAW No . CARDINAL of ORG does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE and DATE ORG adopted action plans in response to the ORG \u2019s judgments in the cases of GPE and PERSON and Others ( both cited above ) with a view to identifying similar cases and introducing an adequate compensation scheme . It was established that CARDINAL individuals were in the same situation as the applicants in those cases ( out of which CARDINAL had purchased their flats ) . It was further estimated that around ORG CARDINAL million should be secured to pay the compensation for their pre - war homes .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government of ORG prepared draft amendments to section DATE of ORG . The amendments provide that the amount actually paid for the flats in DATE , plus interest at the rate applicable to overnight deposits , will be refunded to those who acquired a tenancy right or another equivalent right to a military flat in one of the successor ORG . Those who did not acquire such rights , irrespective of whether they purchased or had an occupancy right in respect of the flats , will be entitled to compensation calculated at a rate of approximately ORG QUANTITY , adjusted in line with the age of the flat , with depreciation set at PERCENT of its value per year . As explained above , the same method was used before the DATE legislative amendments ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .
