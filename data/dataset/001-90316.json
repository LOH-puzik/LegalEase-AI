It was represented before the Court by Dr T. PERSON and Dr PERSON , lawyers practising in PERSON .

The land is situated in an area where both commercial and residential properties are to be found . It adjoins on one side a public main road . However , the land in question is currently situated outside development zones and its development is subject to strict limitations .", "By a declaration published in ORG of DATE , under ORG ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , LAW of LAW , it was stated that a portion of the land measuring MONEY was to be directly expropriated by the ORG by way of outright purchase . The declaration did not state the aim of the expropriation but only the sum offered as compensation , CARDINAL NORP Liras ( MTL \u2013 approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "According to the information provided by the applicant company on DATE , by that date the sum offered in compensation had not been deposited . Consequently , according to law ( see relevant domestic law ) , it was prohibited from commencing proceedings before ORG ( \u201c LAB \u201d ) , the competent authority , to assess the amount of compensation payable .", "According to the ORG and as evidenced by the documents submitted , the amount of compensation was deposited in an interest - bearing bank account on DATE , DATE after the official declaration . By a letter of DATE the applicant company was informed of the said acquisition . However , the applicant company did not take steps to prove its ownership or to withdraw the said compensation . In DATE the amount of compensation plus interest stood at MTL CARDINAL , CARDINAL ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) , an amount which the applicant could freely withdraw . This procedure is still open to the applicant company .", "On an unspecified date the applicant company instituted proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) asking it to declare that the expropriation was in violation of its rights under LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . It claimed that the expropriation had not been effected for a public purpose since the land was to be used for the building of stables for the commercial use of other private persons . Moreover , the applicant company had been made to suffer an excessive burden , since the land in question offered the only means of access to the rest of its land . Consequently , the expropriation had not been proportionate vis - a - vis the aims pursued .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s claims . It held that the expropriation had been needed for a public purpose , namely the redevelopment of slum housing and the construction of a new system of flood relief . The fair balance principle had been maintained since construction for social housing was in the public interest and it had not been proved that an alternative area of land in the vicinity could be used .", "On an unspecified date the applicant company appealed , claiming that the project could have been restructured differently in order to limit the individual and excessive burden suffered by the applicant company and that the taking had been necessary solely for the benefit of third parties .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s appeal . It held that slum clearance was a social housing project which fell within the definition of public interest . The residents of the slum area kept animals for commercial purposes and it was thus understandable that the new redeveloped area would provide stables and that for public health reasons it had been subsequently decided to locate the stables on the periphery of the residential area . As indicated by the court of first instance , it had not been proved that there was other land which could have been used for this purpose . It was not correct to say that more land had been taken than was necessary , or that the land expropriated blocked access to the remainder of the land owned by the applicant company . Moreover , the applicant company would have received compensation for the land expropriated and the adequacy of the compensation had not been contested . Thus , it could not be said that the applicant company had been made to bear a disproportionate burden .", "The relevant sections of ORG ) Ordinance ( LAW of LAW ) , read as follows :", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c The President of GPE may by declaration signed by him declare any land to be required for a public purpose . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c No person shall require any proof of the public purpose referred to in articles CARDINAL and DATE and in article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) other than the declaration of the President of GPE . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Whenever the President of GPE declares that any land is required for a public purpose , the competent authority shall cause a copy of such declaration , ... to be published in ORG ... \u201d", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If the competent authority and the owner agree on the amount of compensation for any land , ORG , on the application of either of the parties , shall make an order putting the agreement into effect ...", "( CARDINAL ) Within DATE from the publication of LAW as referred to in sub - article ( CARDINAL ) in the ORG , the Government shall deposit in an interest - bearing bank account ( which will guarantee a minimum of interest per annum as the Minister responsible for lands may by regulation under this sub - article prescribe ) a sum equal to the amount of compensation offered in LAW ...", "...", "( CARDINAL ) Where the person entitled to compensation does not accept that the amount deposited is adequate , such person may apply to ORG for the determination of the compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance ...", "( CARDINAL ) Such application shall be filed with ORG within DATE from the date of notification of the judicial act by the competent authority ...
