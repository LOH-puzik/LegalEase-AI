Following a number of remittals of the case against the applicant and CARDINAL other co - defendants , on DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) convicted the applicant of several criminal charges committed in collusion with the co - defendants .

As regards the other criminal offences , ORG found each co - defendant guilty as charged . ORG sentenced the applicant to a cumulative sentence of life imprisonment .

On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . Although he admitted having committed the criminal offences , he challenged the penalty imposed . He argued that the trial court had failed to take account of some mitigating factors in his favour such as the remorse he had shown after committing the crime and his surrender to the authorities , his family \u2019s difficult financial situation and the fact that he had a minor child , the lack of any previous criminal records and his low educational level .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG sentenced the applicant to a cumulative term of DATE imprisonment , reduced by CARDINAL as a result of the use of the summary procedure . The relevant parts of the judgment read as follows .", "\u201c ... ORG [ of Appeal ] considers that ORG characterised the criminal offences correctly , but the sentence [ of imprisonment ] should be changed in the light of large differences in the penalties imposed on each defendant . All the co - defendants are almost in the same position as far as their collusion is concerned and their respective role in the commission of the offences . Despite the fact that the defendant was the perpetrator of CARDINAL of the offences , there should not be such a large difference in the sentences imposed . Having regard to LAW which aims at excluding the application of life imprisonment , having regard to the remorse shown by the defendant during the proceedings , his surrender to the authorities following the commission of the crime , and his role as the perpetrator in the commission of the criminal offence , the court considers that he should be ... cumulatively sentenced to PERCENT imprisonment . In these circumstances , having regard to the appeal lodged by the applicant , the ORG decision should be amended in so far as the sentence imposed on the defendant is concerned . \u201d", "The relevant provisions of the operative part of the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c ...", "Pursuant to LAW the accused PERSON is cumulatively sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "Pursuant to LAW of the sentence imposed on PERSON is reduced . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

He stated , inter alia , that the penalty imposed by ORG , which had not ordered life imprisonment for the applicant for being the perpetrator of a crime that had resulted in the death of a person , did not correspond to the serious danger to society posed by the applicant and the serious criminal consequences of that offence .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that the applicant did not make any written submissions to ORG in response to the prosecutor \u2019s appeal .

At the hearing of DATE before ORG , the applicant was represented by ORG , who requested the court to dismiss the prosecutor \u2019s appeal .

The relevant parts of ORG judgment read :", "\u201c ORG , having examined the documents in the investigation file and the court file , having examined the grounds of appeal lodged by the prosecutor , considers that ORG judgment , which amended the ORG judgment by changing the defendant \u2019s [ the applicant \u2019s ] conviction , was taken on the basis of an erroneous application of the criminal law , particularly Article CARDINAL et seq . of LAW , which determine the manner of imposing a sentence .", "ORG draws this conclusion because ORG did not duly consider the severity of the criminal offences committed by the accused , the serious danger to society that the accused poses by continuing to commit criminal offences , the serious degree of guilt , the grave criminal consequences , and the commission of the criminal offence on CARDINAL occasion , using weapons and acting in collusion with others .", "The reduction of the sentence by ORG on the ground that the accused assisted justice by showing remorse for the offences he had committed and by requesting the use of the summary procedure , is not founded in law . The acceptance of the charges by the accused and his request for the use of the summary procedure assist the speedy rendering of justice . The law takes this into account by reducing the penalty by CARDINAL in accordance with LAW ORG . A further reduction of the defendant \u2019s sentence , beyond the reduction entitled to by virtue of the application of LAW ORG , has resulted in a double reduction of the sentence for the same circumstances . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
