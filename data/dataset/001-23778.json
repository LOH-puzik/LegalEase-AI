{"ITEMID": "001-23778", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "NASIMI v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national of NORP origin who was born in DATE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "DATE the applicant applied CARDINAL times for a visa to visit his sister in GPE . In connection with these applications his sister stated on CARDINAL occasions that the applicant was \u201c non - political \u201d and had no political problems . The applicant was finally granted a visa in DATE and stayed with his sister in GPE for DATE .", "In DATE the applicant was once again granted a visa and came to visit his sister . He arrived in GPE on DATE , holding a valid NORP passport . He applied for asylum on DATE .", "In interviews held on CARDINAL and DATE the applicant stated that , on DATE , the NORP authorities had discovered copies of DATE a DATE political journal written in the NORP language which was forbidden in GPE \u2013 in his home and were searching for him . He had forgotten about the copies as a relative had fallen seriously ill at the time when he was about to leave for GPE . As a consequence , the applicant 's wife and children DATE a daughter born in DATE and a son born in DATE had been interrogated . His wife had been detained but later released on bail . The applicant further claimed that he had been , and still was , active in GPE , a political organisation , distributing journals and other documents . Allegedly , his family were well - known supporters of GPE and his brother and brother - in - law had been executed by the NORP authorities due to their political activities . The applicant had been imprisoned in DATE . He had also been dismissed from his job as a teacher . He had thereafter continued with his political activities \u2013 being officially active for the organisation as from DATE and had been beaten up on some occasions when he reported to the authorities in compliance with a reporting duty . On several occasions he had also been interrogated and his house had been searched . He claimed to be a NORP and knowledgeable about the ideas of PERSON and PERSON , although he had not read anything by them and was not familiar with their views on religion .", "In a letter to ORG of DATE counsel for the applicant added that the applicant had been tortured and assaulted while he was imprisoned .", "On DATE the applicant 's wife and children left GPE . Upon arrival in GPE , apparently on DATE , they applied for asylum . The wife first stated that her identification papers had been confiscated when the NORP authorities searched the family 's home . Later she admitted that she had first travelled to GPE with a valid visa to visit her sister and that she had destroyed her passport herself . The applicant 's daughter claimed that she had been relegated from school due to the authorities ' allegations against her father .", "On DATE ORG ( Migrationsverket ) rejected the asylum applications and ordered that the family be expelled to GPE . ORG noted that the applicant had received a passport in DATE and had been allowed to leave GPE legally on CARDINAL occasions . It found it improbable that this would have happened if the authorities had suspected him of being politically active against ORG . ORG also found it unlikely that the applicant had left subversive journals in his home and had not remembered them and told relatives to get rid of them while he was in GPE . Further , ORG considered that the applicant 's wife and children would not have been allowed to leave GPE legally if the wife , as claimed , had been interrogated and detained and eventually released on bail . In conclusion , the ORG called into question substantial parts of the information given in the cases and considered that the applicant and his wife had not shown that they were of a particular interest to the NORP authorities or that the family members would be subjected to persecution or discrimination .", "On DATE the applicant and his wife appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) . The applicant submitted that he had obtained a passport by bribing officials with a colour television .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , as their lawyer had failed to show that she was authorised to lodge the appeal on behalf of the family .", "Later the family lodged a new application with ORG . They claimed that also the wife 's uncle had been executed by the NORP regime . Furthermore , the NORP authorities allegedly suspected that the applicant had joined the armed struggle in the NORP part of GPE . He submitted a certificate from \u201c GPE abroad \u201d in which it was stated that he had been an active supporter of GPE and that he had been imprisoned for DATE in DATE because of his activities . The applicant also claimed that the torture to which he had been subjected had injured him physically and mentally for life . He submitted , inter alia , a certificate of DATE issued by PERSON , a qualified psychologist and psychotherapist , who stated that the applicant was suicidal , seriously depressed and showed clear signs of suffering from a post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . It was therefore important that he undergo long - term psychotherapy and medical treatment . According to medical records invoked by the applicant before ORG and ORG , the applicant had visited the health care centre in PERSON CARDINAL times DATE and the health care centre in S\u00e4ffle CARDINAL times DATE for various afflictions . On CARDINAL occasions he had mentioned that he had problems due to previous torture .", "On DATE ORG rejected the new application . It did not find that the new submissions indicated that the applicants were in need of protection in GPE . As regards the applicant 's health , ORG did not find that the medical information showed that he suffered from such a serious physical or mental injury that a residence permit should be granted on humanitarian grounds .", "In DATE a third application for residence permits was made . In a new certificate , dated DATE and submitted to ORG , ORG stated that the applicant 's health had deteriorated , that he and his daughter were seriously suicidal and that also the other family members had mental problems . In support of the application , the applicant also submitted an NORP document , purportedly a summons to appear before the revolutionary court in GPE , his hometown , issued on DATE . Allegedly , it had not been submitted earlier as mail was very often opened in GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the third application . It found that the explanation why the court notice had not been handed in earlier was unsatisfactory . As the applicant 's wife and children had not left GPE until DATE they should have been able to bring it with them . It was further unlikely that they had been allowed to leave the country if the authorities ' had had such an interest in the applicant . As regards the statements made by PERSON , ORG , questioning their objectivity , found it remarkable that she had drawn far - reaching medical conclusions about the family members ' health and had assessed the availability of medical treatment in GPE and the family 's need of protection in GPE . In any event , the ORG considered that it had not been shown that any member of the family suffered from such a serious mental disturbance or similar state of health that they could not be considered responsible for their own actions . It was therefore not inhuman to enforce the expulsion decision .", "On DATE the family lodged yet another application for residence permits . In support thereof , they invoked CARDINAL further statements concerning their health , CARDINAL issued on DATE by PERSON , a qualified physician and psychotherapist and specialist in psychiatry , and one issued on DATE by PERSON , a qualified physician . PERSON stated that the applicant and his wife showed clear symptoms of GPE , that the applicant was seriously suicidal and that the children suffered from depression . PERSON , who had only examined the applicant , stated that he met almost all the criteria for a post - traumatic stress syndrome and that there was a serious risk that he would commit suicide in the event of his being expelled to GPE . The applicant further claimed that he had taken part in CARDINAL demonstrations in GPE for an NORP communist party . The second one , which had taken place DATE before the lodging of the latest application , had been shown on NORP television and had attracted the attention of the NORP security police which had interrogated the applicant 's mother in GPE about the applicant and his involvement in the demonstration .", "On DATE ORG decided not to suspend the enforcement of the expulsion order .", "By a decision of DATE , following the ORG 's indication under LAW , ORG stayed the enforcement of the expulsion order .", "The latest application for residence permits is still pending before ORG .", "The applicant has submitted that his mental health has deteriorated since DATE . It appears , however , that he has not undergone the treatment prescribed by Dr Lindqvist in DATE . According to a medical certificate of DATE by PERSON , specialist in general psychiatry , the applicant , while not having suicidal thoughts , had expressed that he would rather die than return to GPE and had shown symptoms of suffering from GPE and depression . Also his children were suffering from mental problems . PERSON stated that the applicant was in need of long - term psychiatric care and started a treatment with antidepressants ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
