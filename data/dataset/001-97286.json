She is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s son , PERSON ( \u201c JS \u201d ) born on DATE , hanged himself while in detention at ORG ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) on DATE . This application concerns issues relating to his death .", "By DATE three social services investigations had been carried out into allegations of ill - treatment of JS ( then DATE ) , concluding that the allegations were unfounded . During the third , concerns were raised about JS\u2019 mental health . From DATE he was treated for depression and the relevant child services reported his behaviour as unpredictable and aggressive . During DATE his behaviour continued to degenerate and in DATE he was referred to a psychiatrist ( Dr F , a specialist in child and adolescent psychiatry ) who found that he suffered from a conduct disorder with possible co - morbid depressive illness , that he was very vulnerable and that he risked harming himself . On DATE an ambulance arrived at JS\u2019 home following reports of his violent behaviour and he was abusive to the ambulance men . He was arrested for affray . A psychiatric assessment ( DATE ) diagnosed depressive conduct with abuse of alcohol and other substances and found that JS was a risk to himself and others and that custody would increase the risk of self - harm . Given his unstable family situation , a protection order was made and he was admitted to a local authority children \u2019s home . On DATE JS and CARDINAL other children from the children \u2019s home carried out CARDINAL street robberies of mobile phones ( it was accepted in later proceedings that JS had played a peripheral role ) .", "On DATE he was convicted on the prior affray charge . He was sentenced to a DATE supervision order : he would continue in the children \u2019s home and follow training and treatment options . JS continued to demonstrate vulnerability and present serious management problems and self - harm risk . Another psychiatrist who examined JS in DATE expressed much concern about his fragile emotional state , recommending containment and constant vigilance .", "On DATE he appeared at ORG and pleaded guilty to the CARDINAL charges of robbery . He was convicted and remanded on bail to the children \u2019s home pending sentencing . In DATE he slashed his face in his room in the children \u2019s home CARDINAL times . The following day JS was reported as being under a great deal of pressure . He also went missing from the home from DATE but returned of his own volition , after which he was charged with a breach of bail .", "At the later hearing at ORG for sentencing on the robbery charges , his counsel drew the trial judge \u2019s attention to ORG ( prepared by ORG , \u201c ORG \u201d ) and , in particular , to references to his \u201c history of self harm and ... threatened suicide \u201d and to PERSON belief that the \u201c self harming behaviour may escalate \u201d . Attention was also drawn to a letter from the applicant \u2019s social worker which accompanied ORG and which also referred to attempted self - harm and to concern \u201c for his safety and welfare given his history of low mood of self - harm when in distress \u201d . When sentencing JS , the judge referred to those passages and stated that they had to be \u201c most expressly drawn to the attention of the authorities \u201d : that remark was made in the course of his counsel \u2019s submissions and was substantially repeated in the trial judge \u2019s sentencing remarks . ORG concluded that JS would be at particular risk in the event of a custodial order and it recommended ( supported by his social worker ) a ORG and Rehabilitation Order .", "On DATE in passing the sentence , the trial judge referred to remarks of the Lord Chief Justice that those who commit street robberies should receive immediate custodial sentences ( Attorney General \u2019s Reference Nos . CARDINAL and DATE [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG ( PERSON ) CARDINAL ) . He made a CARDINAL detention and training order ( a custodial order , \u201c ORG \u201d ) . JS could have been detained in ORG ( \u201c YOI \u201d ) , in FAC ( \u201c STC \u201d ) or in a ORG ( \u201c LASCH \u201d ) . ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) placed JS in PERSON and he was transferred on DATE .", "Although his counsel advised in favour of an appeal against sentence ( as manifestly excessive ) , an application for leave was not pursued .", "On arrival at PERSON was on an open FCARDINALSH form ( at risk of self - harm ) and placed in the health care unit . He was initially put in strip clothing ( simple linen tunic , held together by adhesive strips under which he was naked ) . He was placed in a cell with reduced ligature points , a surveillance camera and high levels of observations . Within DATE he was moved to a single cell ( in the health care unit ) with no surveillance camera or reduced ligature points . Observation was reduced to TIME intervals .", "An application was made by ORG for JS\u2019 transfer from the YOI but , prior to that being decided , on DATE JS was found dead , hanging from strips of linen attached to the bars of the window of his cell .", "On DATE following JS\u2019 death the GPE area manager for prisons instigated a prison service investigation ( assisted by an advisory panel made up of experts from ORG office , ORG and the ORG ) and it was completed on DATE .", "Deaths in custody are also automatically subject to ORG by a senior ORG manager or an independent consultant . ORG into the circumstances of JS\u2019 death was prepared by the ORG Manager of the ORG ( which had completed ORG ) and it was completed on DATE . This report was forwarded to the ORG in DATE and contributed to ORG . An interim report was presented to the ORG on DATE . A final report was prepared and presented to ORG on CARDINAL DATE following the receipt of the Coroner \u2019s verdict ( see below ) .", "Following advice received from ORG and the ORG , the relevant ORG ( ORG ) agreed to conduct a full investigation of LOC case under LAW guidance \u201c ORG to LAW \u201d DATE . An independent author was commissioned to prepare the overview report and to chair the multi - agency panel established to steer the review process . The \u201c LAW \u201d began on DATE and the Trafford ACPC adopted the final overview report in DATE .", "On DATE , during a debate in the ORG or ORG , one of the questions put to the ORG was whether there would be an independent inquiry into the death of JS . Lord PERSON of GPE responded on behalf of the Government . He noted that the Inquest would resume soon , that that would be complemented by a comprehensive summary of the lessons learned by the various agencies involved ( which results would be shared with the applicant ) and that , in the meantime , other improvements had been made to reception , protection and healthcare processes including training programmes .", "The applicant brought a civil claim against ORG and the ORG regarding JS\u2019 death alleging negligence and a breach of LAW DATE ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention ) in relation to his allocation by the ORG to PERSON and his treatment there . She also made a claim against the ORG under LAW ( in conjunction with ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention ) on the basis that the ORG was operating a discriminatory policy under which girls aged DATE , whether vulnerable or not , were given priority over vulnerable boys over DATE of age , for placement outside the prison service . The civil claim did not challenge the sentence imposed on JS as such a claim would have been prevented by section QUANTITY of LAW DATE .", "A payment into court was made by the respondents . The applicant \u2019s solicitor and counsel both advised her that the lodgement was a \u201c reasonable offer \u201d and a sum that she could reasonably expect from a court if the entirety of her claim was accepted . ( ORG later described this sum as \u201c substantial \u201d ) . She requested but was refused an admission of liability . The applicant felt obliged to accept the lodgement and the proceedings were settled in DATE , before the Inquest opened .", "The Inquest into JS\u2019 death took place DATE . The applicant was legally represented and present . The Inquest heard evidence , either in writing or in person , from CARDINAL witnesses including the Chief Executive of the ORG and the Governor of PERSON . The applicant submitted an expert report which outlined a number of factors which meant that boys of DATE were most likely to be allocated to YOIs given the increase in child imprisonment particularly of girls ; the increase of periods of custodial detention ; and the policy of the ORG to prioritise children of DATE of age for placement in STCs or LASCHs which inevitably reduced places for older juveniles . The above - noted reports of investigations already conducted were before the Coroner and he also commissioned his own expert psychiatric report in which the view was expressed that JS \u201c simply should never have been allocated to GPE \u201d .", "The Coroner defined the scope of the Inquest as follows :", "\u201c ( a ) JS having been sentenced ( we can not go behind the sentence ) , was all relevant and necessary information available to properly reach a decision as to the appropriate allocation for [ JS ] ?", "( b ) With that information and the sentencing PERSON remarks , what allocation options were available , what were considered and what criteria [ were ] used to exercise them ? The inquest can not go into matters of resources , save perhaps for observing that , if it is the case , that lack of resources may have been a factor whether critical or contributory ?", "( c ) Having been allocated to [ PERSON ] what then should have happened to [ JS ] ?", "( d ) What should have been the correct approach once [ JS ] was on the hospital wing ? Should more liaison have taken place between the Agencies . Did PERSON have all the necessary relevant information , did it make the correct risk/ care plan assessment ?", "( e ) To what extent did the differing Agencies know what the other was doing ? It appears that the GPE [ ORG ] were still trying to get [ JS ] transferred to a [ ORG ] whereas those within the [ YOI ] were seeking to integrate him into the main wing i.e. further within the prison system . On the face of it , these aims conflict .", "( f ) Should it have been clear that [ JS ] was to remain on the hospital wing until secure accommodation was found ? If so , should [ JS ] have been told this ?", "( g ) Is it correct that in the light of the experience of others in [ JS\u2019 ] position being successfully integrated into the main wing that it was then right for [ JS ] ? What if any thing was there to distinguish [ JS ] from any other inmate who had exhibited similar history and symptoms ? What if anything could have been done to indicate that [ JS ] was different to the previous inmates and that he would react in the way that he did ?", "( h ) Allocation and re - allocation I take as the same issue . The fact that the initial allocation did not succeed would that , as a matter of principle , negate the need to continue that process ? ...", "[ Sentencing policy ] or change in policy , which may on may not increase the number of children in custody , is not within the scope of this inquest . It is a matter of national interest which should be dealt with at that level .", "The Inquisition form completed by the jury recorded a unanimous verdict of \u201c Accidental death in part contributed because the risk was not properly recognised and appropriate precautions were not taken to prevent it . \u201d The jury also responded to a \u201c ORG questionnaire \u201d ( R ( PERSON ) v. GPE and CARDINAL ] CARDINALAC CARDINAL ) which had been prepared by the Coroner in consultation with the parties\u2019 legal representatives . A later report prepared by PERSON ( see below ) summarised the jury Inquest \u2019s conclusions and recommendations as follows :", "\u201c Quality of Pre - sentence Information", "The Inquest concluded there were weaknesses in both the quality and handling of information at the pre - sentence stage . Although the Jury accepted that the Asset format was an appropriate way to bring together relevant information about the young person , they were critical of the [ ORG ] for its completion of the Asset assessment material and drew attention to the \u2018 Do n\u2019t Know \u2018 responses to key aspects of the Asset framework that they considered inadequate . Attention was drawn towards the importance of providing additional documentary evidence to support the Asset judgement , especially where vulnerability was the issue . The Coroner emphasised throughout the importance of providing a good psychiatric assessment of the young person and ensuring that the court and all relevant parties were in possession of this material .", "Allocation Arrangements", "The Inquest was unanimous in its conclusion that the placement of [ JS ] in a ORG was not appropriate and that he should have been placed in a [ ORG ] . The Inquest heard evidence about the allocation arrangements and the difficulties in matching young people \u2019s needs and appropriate services given the limited capacity of the local authority secure sector . The Coroner expressed great concern about this situation and also drew attention to those vulnerable DATE who , because of their age , appeared even less likely to be able to access a secure children \u2019s home .", "The Coroner also recommended that the system for placement should hold open for a longer period the possibility of transfer to more suitable accommodation . Young people who are disturbed and vulnerable need to feel , and be made aware , that their initial placement may be reviewed . The Jury recommended that young people such as [ JS ] should be held in some temporary intermediate provision outside the main YOI estate while such considerations took place .", "Quality of communication", "The Coroner and Jury were concerned by what they perceived as failures in the communication arrangements and the passing of information between professionals . They made a general recommendation that these arrangements should be subject to review and improvement . In particular , they drew attention to their concern about the availability of the psychiatrist \u2019s report and the gaps in communication between the [ ORG ] and PERSON in respect of the transfer application . They also felt that more prominent means should be found by which to signal levels of risk .", "PERSON YOI ORG", "The Inquest concluded that the care and attention given to [ JS ] by the medical , nursing and YOI staff at ORG was provided in an appropriate way . However , there was unanimous condemnation of the building and its facilities .", "Use of Safe Clothing", "The Inquest learnt that [ JS ] had spent DATE and nights in ORG wearing only safer cell clothing with no underwear . Although this clothing was issued for [ JS\u2019 ] self protection , the Coroner and his Jury were concerned with the possible de - humanising aspects of this approach and recommended that the practice be reviewed . \u201d", "The single judge in later judicial review proceedings found that the Inquest was \u201c a model of what was required to discharge the ORG \u2019s investigative obligation under LAW .", "On DATE the Coroner wrote to the Secretary of ORG ( Rule CARDINAL of LAW ) requesting a public inquiry :", "\u201c Without going behind the sentence [ JS ] received at this Inquest it does seem to me essential that there is an urgent and comprehensive review of the pre - sentence exercise , the allocation process and the availability and provision of [ LASCHs ] . The statistics indicate that more young offenders are being sent to custody without a proportionate increase in [ LASCHs ] to accommodate the inevitable increased proportion of those receiving such sentences who are considered to be vulnerable . ...", "It seemed clear to me that the allocation of disturbed and vulnerable young children ( typically DATE boys ) should be determined on a needs basis and not a resources basis . This is all the more important if Courts are sentencing such vulnerable and disturbed young offenders in the belief , mistaken or not , that recommendations , such as that contained in the pre - sentence report and endorsed by the Sentencing Judge can be implemented ...", "In all the circumstances , and so that it can include Sentencing Policy which is an essential ingredient but outside the scope of the Inquest , I consider that the ORG should take the form of a Public Inquiry where all interested parties can make their views known . \u201d", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG responded to the Coroner that a public inquiry was not necessary given CARDINAL reviews which he had initiated as regards the broader issues underlying JS\u2019 death :", "\u201c In fact the new ORG [ \u201c ORG \u201d ] , established by the Government , and which is chaired by the Lord Chief Justice , is currently considering new guidelines on sentencing for robbery . I think it is right for the [ ORG ] to be the body which addresses the issues arising from [ JS\u2019 ] sentence , and I am formally asking the [ ORG ] to do this . I understand why you wanted to recommend a public inquiry to tackle this , but I think that the [ ORG ] does provide the most appropriate forum .", "The operational issues you drew attention to are important and need to be looked into by someone with the necessary expertise to identify the realistic scope for improvement . I am asking PERSON , a former Assistant Chief Inspector of ORG , to do this . PERSON conducted the recent inquiry into the death of [ X ] . I enclose a copy of his terms of reference .", "The configuration and development of the juvenile secure estate is a longer - term issue , which the [ ORG ] is addressing as part of its work on a new vision for the future of juvenile custody - on which it will be putting proposals to Ministers DATE . We have asked the [ ORG ] to take full account of the concerns expressed in the verdict of the inquest jury and relayed in your letter . \u201d", "In response to the applicant \u2019s request for a public inquiry , on DATE the Parliamentary Under - Secretary essentially repeating the above response of the Secretary of ORG . By letter dated DATE the applicant was again informed that the Secretary of ORG did not intend to hold a public inquiry .", "On DATE the Coroner wrote to the Secretary of ORG re - expressing his concerns about the failure to hold a public inquiry . He welcomed the above - noted CARDINAL lines of inquiry but was concerned that they might not adequately coordinate between each other .", "On DATE ORG \u2019s ORG issued its Third Report of Session DATE on Deaths in Custody . Referring to JS\u2019 death and noting that there had never been a public inquiry into the death of a child in custody , it recommended a public inquiry and , further , that LASCHs should be used wherever possible with use of prison custody reduced to an absolute minimum . The Government \u2019s detailed response to the ORG was published on DATE and it , inter alia , referred to the CARDINAL internal reviews and the Inquest into LOC death . The CARDINAL concerns of the Coroner would each be addressed by an appropriate review : the appropriateness of the sentence would be addressed by the ORG , the effectiveness of pre - sentence and placement procedures would be addressed by an operational review by PERSON and the ORG would review whether the juvenile secure estate as then configured was able to fully provide for vulnerable young people . The ORG firmly believed that those measures were the most appropriate , useful and focussed .", "\u201c The Government agrees with the ORG \u2019s view that [ ORG ] should be used wherever possible for children , with the use of ORG custody reduced to an absolute minimum . The Government uses only [ ORG ] and comparable places in secure training centres for children DATE , and for the more vulnerable DATE . ... [ A]ny sort of custody for young people should be a last resort , and that approach is enshrined in legislation .... For those young people whom the courts do send to custody , the [ ORG ] seeks to make the best possible use of available accommodation , taking full account of age and other factors that contribute to vulnerability . [ ORG ] and [ STCs ] provide for the youngest trainees . It would not be appropriate for these young people to mix with older juveniles , who are generally placed in a [ YOI ] . The most vulnerable DATE are also held outside [ YOI ] . The [ ORG ] considers that more provision is needed for vulnerable CARDINAL and DATE boys , and its recent consultation paper Strategy for ORG proposes a new form of \u2018 intermediate\u2019 accommodation , with smaller - scale units and more intensive staff support for trainees , which would address this need ...", "The juvenile secure estate has evolved considerably since it was set up in DATE and continues to develop . The Government believes the proposals in Strategy for ORG the consultation period ends on DATE set a clear direction for the future of the estate . \u201d", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG requested the ORG to review the JS case during its current consideration of guidelines for robberies . The ORG considered advice from ORG on sentences for robberies ( notably of the type in JS\u2019 case ) and of juveniles . The ORG published draft guidelines and consulted publicly . In DATE \u201c The Definitive Sentencing Guidelines on Robbery \u201d were published by the ORG . The foreword noted that it was not intended to significantly change the prior practice of non - custodial sentences for the majority of young offenders who committed robbery . Certain recommendations were , however , made as regards the factors to be taken into consideration prior to making custodial sentences on young offenders including emphasising the welfare of the child . ORG ( see below ) noted that the applicant was invited to make representations to the ORG but she submitted to this ORG that she could not make an effective contribution to this process as her sole entitlement was to express her views as a member of the public .", "Following the adoption of ORG with additional provisions as regards sentencing young offenders ( including a comprehensive list of new community orders and a statutory recognition that a sentencing court must have regard to the welfare of the offender ) , the ORG then published further draft Guidelines ( DATE ) entitled \u201c Overarching Principles - Sentencing Youths \u201d , requesting comments by CARDINAL DATE . As regards both the underlying principles / approach to sentencing and the choice of sentencing options ( non - custodial and custodial sentences ) , the draft Guidelines emphasised the necessity for the trial court to consider the welfare of the young offender including the high incidence of mental health issues amongst young people in the criminal justice system , the vulnerability of young persons to self - harm ( particularly within a custodial environment ) and the high risks associated with young offenders in a custodial setting .", "The Secretary of ORG also requested the ORG to take full account of the issues raised in the Inquest and by the Coroner in its current work on the configuration and development of juvenile secure estate .", "In DATE the ORG published a draft strategy for the juvenile secure estate setting out the assumptions and principles that the ORG would use in developing the secure estate ( including enhanced provisions for vulnerable older boys ) and the steps it intended to take in DATE to deliver these within available resources .", "The context of the draft report was described as follows :", "\u201c ... the ORG has sought to incorporate within this strategy the lessons learnt from serious incidents that have occurred in the secure estate for children and young people . This includes a specific request ... to take account of the Coroner \u2019s concerns about the configuration and development of the secure estate in relation to vulnerable young offenders ( concerns expressed following the inquest into the tragic death of [ JS ] ) . \u201d", "Responses were invited from interested parties . The applicant was given a copy of the draft Report and was asked for her views and advice : she did not make submissions as she considered that it was not an independent inquiry as the ORG would not accept its responsibility in LOC death .", "The final report ( entitled \u201c Strategy for ORG to CARDINAL \u201d ) described the \u201c Context \u201d as including : a central theme of developing secure estate was that services in custody for young people were the same in custody as in the community ; the publication of the Government green paper ( \u201c ORG \u201d and the companion document ( \u201c Youth Justice \u2013 the Next Steps \u201d ) which again underlined the necessity to apply community service standards of child care in custody settings ; the adoption of LAW ( further to the Green Paper ) had explicitly placed responsibility for safeguarding and promoting welfare on , inter alia , providers of custody for children and young people , which was the first time that custody providers had been drawn into mainstream children \u2019s legislation in such an explicit way ; and it repeated the reference to the lessons to be learned from the death of JS .", "The assumptions that underpinned the Strategy were outlined . Custody should be used only as a last resort ( citing LAW on the Rights of the Child ) and the ORG would work with the ORG to agree on an operational definition of \u201c last resort \u201d . Custody should be used particularly sparingly for young offenders because of their dependent , developing and vulnerable status and , while proportionately greater use was made of custody for them in GPE , the ORG was committed to developing community - based alternatives in which sentencers had sufficient confidence so that their proportionate use of custody for children and young people would fall progressively and the average daily number in custody was reduced ; the principle , that punishment of custody lies in the loss of liberty itself and not in any gratuitously punitive aspect of the regime , should apply absolutely ; and secure establishments , whatever form they take , were scarce and expensive , and their portfolio and characteristics could only be changed slowly so that the ORG would work closely with existing providers and explore whether additional providers can be encouraged to enter the field . While the demand for places and the Government \u2019s provision of resources for such places were not determined by the ORG , it actively sought to influence both ; the type of regime or interventions provided in custody should be based on what research considers was effective in preventing children and young people from offending and reoffending ; and the rights of children and young people held in custody should be respected and upheld .", "As regards the guiding principles , the ORG \u2019s strategy was aspirational in the sense that it could not be achieved easily or quickly , given its starting point . The guiding principles of the ORG included ensuring a child - based culture , adequate and targeted training , safeguards and services needed to properly protect and assist young offenders .", "Finally , it noted that the present portfolio of provision for children and young people in custody remained less than ideal and that its ambition was to create a suitable secure estate based on the above principles as rapidly as reasonably possible . The speed at which the ORG would achieve its ambitions would depend on the sentencing rates and resources attributed so that even a DATE strategy might be ambitious but the ORG was working with the relevant bodies on these CARDINAL issues . The ORG went on to make detailed proposals for consolidating and enhancing the provision of places and services in the secure estate including for STCs , YOIs and FAC .", "It concluded that evidence of independent assessors demonstrated that there had been significant achievements in commissioning secure accommodation for children and young people since DATE , even if much remained to be done . An update to the strategy was published in DATE .", "PERSON ( a former Assistant Chief Inspector of ORG and Chairman of the GPE ACPC ) examined the operational issues arising from LOC case and , notably , the roles of the ORG , the ORG as well as the ORG itself . Having sent a draft of the ORG to ORG in DATE , he requested the applicant to make submissions . The applicant \u2019s solicitors requested a copy of the report . She maintained that she heard nothing further until DATE when PERSON contacted her indicating that a final draft of the ORG had been submitted to the Minister : the applicant again requested a copy of the report and , while PERSON was not at liberty to disclose the ORG , he wished to meet with her . A further request for a copy of the report was made . The applicant was not provided , as she requested , with access to the draft report , and she did not therefore make submissions .", "His final report entitled \u201c Review of the effectiveness of Operational Procedures for the Identification , Placement and Safeguarding of Vulnerable Young People in Custody \u201d was published by ORG on DATE . The agreed scope of the review , including the agreed Terms of Reference , was described in the ORG as follows :", "\u201c The review will analyse :", "- The policies , procedures and practices for the placement of young offenders , taking account of any recommendations that the [ ORG ] or ORG have made since [ JS\u2019 ] death , and whether further improvements can be made . The review will refer to ORG investigation , ORG on [ JS ] undertaken by the ORG and the work commissioned by ORG and the ORG ACPC Chapter CARDINAL review . These contain recommendations that encompass both correctional services and the safeguarding of children .", "The review will consider :", "- Whether the information and documentation that a [ ORG ] prepares for sentencers on young people at risk of a custodial sentence / placement is adequate and appropriate , taking into account the work that the ORG is doing on the management of risk in the community .", "- Whether improved guidance is needed on the [ ORG \u2019s ] assessment of vulnerability or risk .", "- Whether existing methods for the transfer of documentation between the [ ORG ] , the court , the [ YJB ] Placements Team and the receiving establishment need improvement .", "- The adequacy of YOI reception procedures and arrangements for the care of vulnerable trainees .", "- The appropriateness of protective clothing for young offenders at risk of self - harm .", "- Whether relevant changes are needed to staff training , in particular regarding the quality of the Asset assessment form , the risk of harm section and advice that the ORG is producing for [ YOTs ] : and the reception and care of vulnerable trainees .", "The review will be a fundamental part of informing the family of [ JS ] about progress and ensuring action is undertaken by the key agencies following his death .", "The review , in addition to findings on the matters listed above , will include a summary account of all investigations that have been conducted into [ JS\u2019 ] death and the operational issues arising from them . It will outline any implications for the juvenile secure arrangements as a whole and identify any recommended improvements . The review may make recommendations to the Minister on any good practice that is relevant to or becomes apparent during the review . \u201d", "The Report went on to highlight the main themes arising out of the CARDINAL internal investigations and the Inquest and from the terms of reference .

There should be consideration of the development of discrete facilities within the YOI sector for young people demonstrably at risk of self - harm or suicide . \u201d", "As to \u201c Quality of Assessment Work and the Management of Risk \u201d :", "\u201c All the Investigations concluded that , by CARDINAL means or another , the court considering [ JS\u2019 ] sentence had received explicit advice about his vulnerability , his history of self - harm and attempted suicide . Comparison was drawn between the quality of the pre - sentence report and the Asset assessment , the latter being considered incomplete and lacking in supporting evidence . \u201d", "As to \u201c Placement of children and young people at High Risk in the ORG \u201d :", "\u201c All the Investigations closely examined the operations of ORG . There was a generally agreed conclusion that , accepting the complexity of the team \u2019s task and the difficulties inherent in managing CARDINAL sectors with differential levels of availability , more clarity needed to be introduced into the placement arrangements . Issues concerning the quality and transmission of information , and the arrangements for transfer between placements were also highlighted . \u201d", "As to \u201c Reception of young people into YOIs \u201d", "\u201c The Investigations into [ JS ] death concluded that at his admission all reception procedures in force at that time were carried out satisfactorily and that [ JS ] received a high level of care and attention . However , all CARDINAL Investigations expressed reservation and uncertainty about the robustness of the transmission of information between the [ ORG ] and the YOI ; in particular the timely availability of his psychiatric history . \u201c", "As to \u201c Care and Sentence Planning \u201d :", "\u201c CARDINAL of the key issues identified by the various investigations into the death of [ JS ] related to the arrangements to plan for his stay at the YOI . There were concerns about the organisational arrangements for the planning meeting and its optimum timeliness . Some of the investigations recommended that a much shorter time than ORG ... of within DATE of admission should now be adopted . The ORG also expressed concern about arrangements for recording at YOIs \u201d", "As to \u201c Provision of Health Care \u201d", "\u201c Each of the CARDINAL Investigations into the death of [ JS ] concluded that the care and attention given to PERSON by the medical , nursing and YOI staff at the YOI ORG was of good quality and appropriate to his level of need .

This [ operational review ] has carefully examined them and made recommendations for improvement . The ORG and ORG have shown a commitment to change and have developed a set of policies and procedures that focus directly on safeguarding issues and have the potential capacity to deliver a more effective and safer service . But much more can be and needs to be done . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant requested leave to apply for judicial review arguing that CARDINAL central issues regarding the death of JS remained unresolved despite the Inquest : the extent to which the sentencing policy resulted in JS being detained in conditions that gave rise to an unacceptable risk of suicide and , secondly , the reasons why JS was allocated to a ORG rather than a ORG ( including any lack of resources contributed to that allocation ) . The applicant maintained that the Secretary of ORG , in deciding not to convene a full public inquiry , had failed to comply with his duty under LAW to investigate the circumstances of the death of JS . The Secretary of ORG argued that policy issues were beyond the scope of LAW and , alternatively , that the combination of the CARDINAL internal investigations , the Inquest and the CARDINAL reviews proposed by the Secretary of ORG satisfied the requirements of LAW . On DATE the applicant was granted leave to apply for judicial review . By judgment delivered CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the judicial review proceedings . On DATE leave to appeal to ORG was granted .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal .", "The principal judgment was that of Lord Justice PERSON . He noted the evidence at the Inquest to the effect that JS should not have been at PERSON but at a ORG , that he would have been placed in a YOI even had the judge \u2019s remarks been considered by the ORG and , given the available resources , it was almost inevitable , or overwhelmingly likely , that JS would go to a YOI . The trial judge was not at fault : his sentence was lawful , he specifically requested that information as to JS\u2019 vulnerability be passed to the appropriate authorities and he was not obliged to inquire further since the duty to place offenders is upon the Secretary of ORG . While Lord Justice Pill did not exclude that a sentence could itself breach ORG CARDINAL of the Convention , the present sentence did not .", "The evaluation of the circumstances in which JS died was \u201c thorough and no complaint about it is made in an LAW context \u201d . Where failures were identified , however , investigation of the facts did not complete performance of the ORG \u2019s obligations \u201c unless consideration is given to effecting improvements \u201d ( Lord Justice PERSON referring to domestic jurisprudence and to PERSON v. GPE , ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . He continued :", "\u201c Where the failures are of the kind identified in the present case , I do not consider that the ORG \u2019s statement in PERSON that \u201c wider questions \u201d fall outside the scope of LAW is , as the law has now been interpreted , applicable to render unnecessary enquiries beyond the factual investigation provided by the Inquest . The statement in GPE that detailed investigation of policy issues may not be necessary was in the context of a defective investigation of the facts . Such a defect does not necessarily give rise to policy issues . ...", "The evidence at the Inquest revealed a worrying situation with regard to the detention of young offenders . On the evidence , vulnerable young offenders , such as [ JS ] , have been detained in conditions unsuitable for their safety and their lives . That having been revealed in a properly conducted Inquest , there is , in my judgment , a duty upon the Secretary of ORG to investigate further what remedial action can be taken . Thorough investigation of facts at an Inquest would have little value in preventing a repetition and in maintaining public confidence , unless followed up . \u201d", "As a fact finding tribunal , the Inquest jury operated effectively . However , the jury could not be expected to give answers to questions of resources and policy which could provide reliable guides to an improvement in conditions .", "However , there had been a substantial public debate and it was continuing . The investigations , assessments and debates in progress were such that the applicant had not established that the Secretary of ORG was in breach of LAW by failing to convene a public inquiry :", "\u201c I am far from persuaded that setting up a public inquiry is the only way in which the obligation under LAW can be discharged in this case . It is not a case in which the respondent , either expressly or by inaction , has failed to confront the issues which have emerged or failed to give serious consideration to possible improvements . The combination of the Inquest and the measures taken , including the input into the deliberations of the ORG , have achieved compliance with the LAW obligation .", "Questions of sentencing policy and of the allocation of resources are essentially for collegiate consideration and decisions by the Government , following procedures which are well established , including those by which guidance is given to judges . I can not hold that the only appropriate action is for a judge , however eminent , to be given the task of resolving such issues , at or following a public inquiry . \u201d", "As to the participation of the family of JS in the investigation , Lord Justice PERSON noted that the family and their advisors were fully involved at the Inquest and in subsequent representations to the Secretary of ORG . They had also been invited to make representations to the ORG .", "\u201c The bereaved family and their advisors were fully involved at the Inquest and in subsequent representations to the Secretary of ORG . They have been invited to make representations to the ORG . It is recognised that they can make an input into questions of policy and resources but , because broad issues of public concern are involved , many other factors have to be taken into account and involvement in those issues can not be expected to be to the same degree . Participation in issues of sentencing policy and the allocation of resources are in a different category from the investigation of facts in the particular case .", "He concluded :", "\u201c If I am right that the LAW duty may extend beyond a factual investigation into a search for improvements , issues of policy may arise . In addressing them , the appropriate extent of the family \u2019s involvement required , however serious the impact of the events upon them , is likely to be less than with the investigation of the facts . I do not accept that concern for the family \u2019s involvement imposes an obligation on the Secretary of ORG to hold a public inquiry .", "Lady ORG agreed with the above reasoning and added that a distinction was to be drawn between \u201c legal and political questions \u201d . The applicant could not , by way of individual rights under LAW , intervene in the political process which determined the allocation of resources as this would be to carry Convention rights further than LAW jurisprudence required ( citing ORG and Others v. the GPE , no .

Those high rates of incarceration had inevitably impacted on the conditions of detention . Special attention to the educational and psychological needs of juveniles and young offenders was required if their detention , at such a critical time in their development , was to contribute to their rehabilitation and reinsertion and it was difficult to conclude that those imperatives were being entirely satisfied . Indeed the overall impression of the Commissioner was of a detention system that placed too much emphasis on punishment and control and not enough on rehabilitation .", "As far as juveniles were concerned , the Commissioner was informed that their conditions of detention had improved in DATE with greater investment in FAC and STCs and in the services provided to children detained in DATE .

If we were intending to do so , we would have sought the advice of ORG before giving this judgment . Instead , we are seeking to draw together the principles which are already clearly established by the reported decisions of this court . Before coming to the facts of the individual applications , we wish to set out certain information which has been obtained by research conducted on behalf of ORG . It is published as Study CARDINAL , dated DATE , entitled \u201c Mobile Phone Theft \u201d . The research contains certain findings as to the level of mobile phone thefts and robberies and identifies a marked increase in the incidents of such offences . ... MONEY of those asked said that they had been victimised at least once . The risk of phone theft for those in DATE is CARDINAL times higher than that for adults . The results show a substantial growth involving the theft of telephones . Figures from CARDINAL police forces suggest that the number of recorded phone thefts has at least doubled CARDINAL . There was an increase in the proportion of robberies involving telephones from MONEY in DATE ( CARDINAL phone robberies ) , to MONEY in DATE ( CARDINAL phone robberies ) . No doubt part of the increase was due to the greater phone ownership during that period . ...", "Faced with that background the courts have no alternative but to adopt a robust sentencing policy towards those who commit these offences . Those who do so must understand that they will be punished severely . Custodial sentences will be the only option available to the courts when these offences are committed , unless there are exceptional circumstances . That will apply irrespective of the age of the offender and irrespective of whether the offender has previous convictions .
