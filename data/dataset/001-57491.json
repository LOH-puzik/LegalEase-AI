Following the death of his mother , he was received into care by ORG under section CARDINAL of the Children Act DATE ( \" LAW \" ) on DATE . Save for CARDINAL periods varying DATE and DATE when he was discharged to the care of his father , the applicant remained in voluntary care until DATE . On DATE the applicant appeared before ORG and pleaded guilty to a number of offences including burglary and theft . The court made a care order in respect of him under section CARDINAL of the Children and Young Persons Act DATE . The applicant ceased to be in the care of ORG on attaining the age of majority ( CARDINAL ) on DATE .", "During the major part of the period while he was in care the applicant was boarded out with various foster parents , subject to the provisions of the Boarding - Out of Children Regulations DATE ( \" LAW \" ) . Under the terms of those regulations the local authority was under a duty to keep certain confidential records concerning the applicant and his care ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contends that he was ill - treated in care , and since his majority has wished to obtain details of where he was kept and by whom and in what conditions in order to be able to help him to overcome his problems and learn about his past .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant was permitted by a social worker in the employment of ORG to see the case records relating to him kept by ORG of the ORG in accordance with its statutory duty . He removed those records without the ORG \u2019s consent , retaining them in his possession until he returned them to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG It is the practice of the local authorities to keep a case record in respect of every child in care . In respect of children boarded out they were and are under a statutory duty to keep case records by virtue of LAW , which were made under LAW of GPE , so far as relevant , provides that :", "\" PERSON ) A local authority shall compile a case record in respect of -", "( a ) every child boarded out by them ;", "( b ) ...", "( c ) ... and the said records shall be kept up - to - date .", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) Every case record compiled under this ORG or a microfilm recording thereof shall be preserved for DATE after the child to whom it relates has attained DATE or has died before attaining that age , and such microfilm recording or , where there is none , such case record shall be open to inspection at all reasonable times by any person duly authorised in that behalf by the Secretary of ORG . \"", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , wishing to bring proceedings against the local authority for damages for negligence , made an application under LAW of ORG DATE ( \" LAW \" ) for discovery of the local authority \u2019s case records made during his period in care . LAW provides , inter alia , that the High Court shall have power to order such disclosure to a person who is likely to be a party to legal proceedings for personal injuries .", "CARDINAL . The application was heard by ORG on DATE . The local authority objected to the grant of discovery of the records on the ground that disclosure and production would be contrary to the public interest . The principal contributors to those case records were medical practitioners , school teachers , police and probation officers , social workers , health visitors , foster parents and residential school staff . Their contributions to the case records were treated in the strictest confidence and it was in the interest of the effective conduct of the care system that such records should be as full and frank as possible . If discovery were ordered , the public interest in the proper operation of the child - care service would be jeopardised since the contributors to the records would be reluctant to be frank in their reports in the future .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contended that the case records held by the local authority should be made available to him on the general principles of discovery , for the purpose of his proposed proceedings for personal injuries against the local authority . He further argued that it was also in the public interest that some measure of review of the standard of care provided by a local authority to a child in care be available .", "CARDINAL . The judge did not read the records in question , but balanced the public interest in maintaining an efficient child - care system with the applicant \u2019s private interest in receiving access to his case records for the purpose of the proposed litigation . After referring to the case of Re D ( infants ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports ( \" ORG \" ) CARDINAL , in which Lord PERSON , Master of the Rolls , held that case records compiled pursuant to LAW of the DATE Regulations were regarded as private and confidential , he concluded :", "\" I am left in no doubt that it is necessary for the proper functioning of the child care service that the confidentiality of the relevant documents should be preserved . This is a very important service to which the interests - also very important - of the individual must , in my judgment , bow . I have no doubt that the public interest will be better served by refusing discovery and this I do . \"", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed from this decision to ORG . On DATE the ORG unanimously dismissed the appeal . In ORG view , ORG , in its judgment , had correctly balanced the competing interests . It added that the inspection of a document is a course which it is proper for a court to take in certain cases , for example where grave doubt arises and the court can not properly decide upon which side the balance of public and private interests falls without itself inspecting the documents . However , this was not a case in which such doubt arose as would make it proper for the court itself to inspect the documents . ORG decision was accordingly affirmed and leave to appeal to ORG was refused ( PERSON v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG set up ORG ( \" ORG \" ) to make recommendations on access to personal social services files and to investigate the allegations relating to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG recommended making available case records to ex - clients of the social services , subject to certain safeguards and restrictions relating in particular to medical and police information . As to the applicant , ORG viewed with concern the number of placements which he had while in care , and which they recognised could be detrimental to a young person \u2019s development , but found no evidence to suggest that \" the officers carried out their duties in other than a caring manner \" . The applicant was to be allowed access to , and to make photocopies of , his case records , subject however to the exclusion of medical and police information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG recommendations , subject to an amendment which would require the consent of members of the medical profession and police services to be sought to the disclosure of information which they had contributed , were embodied in a resolution of ORG . However , PERSON , a dissenting member of ORG , brought an action challenging the resolution and obtained an interlocutory court order preventing ORG from implementing it until the trial of the action or until further order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG passed a further resolution . As regards future records this reiterated the general terms of the resolution of DATE and added certain further restrictions to protect information given in confidence and to provide for the non - disclosure of the whole or part of the personal record in particular cases , but as regards information obtained and compiled before CARDINAL March CARDINAL it was resolved that this should be disclosed only with the consent of the suppliers thereof . Pursuant to this policy the resolution went on to instruct the ORG \u2019s officers to contact the various suppliers of information to the PERSON file immediately with a view to disclosure . The local authority \u2019s officers were , however , ordered not to implement this resolution pending the outcome of the legal action brought by PERSON . This action was discontinued on CARDINAL DATE and on DATE the local authority confirmed a further resolution to the effect that the resolution of DATE would be implemented as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued Circular LAC ( ORG ) ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL to local authorities and health authorities pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG DATE setting out the principles governing the disclosure of information in social services case records to persons who were the subject of the records . The general policy laid down in paragraph CARDINAL of the circular was that persons receiving personal social services should , subject to adequate safeguards , be able to discover what is said about them in social services records and with certain exceptions should be allowed to have access thereto . Paragraph CARDINAL set out under CARDINAL headings the reasons for withholding information . These included the protection of third parties who contributed information in confidence , protecting sources of information , and protecting social service department staff \u2019s confidential judgments . Paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL set out in more specific terms the policy governing client access to case records . Paragraph CARDINAL in particular defined the considerations to be weighed on the other side of the balance whenever an application was made for access , the most relevant for the purposes of the present case being that \" information shall not be disclosed to the client if derived in confidence from a third party without the consent of the third party \" . However , it was then provided in paragraph CARDINAL that since existing records had been compiled on the basis that their contents would never be disclosed , material entered in the records prior to the introduction of the new policy should in no event be disclosed without the permission of the contributor of the information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG granted the Attorney General leave to apply for judicial review of the resolution of CARDINAL DATE as amended by that of DATE on the ground that it went beyond what were considered to be the proper limits and , in particular , omitted certain important safeguards which were contained in Circular LAC ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL . Pending the trial of the action an injunction was granted restraining the local authority from implementing the resolution of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG confirmed a further resolution of its ORG of DATE setting out certain additional grounds on which information should be withheld . The resolution provided that the information in the applicant \u2019s file should be made available to him if the contributors to the file ( or as regards some information ORG ) consented and that the various contributors of the information contained in the file should be contacted for their permission before the release of that information . Following the passing of this resolution , which was in line with Government Circular LAC ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Attorney General withdrew his application for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s case record consisted of some CARDINAL documents contributed by CARDINAL persons . On DATE copies of CARDINAL documents supplied by CARDINAL persons were sent to the applicant \u2019s solicitors . These were documents whose authors had consented to disclosure to the applicant . The size of each contribution disclosed varied from CARDINAL letter to numerous letters and reports .", "CARDINAL . ORG Those contributors who refused to waive confidentiality , although not asked to give reasons , stated , inter alia , that third - party interests could be harmed ; that the contribution would be of no value if taken out of context ; that professional confidence was involved ; that it was not the practice to disclose reports to clients ; and that too great a period of time had elapsed for a letter or report still to be in the contributor \u2019s recollection .", "Furthermore , in DATE , CARDINAL contributor refused his consent to disclosure on the ground that it would be detrimental to the applicant \u2019s interests .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG wrote to the applicant \u2019s solicitors in the following terms :", "\" I refer to your letter dated DATE .", "I would wish to be as helpful as possible to you , but at DATE suspect that we may have genuine differences of opinion . At least I take that to be the implication of the questions you asked .", "I do not think therefore , that we can take this correspondence further in a profitable way because , as I have said , it is , in the last analysis , for the provider of information , retrospectively collected , to release or refuse to release , in their absolute discretion , the information supplied from the \u2018 confidential\u2019 embargo originally accorded to it . The reasons for releasing or not releasing are irrelevant whether they are good , bad or indifferent .", "I regret I do not feel able to help you further . \"", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Regulations DATE came into force . These regulations , made under ORG DATE and further explained in ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL , impose upon social services departments a duty to give to any individual access to personal information held concerning him , except for personal health information which originated from a health professional and subject to the exceptions in LAW . This latter provision exempts from the obligation of disclosure , inter alia , any information from which the identity of another individual ( other than a social service employee ) , who has not consented to the disclosure of the information , would be likely to be disclosed or deduced by the individual who is the subject of the information or any other person who is likely to obtain access to it .", "According to the Government , the effect of LAW ( CARDINAL ) is that , in future , case records will be compiled on the basis that the information contained therein is liable to be disclosed , except in so far as disclosure would be likely to reveal the identity of the informant or another third party . However , by virtue of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG , the DATE Regulations apply only to information recorded after the ORG came into force , that is , after DATE . As in the case of Circular LAC ( CARDINAL ) DATE , which governed the adoption of the resolution mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above and the subsequent partial release of documents to PERSON , ORG Regulations DATE do not have retrospective effect ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
