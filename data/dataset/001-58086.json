She was born in DATE and died in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . She lived in GPE , where she worked as a taxi driver .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the events in question , PERSON was divorced and living with her youngest son , who was born in DATE . From DATE , PERSON was unable to work as a result both of dental problems which caused her severe pain and anxiety about a dispute with her landlord .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE she contacted a psychiatric clinic in GPE in order to receive a medical certificate which would enable her to claim sickness benefit from ORG . From DATE the applicant was treated by the chief psychiatrist who drew her attention to the possible detrimental effect her situation might have on her son and advised her to seek support for him from the children 's psychiatric clinic or the social authorities . PERSON , however , considered that her son was a normal child who was not in need of any particular help .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the psychiatrist informed PERSON that since the child 's health might be at risk , she ( the psychiatrist ) had an obligation under NORP law to contact the social authorities ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below ) . Accordingly , she telephoned a social - welfare officer at ORG ( socialn\u00e4mnden ) and informed her of the applicant 's health problems . At the request of that officer the psychiatrist submitted the following written statement on DATE :", "\u201c PERSON has had a polyclinical contact with a psychiatrist at [ the clinic ] since CARDINAL DATE , from CARDINAL DATE with the undersigned . The reason has been a pain condition in connection with dental problems and this has caused her being on sick - leave as from DATE . The patient does not consider herself to be mentally ill but she has accepted the contact with us solely due to her need to be put on the sick - list .", "In my opinion she has an extreme personality and her thoughts are , in conversations here , occupied by her severe pain condition and her dissatisfaction with the treatment she has received . She has once in a while had her son with her . He seemed quiet and sensitive .", "The undersigned , as well as others in the medical service with whom the patient has been in contact , have worried about the possible effect of her severe pain condition on the son whom she cares for alone . I have on several occasions drawn her attention to this , inter alia in letters ( please see copy ) , and asked her to contact [ the children 's psychiatric clinic ] or the social authorities . As , apparently , this has not been done , I called you DATE and I now send a written account of the case as agreed .", "As I do not find that , from a psychiatric point of view , we can do more for the patient , who does not consider herself to be mentally ill , I have referred her to the district medical officer and she will , thus , have no further contact with me . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter the same day , the psychiatrist notified the applicant of the information imparted to the ORG . The relevant part of the letter read as follows :", "\u201c As you know , I have several times asked you to seek support for your son who , naturally , can not remain unaffected by your severe pains . As I have not been able to convince you that this is necessary , I have called [ a ] social - welfare officer and expressed my concern . Unfortunately , I find myself obliged under the law to take this action in an attempt to reduce future problems for the boy ( and thereby also for you ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The psychiatrist 's concern for the applicant 's son was shared by the headmaster and a teacher at the school he attended . In DATE they had contacted ORG and expressed concern about his learning difficulties and his general state of health . Following this , the ORG commenced an investigation which , with PERSON agreement , led to the placement of her son in a non - residential therapeutic school on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of chapter CARDINAL of the Freedom of the Press Act ( ORG ) , which is part of LAW , everyone is entitled to access to public documents , subject to exceptions set out in LAW ( Sekretesslagen , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

Notwithstanding this rule of confidentiality , in certain circumstances health and medical - care authorities are required to submit information to another authority . Thus , chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , of LAW provides the following :", "\u201c Secrecy does not prevent ... the disclosure of information to another authority , if an obligation to disclose the information is laid down in an act of law or a government ordinance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Such an obligation follows from section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( ORG , CARDINAL ) , subsections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of which read as follows :", "\u201c Authorities whose activities relate to children and young persons as well as other authorities within health and medical - care and social services are obliged immediately to report to ORG if , in the course of their activities , they receive information which may imply that an intervention by ORG is necessary for the protection of a minor .

At the time of the enactment of LAW , the ORG 's ORG ( PERSON socialutskott ) stated that the reporting obligation was not limited to cases where it was clear that ORG would have to intervene . In addition , unconfirmed information or information which was difficult to assess should also be reported , if it implied that a child might be in need of support or assistance from the ORG . In such cases it would be for the ORG to investigate whether there was any factual basis for the information in question and whether there was a need for any particular measure ( see the report of ORG , ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The obligation to report only concerns information which is of relevance to ORG investigation . It does not extend to other information concerning the persons in question ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .

Action may be taken by the individual against the physician or his or her employer .", "CARDINAL . Public authorities and their employees are , furthermore , subject to the supervision of the Chancellor of ORG ( NORP ) and ORG ( PERSON ) .
