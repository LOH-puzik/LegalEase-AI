{"ITEMID": "001-112831", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "ESP", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2008, "DOCNAME": "MONEDERO ANGORA v. SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr LOC , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in FAC . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON del Rosal , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE and remanded in custody in execution of a NORP arrest warrant issued by the NORP judicial authorities following a judgment by the PERSON tribunal de grande instance delivered in his absence on DATE . In that judgment , the court had sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for a drug - related offence .", "On DATE central examining magistrate no . CARDINAL referred the case to the Audiencia Nacional for a decision on the merits . However , he considered that the statutory time - limit for surrendering the applicant to the NORP authorities had not been complied with and that the application to have the applicant surrendered to the NORP authorities could therefore be rejected , the applicant being opposed to it .", "On DATE the applicant submitted an application for bail , arguing that there was nothing to indicate that he had committed the offence in respect of which the NORP courts had delivered their judgment in DATE . ORG dismissed his application by a decision of DATE .", "However , on DATE the same court ordered the applicant \u2019s release . At the same time , it requested the NORP authorities to provide the fingerprints of the person who had been detained in GPE , and asked ORG for the fingerprints of the person who was the subject of the extradition request .", "In a decision of DATE , the Audiencia Nacional agreed to surrender the applicant to the NORP authorities . It noted that the procedure complied with the conditions laid down in PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , which had been enacted in GPE pursuant to the obligations on the ORG under the framework decision on the NORP arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between member GPE adopted by ORG on DATE ( ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) . The decision made the surrender of the applicant to the NORP authorities conditional on any sentence that might be imposed upon him being executed in GPE , as the judgment convicting him had been delivered in his absence and was therefore subject to appeal .", "On DATE the applicant submitted an application for interpretation ( aclaraci\u00f3n ) of that decision . The application concerned , firstly , whether he had been identified and by what means and , secondly , the application to his case of LAW DATE on passive extradition and not of the framework decision of ORG of DATE , given that the facts at the origin of the criminal proceedings in GPE had taken place between DATE and DATE . On DATE the Audiencia Nacional dismissed the application , considering that the contested decision did not fall into the category of cases subject to an application for interpretation under section CARDINAL of LAW . Owing to an error , the applicant was not informed that his application had been dismissed .", "On DATE , the Audiencia Nacional ordered that the applicant be detained for surrender to the NORP authorities . An appeal ( recurso de s\u00faplica ) lodged against that decision was dismissed on DATE , as the measure had been adopted for the purposes of surrendering the applicant to the NORP authorities but the applicant could still serve the final sentence in GPE .", "Relying on DATE ( right to a fair trial ) in conjunction with ORG ( right to freedom ) and CARDINAL ( principle of legality ) of the LAW , the applicant lodged an amparo appeal ( action for infringement of fundamental rights ) with ORG against the decisions of DATE and DATE and DATE . ORG dismissed the appeal in a judgment delivered on DATE and served on DATE .", "It dismissed the complaints relating to the decision of DATE as they were out of time , and considered that the applicant had not been adversely affected by the failure to notify him of the rejection of his application for interpretation of the decision delivered on DATE because that application had clearly been futile .", "With regard to the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE relating to the detention of the applicant for the purposes of surrendering him to the NORP authorities , ORG noted that the amparo appeal did not contain any complaint about those decisions ; the applicant had confined himself to arguing , firstly , that the Audiencia Nacional should have applied the extradition law , which he considered to be of greater relevance to his case , and not PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the NORP arrest warrant and , secondly , that the NORP criminal proceedings resulting in a NORP arrest warrant being issued against him had related to a statute - barred offence . In that connection , ORG observed that it was not its task to reconstruct the reasons given by applicants for lodging an appeal .", "The applicant then requested that the decision of DATE be served on him , which was done on DATE . On DATE he lodged a further amparo appeal with ORG . In a decision of DATE , the court dismissed the appeal , holding that an application for interpretation which artificially extended the proceedings was inadmissible .", "\u201c CARDINAL . The courts can not amend decisions once they have been signed ; however they can interpret obscure concepts and correct clerical errors ... \u201d", "\u201c ... The purpose of this PERSON is to fulfil the obligations which the framework decision creates for the member GPE , and which consist of replacing extradition procedures with a new procedure for surrender [ to the authorities of the applicant ORG ] of persons who are suspected of having committed an offence or who try to escape justice after being convicted by a final decision . ...", "The application of the principle of mutual recognition requires that , once the competent authority has received the NORP warrant with a view to its execution , this takes place practically automatically , without the judicial authority that executes the warrant having to examine the application again to verify its conformity with domestic law . Therefore , the reasons enabling the judicial authority to refuse execution are laid down by law , and the nature [ of the warrant ] allows that authority to make an objective assessment . Thus the usual reasons for refusal in extradition proceedings are eliminated , such as those relating to the non - surrender of nationals or to the fact that certain offences are considered to be political offences .", "The extremely innovative nature of this procedure is even clearer if we consider that it applies to the long list of categories of offences set out in the framework decision , for which the existence of double criminality can no longer be verified . Accordingly , when the judicial authority receives a NORP arrest warrant for one of the types of offence listed , and provided that the corresponding sentence exceeds a given threshold , it must proceed with execution , whether or not its criminal legislation provides for such an offence . ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
