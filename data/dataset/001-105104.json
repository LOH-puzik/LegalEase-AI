The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the pronouncement of the divorce of the applicant and his wife , the Budapest IV / XV ORG placed the applicant \u2019s child \u2013 born in DATE with the mother .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was thereafter not able to see his son due to the mother \u2019s reluctance to hand over the child .", "CARDINAL . NORP The parents managed to reach a settlement about the father \u2019s access rights concerning visits until DATE , which was approved by ORG on DATE . According to the arrangement , the applicant was allowed to see his son every second DATE from TIME , the day after GPE at TIME and during DATE from CARDINAL until DATE and from CARDINAL until DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Until CARDINAL DATE the applicant managed to see his son only rarely , since the mother refused to comply with the arrangement on most occasions . From DATE he was fully denied access to the child by his former wife .", "CARDINAL . The applicant repeatedly complained to the local guardianship authority as from that date and requested it to take effective measures in order for him to be able to exercise his access rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the competent GPE XV ORG heard both parents , warned the mother to allow the applicant to see his son and imposed fines on her . However , these fines were later cancelled .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the case was transferred to the GPE ORG . Since a warning issued in DATE was to no avail , it fined the mother MONEY ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) on DATE and a further ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings , initiated ex officio by ORG , to place the child under protection ( \u201c v\u00e9delembe v\u00e9tel \u201d ) , finding no reason for it . The child welfare service contacted the parents in an attempt to find a solution to the situation . It prepared an environment study at the mother \u2019s home , establishing that it was ideal for the upbringing of the child , who was in a loving relationship with his mother . However , it emphasised the importance of and need for a balanced contact between the child and his father .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant had had no contact with his child since DATE , he lodged complaints with various authorities , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . The Guardianship Authority then contacted a child upbringing counsellor ( \u201c nevel\u00e9si tan\u00e1csad\u00f3 \u201d ) who recommended the assistance of a foundation specialised in facilitating visits . It therefore ordered that the regular visits scheduled for the period DATE and DATE be held at the foundation \u2019s LOC . It appears that there was therefore some contact between the applicant and his son in this period . The applicant \u2019s relationship with his son was examined and found to be harmonious . Subsequently , ORG invited both parents to a reconciliatory meeting on DATE . This , however , proved to be unsuccessful . The father \u2019s environment was also examined , and it was established that the conditions were appropriate to hold the visits there . The authority recommended a gradual extension of the duration of the contact between the father and the child .", "CARDINAL . The Guardianship Authority drew up a new access schedule on DATE and warned the parents once again to respect these arrangements . However , the mother continued to deny access to the child .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s repeated complaints to various authorities about the failure to take adequate action to enforce his rights , on DATE the GPE ORG again warned the mother and took CARDINAL separate decisions concerning the visits not ensured in DATE , imposing a series of fines on her in the total amount of ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . On DATE it initiated the child \u2019s placement under protection . Subsequently , on DATE ORG imposed a further fine of HUF CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) for the overdue visits from DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG also ordered police assistance twice in DATE . Afterwards , the applicant managed to see his son until DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the applicant initiated an action before the Budapest IV / XIV District Court in DATE , seeking a change of custody and requesting the temporary placement of the child with him as an interim measure . Since no measures were taken thereafter , he submitted a petition to the ombudsman , asking for his assistance .", "CARDINAL . Eventually , ORG , acting as a second - instance court , rejected the maintenance of contact with the child via the foundation mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above , and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG , ORG quashed the decisions of the Budapest ORG described in paragraph CARDINAL above , thereby withdrawing the fines imposed and the order to initiate the child \u2019s placement under protection , without the possibility to appeal against the decision . ORG established that the decisions of the guardianship authority had been unlawful and it discontinued the administrative proceedings concerning the exercise of the applicant \u2019s access rights prior to DATE . It nevertheless ordered ORG to take effective measures to ensure the applicant \u2019s rights by using the range of measures at its disposal and not only through the imposition of fines . ORG pointed out , inter alia , that :", "\u201c ... [ t]he fact that the administration of minor ORG \u2019s case concerning access got to a guardianship authority that instantly sanctions the mother for the overdue visits is good , but other measures would be required as well , as it seems that the fines do not lead to any result , the goal being to enable GPE PERSON to exercise his visiting rights regarding his son . That is why the guardianship authority should initiate the placement of the child under protection and consider intervening in the custody proceedings on the side of the father . This should have been done already by the previous guardianship authority . The placement of the child under protection was initiated once by LAW , but the proceedings were discontinued by ORG on the ground that the child \u2019s care may be provided through basic service . The guardianship authority did not request the review of the decision despite the fact that the failure of care in basic service had been fully manifest . ...", "Overall , it can be established that the first - instance guardianship authorities were not controlling the situation , revoking the fines imposed on formal grounds . ... ORG was a \u201c spectator \u201d to the situation , hindered the enforcement proceedings several times ; on the basis of the appeal even it could have clarified whether the visits took place , or could have requested the first - instance guardianship authority to hear the parties , once they made the mistake of transferring the case file to the court without having made copies of at least the proceedings pending preceding the transfer . ...", "The second - instance guardianship authority also omitted [ to fulfil its obligations ] in that when the father had not received his son for DATE and the competent guardianship authority did not assist the enforcement , it did not take over the case . It is not an acceptable solution to settle cases that , instead of solving the professional problems , the second - instance guardianship authority repeatedly assigns new acting organ . This practice is unlawful ...", "It is indisputable that the first instance guardianship authority and the second instance guardianship authority made omissions DATE by not effectively promoting the enforcement of the contacts ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant initiated the review of the ORG \u2019s decision before ORG . On DATE this ORG established that the decision in question had been unlawful and informed the ORG about its findings .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the applicant was not able to exercise his access rights after the ORG \u2019s decision had been adopted . He initiated several enforcement proceedings , following which a few penalties in the sum of the statutory maximum were imposed on the mother .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant has been unable to have any contact with his son since then .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , as it had become impossible for the applicant to meet his child , he lodged a criminal complaint against the mother for endangering a minor , on DATE . ORG found the mother guilty and imposed a criminal fine on her on DATE . In its reasoning , the court emphasised that :", "\u201c [ a ] child \u2019s moral development can be endangered not only by so - called immoral conduct ... but also by depriving the child of the opportunity of healthy moral development . Thus , by the conduct of the mother , who , having knowledge of the fact DATE of which the child also had knowledge \u2013 that the father was to exercise his access rights at DATE , knowingly violated this right by organising for that date an attractive programme for the child in the countryside , at a location far from the father ... The mother involved the child in her conflict with the father , informed him of the court actions brought against or by him and made disparaging remarks about the father , thereby exerting emotionally negative influence on the child living under a common roof with her and thus being to an increased degree dependent on her . \u201d", "However , it also noted that the applicant :", "\u201c ... [ h]imself did not dispute that on certain occasions contact with the child became frustrated because of his own omission . \u201d", "CARDINAL . No further information was provided by the parties as to the development of the criminal case before the appellate court .", "CARDINAL . The relevant rules concerning the enforcement of contact orders can be found in Government Decree no . ORG ( ORG . CARDINAL . ) on ORG , which provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The development of the child is endangered if the parent ... wilfully and repeatedly fails to comply with a final contact order .", "( CARDINAL ) If non - compliance with the contact order on the part of the parent ... is a fault of his / her own , the guardianship authority shall warn him / her about the consequences of such conduct . The decision shall contain an injunction ordering the parent ... to terminate the unlawful conduct and a warning about the legal consequences of continuing the unlawful conduct .", "( CARDINAL ) If the measures provided for under subsection ( CARDINAL ) are of no effect and DATE has not elapsed from the receipt of the warning , the guardianship authority shall apply the rules governing enforcement of ORG with the exceptions set forth in this Decree .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) If the maintenance of contact entails conflicts , is continuously frustrated by obstacles , or there are disturbances in the communication between the parents [ in force since DATE ] , the guardianship authority may initiate the involvement of the child welfare service \u2019s contact centre , the ordering of taking the child into protection , or the institution of the child protection mediation procedure .", "( CARDINAL ) If it is proved that the parent ... brings up the child by continuously turning him / her against the person entitled to contact , and despite enforcement measures fails to comply with the contact order , an action to change custody may be brought before the court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , section CARDINAL of Act no . DATE on ORG provides for the possibility temporarily to place the child with the other parent living apart , if the child \u2019s emotional development is seriously threatened by his or her family environment and his or her immediate placement is necessary . Such serious threat may be established in case of risk of substantial and irreversible damage to the emotional development of the child .", "CARDINAL . Other measures at the authorities\u2019 disposal are listed in GPE , providing for police assistance for the enforcement of administrative decisions and the imposition of procedural fines ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
