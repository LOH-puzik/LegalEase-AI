In a decision of DATE , ORG for GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the refusal to authorise provisional placement of a child with a view to adoption . It did not call into question the fact that the applicant \u2019s educational qualities , based on love , respect and NORP values , were recognised . Moreover , the court considered that the applicant had sufficient resources as a result of her salaried jobs . It took the view , however , that the adoption of a second child could unfairly affect the situation of GPE . Moreover , it found that the applicant had underestimated the specific difficulties of adoption , and in particular international adoption . The court further expressed certain reservations about the applicant \u2019s availability and about the prospect of her father and brother being able to assist in caring for a second child . It thus concluded that the circumstances as a whole did not enable it to foresee that the adoption would further the child \u2019s welfare .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , notified to the applicant \u2019s representative on CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s administrative - law appeal , finding as follows :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . Under LAW in the version in force since DATE a child may be adopted if the future adoptive parents have cared for it and provided for its education for DATE , and if all the circumstances make it foreseeable that the establishment of a parent - child relationship will further the child \u2019s welfare without unfairly affecting the situation of any other children of the adoptive parents . All adoptions must thus be preceded by a placement and fostering relationship of a certain duration . An imperative condition for adoption , this measure serves to justify the subsequent establishment of a parent - child relationship , to allow a probationary period for those concerned , and to provide the opportunity and means to ensure that the adoption will further the child \u2019s welfare ( ORG [ ORG judgments ] CARDINAL III CARDINAL point CARDINAL p. CARDINAL and citations ) . Under LAW , the placement of children with foster parents is subject to the authorisation and supervision of the supervisory authority or another office for the place of residence of the said parents , as designated by cantonal law ( LAW ) ; where the child is placed with a view to its adoption , a single cantonal authority is competent ( LAW bis , as in force since DATE ) ; ORG stipulates the requirements for implementation ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "In accordance with Article ORG of ORG of DATE governing the placement of children for the purposes of support and with a view to adoption ( \u2018 the OPEE\u2019 ; RS CARDINAL ) , as in force since DATE , placement authorisation is given only where the personal qualities , state of health and educational capacities of the future adoptive parents and other persons living in their household , together with the housing conditions , offer every guarantee that the placed child will benefit from appropriate care , education and training , and that the well - being of the other children living in the family will be safeguarded ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) ) , that there is no statutory impediment to the future adoption and that all the circumstances put together , in particular the motives of the future adoptive parents , enable it to be foreseen that the adoption will further the child \u2019s welfare ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) ) . The authority must particularly take the child \u2019s interest into account where the age difference between the child and the adoptive parent is DATE ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) ORG ; see , on this issue , ORG CARDINAL III CARDINAL point CARDINAL p. CARDINAL ) .", "This primary condition of adoption \u2013 the welfare of the child ( LAW ) \u2013 is not easy to verify . The authority must ascertain whether the adoption is really capable of ensuring the best possible development of the child \u2019s personality and of improving his or her situation ; that question must be examined in all respects ( emotional , intellectual , physical ) , without attributing excessive weight to the material factor ( ATF CARDINAL III CARDINAL point QUANTITY in fine p. CARDINAL and citations ) .", "CARDINAL . Under Article CARDINALb \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code , an unmarried person DATE whether single , widowed or divorced DATE may adopt alone if he or she is DATE . In this form of adoption , the parent - child relationship is established with a single parent . As a result of that situation , the adoptive parent must , on his or her own , assume the duties that meet the child \u2019s needs and remain available to care for the child to a degree that exceeds that required of each parent in a couple adopting jointly . Accordingly , the authority must particularly take into account the child \u2019s interest where the applicant is not married , or where he or she is unable to adopt jointly with his or her spouse ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) ORG ) . The legislature \u2019s intention was that joint adoption should be the rule and adoption by a single parent the exception ( ORG CARDINAL II CARDINAL point CARDINAL p. CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It may indeed be considered that the child \u2019s interest , which is paramount , consists in principle of living in a complete family . Nevertheless , the law does expressly permit adoption by a single person , without subjecting him or her \u2013 unlike those wishing to adopt an adult or a person deprived of legal capacity ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL Chapter CARDINAL of LAW ) \u2013 to the existence of \u2018 valid reasons\u2019 . In any event , where the requisite conditions for the child \u2019s welfare are satisfied , and the adoption by a single person meets all the requirements for the child \u2019s fulfilment and personality development , the adoption will be granted ; in such cases , at the preliminary placement stage , the conditions laid down in LAW ORG will be satisfied , and the placement authorisation must be granted ( ATF CARDINAL III CARDINAL point CARDINAL p. CARDINAL and citations ) .", "CARDINAL . The court below found that the appellant had appropriate educational qualities . She can count on a wide network of persons who support her in her project and have promised to help her take care of the children when she is busy . Since the refusal of the authorities of the Canton of Jura ( see B.a above ) , she has changed the organisation of her life by moving to GPE , where she carries on her professional activities ; since DATE she has been renting accommodation in an area close to the parish church of which she is ma\u00eetre de chapelle and in a building that also houses the offices and secretariat of the music festival of which she is the artistic director . Lastly , her financial resources are sufficient ( MONEY ] DATE ) . Those points being established , it is not necessary to examine them again .", "CARDINAL . In her application of DATE the appellant had sought authorisation to receive \u2018 a second child , from LOC , aged DATE ; it does not appear from the application lodged DATE that those criteria had changed . However , when she appeared personally before the cantonal authority on DATE she declared that she wished to receive a child \u2018 up to the age of ORG ; pointing out that A. [ the first child adopted by the applicant ] was from GPE , she expressed a desire to be entrusted with a child who was \u2018 born in that ORG , whilst \u2018 of course remaining open to other PERSON .", "As this ORG found in a recent case , such an approach can not be admitted ( see judgment of CARDINAL of DATE , point CARDINAL , published in DATE p. CARDINAL ) . The home study report ( LAW and LAW is drawn up according to the age and origin of the child , factors that the applicant must indicate ( LAW ( a ) and ( c ) ORG ) . ORG thus quite rightly , in its findings on the cantonal appeal , found that this document had been \u2018 drawn up on the basis of an application for the adoption of a child aged DATE at the time of its arrival\u2019 . Any finding to the contrary would suggest that an application could be changed as and when the case so required , for a reduction of the age difference in this instance . It follows that the criticism of the cantonal court for not having granted an \u2018 authorisation for an older child , in order to reduce the age difference\u2019 appears ill - founded . The fact that the LAW between GPE and GPE on cooperation in matters of child adoption came into force while the case was pending on appeal , that is to say on DATE ( RO CARDINAL p. CARDINAL ) , is immaterial ; moreover , the appellant does not show that she would satisfy the conditions laid down in that agreement , or even \u2013 notwithstanding the opinion of ORG representative ( see record of individual hearing on DATE ) DATE that her project would in fact be feasible .", "CARDINAL . The appellant was born in DATE and is thus DATE ; in relation to a child of CARDINAL DATE leaving aside the waiting times in international adoption \u2013 the age difference would be between DATE and DATE . In the light of ORG case - law such a difference appears excessive ( see judgment CARDINAL of DATE , point CARDINAL , published in DATE p. CARDINAL : single person \u2018 of DATE wishing to adopt a \u2018 girl DATE ; see also the references cited in LAW point CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . As the cantonal authority rightly pointed out , even an age difference of DATE is too great . In that case the appellant would , at over DATE , find herself the single parent of CARDINAL teenagers , who , in addition to the problems arising in that period of life , may well face particular difficulties as adopted children ( see , for example , judgment CARDINAL of DATE , point CARDINAL , published in DATE p. CARDINAL ) , especially as the future child might have specific needs . The appellant is thus wrong to rely on ORG judgment CARDINAL III CARDINAL ( age difference between CARDINAL and forty - six years ) , where , moreover , the adoption of a single child was at stake ( see point QUANTITY below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The opinion of the court below , according to which the appellant underestimated the burden represented by a second child , can not be disputed . Whilst it may be admitted , from a theoretical standpoint , that the presence of a sister or brother may have beneficial effects in emotional and social terms ( see judgment CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , point CARDINAL , unpublished , in SJ CARDINAL pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) , that assessment should be nuanced as far as adopted children are concerned . The home study report noted that ORG , after enjoying exclusive maternal attention , faced the risk of \u2018 reactivating a feeling of abandonment\u2019 ; the positive effects of a new adoption on her situation ( LAW in fine of LAW , section GPE [ ORG LAW ] , and LAW ( a ) , in fine , ORG ) are not therefore certain ( see , in general , ORG , ORG de l\u2019enfant , GPE DATE , p. CARDINAL ; this author observes that \u2018 it is in families that have a number of adopted children or a number of biological children [ and CARDINAL adoptive child ] that the failure rate is the highest\u2019 ) . In addition , it can not be ruled out that the second child might have difficulties related to the deprivations suffered by children who have been abandoned ( judgment CARDINAL of DATE , point CARDINAL , published in DATE p. CARDINAL ) , and this might complicate the arrangements made by the appellant . These findings are consistent with those of ORG in its additional report of DATE .", "The appellant disputes that assessment ; she asserts , relying on statements from third parties , that the second adoption would be \u2018 beneficial for GPE and criticises the cantonal judges for straying into \u2018 theoretical GPE . Those criticisms appear unjustified . Given that the placement authorisation precedes the adoption decision , the authority must inevitably make a prognosis . In view of the characteristics of an adoption by a single person and the dramatic consequences that a failed adoption would have for the child ( see , on this subject , ORG in DATE pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) , the court below can not be reproached for its rigour ( see PERSON , op . cit . , n. CARDINAL ad LAW and the literature cited ) , as was in fact required of it by LAW of the ORG ( \u2018 most ORG ) . It is not for this ORG to substitute its own conception of the child \u2019s welfare for that of the cantonal authority and of the investigators ( see DATE p. CARDINAL , point CARDINAL in fine and citations ) , but solely to ascertain whether relevant circumstances have not been taken into consideration or , indeed , whether crucial factors have been overlooked . Notwithstanding the appellant \u2019s categorical denials , that is not the case here .", "CARDINAL . NORP The cantonal authority found that the assistance that the appellant \u2019s father could provide was not a solution for the care of A. and a second child ; the presence at home of an DATE father would represent , on the contrary , a handicap in the future , because his daughter would herself be required to provide him with help and support at some point . The appellant \u2019s brother , who has no children DATE and it is not known whether his wife has a professional activity \u2013 could admittedly help her with the future child , as he has already done with A. ; however , the brother lives in GPE . Similarly , the person intended to become the adopted child \u2019s godfather lives in GPE . Lastly , the support of neighbours in her building and of her very close friend , together with the presence of A. \u2019s godfather and godmother , does not change anything , as the important criterion is the availability of the appellant herself ; moreover , the education of children always rests with the parents , and it is easier to express an intention of assistance in the abstract context of a procedure than in everyday life and for DATE .", "This opinion is consistent with the case - law of this ORG and with legal opinion ( DATE p. CARDINAL point CARDINAL ; PERSON / PERSON , ORG filiation , vol . I , CARDINALrd ed . , no . CARDINAL , with other citations ) . Whatever the appellant may claim , the cantonal authority did not minimise the involvement of her family and friends by preferring \u2018 theoretical ORG . ORG had occasion to observe this in a recent case , where , in spite of her \u2018 extended family\u2019 , a mother applying for a second adoption had had to entrust her adopted daughter to a neighbour when she went into hospital ( DATE ibid . ) . As to the possibility of having to care for her father , she merely asserts that her brother \u2018 would be present\u2019 , but the latter has not corroborated this claim and in addition is supposed to make up for any deficiencies of the appellant . Moreover , the child \u2019s interest can not be measured solely in terms of the availability of the parent who is seeking to adopt alone ( PERSON / PERSON , ibid . ) . The grounds set out above are , in any event , sufficient for the decision appealed against to be upheld .", "CARDINAL . NORP In conclusion , having regard to the discretionary powers enjoyed by the placement authorities ( RDT CARDINAL p. CARDINAL point CARDINAL ) , the decision of the court below does not lay itself open to criticism . Accordingly , the appeal must be dismissed , with costs awarded against the appellant ( section CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Most NORP legislations authorise adoption by a single person . However , a number of different situations can be found . The legislative provisions of certain GPE permit any person , man or woman , with or without a precise indication of marital status , to apply for adoption . This is the case , in particular , for the following countries : GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , \u201c the former GPE \u201d , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . GPE , such as GPE or GPE , allow adoption by a single person subject to certain conditions . In NORP legislation , adoption is regarded as legitimate where it contributes to the child \u2019s physical and moral well - being and where the establishment of an effective parent - child relationship can be expected .", "CARDINAL . Other States impose restrictions on the adoption of a child by a single person . For example , in GPE and GPE , adoption by a single parent remains an exception . The possibility may be envisaged only if it can be shown that the adoption is in the child \u2019s interest ( in GPE and GPE ) . In the same vein , NORP and LOC legislations allow adoption by a single person only where there are sufficient reasons to justify it . GPE law draws a distinction between simple adoption ( which does not terminate the connection with the family of origin ) and full adoption ( which terminates all legal connection with the family of origin ) , stipulating that simple adoption alone , not full adoption , is possible for a single person . Unlike GPE and GPE , which also have such a distinction , but which nevertheless allow single persons to adopt in both cases , it is not possible in GPE or GPE for single persons to apply for full adoption .", "CARDINAL . NORP The NORP legislation is similar to that of GPE and GPE , as single persons are authorised to adopt minors only in the context of \u201c adoption in special circumstances \u201d . The definition of \u201c adoption in special circumstances \u201d corresponds to that of simple adoption , as it enables the adopted child to retain legal connections with his or her family of origin .", "CARDINAL . Most of the legislations of ORG member GPE require a minimum age for prospective adopters . That age continually decreased throughout DATE . The majority of NORP legal systems now fix a minimum age of DATE . GPE , \u201c the former GPE \u201d , GPE and GPE are among the rare member GPE that do not stipulate a minimum age for persons wishing to adopt .", "CARDINAL . Some legislations , albeit few in number , expressly provide for a maximum age for prospective adopters . For example , GPE , \u201c the former GPE \u201d , GPE , GPE , the GPE and GPE impose a maximum age of DATE ( for the latter limit , GPE and GPE in particular ) . Specific reasons may exceptionally justify non - observance of the maximum age rule . This is the case , for example , in GPE and the GPE , where an exemption from the maximum age requirement may be granted where there are sufficient reasons to justify such an exception or specific circumstances . In GPE and the \u201c the former GPE \u201d , when exemption from the maximum age is possible , an additional condition , relating to the difference in age between adopter and adoptee , is imposed .", "CARDINAL . In another group of GPE , where no maximum age is stipulated , the competent national authorities in the area of adoption nevertheless take into consideration the age of the person wishing to adopt when they examine his or her personal situation . This is apparent from the material available on the legal systems of GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the legislations of most member ORG also contain provisions concerning the age difference between adopter and adoptee .", "CARDINAL .

Some legislations set a maximum age difference between adopter and adoptee , namely DATE in GPE , GPE and the GPE ( in the latter , only for the adoption of foreign children ) , DATE in GPE , \u201c the former GPE \u201d , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , and DATE in GPE ; also , in exceptional circumstances , in GPE and GPE .
