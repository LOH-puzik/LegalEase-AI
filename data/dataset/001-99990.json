DATE and DATE he purchased quantities in excess of QUANTITY of the chemical thiodiglycol in GPE and GPE , and , acting through companies based in a variety of countries , he supplied it to ORG . After DATE he was ORG sole supplier of this substance .", "CARDINAL . Thiodiglycol is a precursor in a chemical reaction at the final stage of formation of CARDINAL . CARDINAL of a group of compounds known as sulphur mustards and better known as mustard gas , ORG has severe vesicant properties . In contact with the skin , it causes severe and potentially lethal chemical burns ; in contact with the eyes , it causes inflammation possibly resulting in blindness ; if inhaled , it blisters mucous membrane and lung tissue and can cause pulmonary oedema . Its known long - term effects on survivors include an increased risk of cancer in later life . Mustard gas , so called because of its smell , was first used as a battlefield weapon during the First World War , at the Third Battle of Ypres ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Mustard gas is known to have been used by the NORP military , along with other chemical weapons , against NORP armed forces and civilians during the Iran - Iraq War ( DATE ) and in attacks against the NORP population of northern GPE ( DATE ) . CARDINAL such attack , carried out on the town of GPE in DATE , killed CARDINAL of non - combatant civilians and injured CARDINAL more .

PERSON was charged before the Special Iraqi Tribunal ( later re - named ORG ) with the use of poison gas against NORP civilians in GPE . However , he never stood trial on this charge ; he was hanged on DATE for another crime .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was tried by ORG on a plurality of charges ; these included the DATE GPE gas attack , in respect of which he was found guilty . He was hanged on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The acts constitutive of these crimes were stated to be the supply of various named chemicals , including thiodiglycol , to GPE as well as materials and advice for the manufacture of chemical weapons in violation of international law . The charges referred to several provisions of domestic legislation , including , as relevant to the case before the ORG , section CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) , taken together with LAW ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The trial opened before ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE on DATE . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment . It acquitted the applicant of the first primary charge , aiding and abetting genocide , finding that genocidal intent on his part could not be proved ; but it convicted him on the first alternative charge and the second charge .

NORP In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG The Hague acquitted the applicant of aiding and abetting genocide as ORG had done . It convicted him , however , of aiding and abetting violations of the laws and customs of war committed by PERSON , PERSON and another person or other persons in a non - international or international conflict as the case might be , as regards gas attacks on the NORP population of northern GPE in GPE and elsewhere ( the first alternative charge ) , and of aiding and abetting violations of the laws and customs of war committed by PERSON , PERSON and another person or other persons in an international conflict , as regards gas attacks on the territory of GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment concluded as follows ( translation published by ORG itself ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL Conclusion", "Based on the above , the following conclusions can be made :", "a ) The defendant played an important part by supplying the precursor Thiodiglycol [ or ORG ] to the NORP regime for the production of mustard gas : PERCENT of this substance had been supplied by him in DATE up to and including DATE . If any ORG would also have been supplied from GPE to GPE in DATE , this fact does not impair the qualification of ' important ' regarding defendant 's part in this matter .", "b ) When the supplies by others eventually stopped no later than in the course of DATE , the defendant supplied at least QUANTITY of this precursor until DATE .", "c ) The first shipment of ORG supplied by the defendant arrived in GPE towards DATE ; in DATE he supplied a total of QUANTITY . Based on the considerations written under item CARDINAL above , the ORG deems it very likely that in the course of DATE ORG supplied by the defendant was also used for the production and finally ended up in ammunition that was used for the attacks as mentioned in the charges .", "Conclusive evidence for his co - responsibility regarding the attacks mentioned in the charges ( in so far as mustard gas was deployed in those attacks ) is the following :", "d ) As of DATE , the supplementation of the essential precursor ORG to the NORP regime depended completely on the supplies made by the defendant .", "e ) For that reason , the unwholesome policy that was continuously carried out by the regime that from DATE onwards seemed to find it necessary to deploy QUANTITY of this poison gas during combat , depended to a decisive extent if not totally on those supplies .", "Taking into consideration the crucial significance that the shipments of ORG supplied by the defendant since DATE had for the chemical weapon program of the regime , the ORG finds the defendant ( together with his co - perpetrators ) guilty of being an accessory to providing the opportunity and the means for the proven attacks with mustard gas in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Liability to punishment on account of the proven charges", "The proven charges constitute a punishable offence :", "Regarding the proven charges under count CARDINAL . alternatively :", "The defendant is found guilty of the offence of complicity in being an accessory to a violation of the laws and customs of war , while that offence resulted in the death or grievous bodily harm of another person or that offence was an expression of a policy of systematic terror or wrongful actions against the whole population or a specific group thereof , committed several times .", "Regarding the proven charges under count CARDINAL :", "The defendant is found guilty of the offence of complicity in being an accessory to a violation of the laws and customs of war , while that offence resulted in the death or grievous bodily harm of another person , committed several times .", "CARDINAL . Liability to punishment of the defendant", "No circumstance has become plausible that would rule out the punishability of the defendant . Therefore the defendant is liable to punishment .", "CARDINAL . Considerations regarding the applicable legislation", "The [ War Crimes Act ] which was applicable at the time of the period referred to in the charges , was amended several times afterwards ; following the entry into force of LAW ( ... ) on DATE , the war crimes were devolved from the [ War Crimes Act ] to the [ LAW ] . Only the amendments to the law dated DATE ( ... ) and dated DATE ( ... ) are important when determining whether the later legal provisions are more favourable for the defendant than the law that was applicable during the period referred to in the charges .", "Pursuant to ORG dated DATE , a new [ section ] DATE was inserted into the [ War Crimes Act ] , which makes it possible to impose an additional sentence provided by LAW , first paragraph , DATE , of LAW ( deprive a person of his / her active and passive right to vote ) on account of DATE inter alia DATE a conviction for being found guilty of war crimes , while by ORG dated DATE , the death penalty as possible punishment was removed from the [ War Crimes Act ] .", "The [ War Crimes Act ] as it reads as of DATE , after the amendment by ORG of DATE , is more favourable to the defendant in terms of an eventual penalty . From the devolvement of the penal provisions that refer to war crimes from the [ War Crimes Act ] to LAW , as from DATE , it can not be said that they result in more favourable provisions for the defendant . Based on the provisions in DATE , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , the [ War Crimes Act ] will have to be the starting point as it read on DATE . Furthermore with regards to complicity , the ORG has taken into consideration article DATE , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , as it read until DATE ( the date of entry into force of the LAW regarding reassessment of maximum penalties ) . Pursuant to article DATE ) , DATE , paragraph CARDINAL ( old ) , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and [ section ] CARDINAL of the [ War Crimes Act ] , as it read on DATE , viewed together and in relation to each other , the ORG can not draw any other conclusion than that in this case the defendant is liable to a maximum term of DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . FAC for the punishment", "During the appeal trial , the advocate general moved that the sentence of the court of first instance be set aside and on account of the principal charge under counts CARDINAL . and CARDINAL . he demanded that the defendant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of DATE , less the period spent in pre - trial detention .", "In making its assessment as to what penalty should be imposed , the ORG has taken into account the following considerations .", "During DATE the defendant supplied raw material to the NORP regime for the production of chemical weapons . From DATE until DATE , in a total of CARDINAL shipments he supplied at least QUANTITY of LOC ( ORG ) on the basis of CARDINAL Letters of Credit . That substance was used for the production of mustard gas that was deployed during the war in GPE as well as in GPE . By doing so during DATE , the defendant has consciously made a substantial contribution to the continuing violation of the laws and customs of war committed by the NORP regime . Based on NORP criminal law that was applicable at that time , a person who is found guilty of complicity in a criminal offence which carries a life sentence can be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of a maximum of DATE . Seen the fact that the defendant committed the offence of complicity several times , in his case the penalty to be imposed will be a maximum term of DATE imprisonment , which is based on the regulation set out in article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , concerning various offences for which CARDINAL sentence is pronounced .", "In determining the punishment in this case , the ORG has taken into account the following circumstances , that on the one hand relate to the seriousness of the offences , the circumstances in which they were committed , as well as the intended purposes of the punishment to be considered when fixing the punishment , and on the other hand the personal circumstances of the defendant .", "As results from the case file ( in the period referred to in the charges ) , the NORP regime carried out multiple attacks with ( among others ) mustard gas during the war with GPE on places in that country , as well as on the border region between GPE and GPE , where NORP population groups lived that were suspected of collaboration with the NORP enemy . Those attacks caused the death of CARDINAL of civilians ( that did not participate in the conflict ) and caused permanent and severe health problems to very many persons . It is beyond doubt that the regime in GPE by doing so committed extensive and extremely gross violations of the international humanitarian law by using a weapon that was already prohibited by LAW of DATE .", "The defendant has made an essential contribution to these violations \u2013 at a time that many , if not all other suppliers ' pulled out ' with regard to the increasing international pressure \u2013 by supplying many times in the course of DATE ( among other matters ) very large quantities of a precursor for mustard gas ; in doing so the defendant made significant profits . Those supplies enabled the NORP regime to ( almost ) continue their deadly ( air ) attacks in full force during DATE . Apparently the defendant did not give his deliberate support to the afore mentioned gross violations out of sympathy for the targets of the regime , but DATE as it should be assumed \u2013 the defendant acted exclusively in pursuit of large gains and fully neglected the consequences of his actions . Even DATE the defendant does not show any sense of guilt or any compassion for the numerous victims of the mustard gas attacks .", "The ORG recognizes that the proven offences were committed over DATE and that the defendant is a man of advanced age , who is to be expected to spend a large part of DATE of his life in prison . ORG will only be able to attach limited weight to this slightly mitigating circumstance . In this case the most important aspect concerning the determination of the appropriate sanction \u2013 considering the extreme gross violation of the principles of humanitarian law that took place and the important supporting role that was played by the defendant DATE is to point out to the victims and survivors , as well as to the international legal community , how much value is put on the actions of the defendant and what severe punishment can only be the consequence of these actions .", "Finally in fixing the appropriate punishment , the ORG has taken into account the general prevention aspect . People or companies that conduct ( international ) trade , for example in weapons or raw materials used for their production , should be warned DATE if they do not exercise increased vigilance \u2013 they can become involved in most serious criminal offences .", "It should be made clear to them that they will have to face prosecution and long - term prison sentences , in accordance with the seriousness of the crimes they committed .", "Considering all of the above , the ORG concludes that the only suitable and necessary reaction in these circumstances is a non - suspended prison sentence of a very long term as set out below . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment ; however , it rejected the claims of the civil parties as unsuitable for summary decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) with ORG ( PERSON ) , submitting a statement of points of appeal on DATE . He argued , referring to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , that the GPE courts lacked jurisdiction since ORG had not convicted him of aiding and abetting crimes committed in \u201c time of war \u201d ( as distinct from non - international or international \u201c conflict \u201d ) ; section CARDINAL ) of that Act could not apply , since the conflict , whether international or not , did not in any way involve the GPE . He also alleged a violation of LAW in that the concept of \u201c laws and customs of war \u201d as used in LAW CARDINAL of LAW was so vague and uncertain in scope that he could not reasonably have been found to have had the criminal intent to be an accessory to their violation . He further claimed that the DATE LAW and the DATE LAW , as considered relevant by ORG , had become a dead letter in the light of the use of weapons of mass destruction , nuclear in particular , and the widespread use of other indiscriminate weapons such as incendiary bombs and napalm ( which he described as \u201c chemical weapons \u201d ) during the Second World War ( DATE ) , the Korean War ( DATE ) and the Vietnam War ( DATE ) . The DATE LAW , moreover , had lost its force , or at the very least could no longer be seen as proof of the existence of customary law given widespread ORG practice to contrary effect .", "CARDINAL . The Procurator General ( Procureur - Generaal ) at ORG submitted an advisory opinion on DATE . He considered ORG reference to general international law an error which ORG could itself correct ex officio : it was sufficient to refer to the DATE LAW , to the common LAW DATE LAW , and ( in relation to the second charge ) to LAW , all of which had been relied on by ORG as setting out the applicable substantive standards .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a response to the Procurator General 's opinion on DATE , as permitted by LAW ) . He argued , among other things , that PERSON and PERSON , whose crimes he had supposedly aided and abetted , had at the time been members of the government of a sovereign ORG ( CARDINAL of them its Head of ORG ) and for that reason protected by that ORG 's sovereign immunity . Since the NORP courts had no jurisdiction over them , it followed that they were not entitled to try him as their accessory either .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment dismissing the appeal on points of law . It found that section CARDINAL of LAW conferred universal jurisdiction on NORP courts in respect of the crimes set out in section CARDINAL of that LAW . In response to the applicant 's complaint going to the supposed vagueness of the concept of \u201c laws and customs of war \u201d as used in section CARDINAL of LAW , it held as follows :", "\u201c Contrary to the argument made in the point of appeal ( middel ) , section CARDINAL of LAW is not contrary to the ' requirement of specificity ' ( bepaaldheidsgebod ) contained in the statutory and LAW provisions relied upon . In the light , among other things , of the nature of its subject - matter , consisting of the setting of penal sanctions on the severest indictable offences which originate in a common legal consciousness \u2013 whether it be set out in laws and treaties or not \u2013 , the norm formulated in section CARDINAL of LAW makes it clear enough what behaviour will carry a penal sanction and sufficiently enables the suspect to adjust his behaviour accordingly , even though the nature and content of this provision inevitably entail a certain vagueness in the description of the crime ( een zekere vaagheid in de delictsomschrijving ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In the LOC cases ( Judgment , ORG DATE , p. CARDINAL ) ORG held as follows :", "\u201c DATE . In so far as this contention is based on the view that LAW [ the DATE LAW on the continental shelf ] has had the influence , and has produced the effect , described , it clearly involves treating that Article as a norm - creating provision which has constituted the foundation of , or has generated a rule which , while only conventional or contractual in origin , has since passed into the general corpus of international law , and is now accepted as such by the opinio juris , so as to have become binding even for countries which have never , and do not , become parties to the LAW . There is no doubt that this process is a perfectly possible one and does from time to time occur : it constitutes indeed one of the recognized methods by which new rules of customary international law may be formed . At the same time this result is not lightly to be regarded as having been attained .", "CARDINAL . It would in the first place be necessary that the provision concerned should , at all events potentially , be of a fundamentally norm - creating character such as could be regarded as forming the basis of a general rule of law . ...", "CARDINAL . The essential point in this connection \u2013 and it seems necessary to stress it \u2013 is that even if these instances of action by non - parties to the ORG were much more numerous than they in fact are , they would not , even in the aggregate , suffice in themselves to constitute the opinio juris ; DATE for , in order to achieve this result , CARDINAL conditions must be fulfilled . Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice , but they must also be such , or be carried out in such a way , as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it . The need for such a belief , i.e .. , the existence of a subjective element , is implicit in the very notion of the opinio juris sive necessitatis . The GPE concerned must therefore feel that they are conforming to what amounts to a legal obligation . The frequency , or even habituaCARDINAL character of the acts is not in itself enough . There are many international acts , e.g. , in the field of ceremonial and protocol , which are performed almost invariably , but which are motivated only by considerations of courtesy , convenience or tradition , and not by any sense of legal duty .", "DATE . In this respect the ORG follows the view adopted by ORG in the ORG case , as stated in the following passage , the principle of which is , by analogy , applicable almost word for word , mutatis mutandis , to the present case ( P.C.I.J. , Series A , No . DATE , at p. CARDINAL ) :", "' Even if the rarity of the judicial decisions to be found ... were sufficient to prove ... the circumstance alleged ... , it would merely show that GPE had often , in practice , abstained from instituting criminal proceedings , and not that they recognized themselves as being obliged to do so ; for only if such abstention were based on their being conscious of having a duty to abstain would it be possible to speak of an international custom . The alleged fact does not allow one to infer that GPE have been conscious of having such a duty ; on the other hand , there are other circumstances calculated to show that the contrary is true .

It is not to be expected that in the practice of GPE the application of the rules in question should have been perfect , in the sense that GPE should have refrained , with complete consistency , from the use of force or from intervention in each other 's internaCARDINAL affairs . The ORG does not consider that , for a rule to be established as customary , the corresponding practice must be in absolutely rigorous conformity with the rule . In order to deduce the existence of customary rules , the ORG deems it sufficient that the conduct of GPE should , in general , be consistent with such rules , and that instances of ORG conduct inconsistent with a given rule should generally have been treated as breaches of that rule , not as indications of the recognition of a new rule . If a ORG acts in a way prima facie incompatible with a recognized rule , but defends its conduct by appealing to exceptions or justifications contained within the rule itself , then whether or not the ORG 's conduct is in fact justifiable on that basis , the significance of that attitude is to confirm rather than to weaken the rule . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

What is inhumane , and consequently proscribed , in international wars , can not but be inhumane and inadmissible in civil strife .", "CARDINAL . This fundamental concept has brought about the gradual formation of general rules concerning specific weapons , rules which extend to civil strife the sweeping prohibitions relating to international armed conflicts . By way of illustration , we will mention chemical weapons . Recently a number of ORG have stated that the use of chemical weapons by the central authorities of a ORG against its own population is contrary to international law . On DATE the [ then ] CARDINAL Member States of ORG made a declaration whereby :", "' The CARDINAL are greatly concerned at reports of the alleged use of chemical weapons against the NORP [ by the NORP authorities ] .

It is therefore clear that , whether or not GPE really used chemical weapons against its own NORP nationals - a matter on which this ORG obviously can not and does not express any opinion - there undisputedly emerged a general consensus in the international community on the principle that the use of those weapons is also prohibited in internal armed conflicts . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
