The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was interviewed by officers of ORG in connection with allegations of market rigging , theft and false accounting , alleged to have taken place in the course of the takeover of CARDINAL company by the company in which the applicant , a chartered accountant , was involved . The alleged offences took place during DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was further interviewed on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , and was formally charged on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s trial began in DATE and on DATE , after a trial lasting DATE , the applicant was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and CARDINAL counts of theft . The proceedings were adjourned for pre - sentence reports , and on DATE the applicant was ordered to perform TIME community service . He was also ordered to pay compensation of ORG CARDINAL within DATE , with DATE imprisonment in default , and was further ordered to pay GBP CARDINAL towards prosecution costs .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a notice of appeal against conviction on DATE , and on CARDINAL DATE , the Attorney General made a reference to ORG for a review of the applicant \u2019s sentence under Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE . In DATE , the applicant was refused legal aid on financial grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , privately represented , submitted perfected grounds of appeal and his response to the Attorney General \u2019s reference . Leave to appeal against conviction was granted on DATE . A request for the legal aid position to be reconsidered was refused by a single judge in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , after a summary of the case had been prepared by ORG , the case was sent to ORG , and on DATE the hearing dates were fixed with counsel \u2019s clerks .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney General served an amended Section CARDINAL reference .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's appeal against conviction was dismissed by ORG on DATE , and on DATE , the Attorney General 's reference was heard by ORG . ORG found as follows :", "\u201c We grant leave in respect of each of these applications , as we consider the sentence imposed by Judge PERSON in respect of each of the defendants was unduly lenient . ( \u2026 )", "Much has been said about the delay in this case . It does indeed seem a very long time . But it has to be borne in mind that much of the delay in the hearing of these applications has resulted from the fact that CARDINAL of the defendants chose , as was their right , to appeal against conviction .", "We regard conduct of the sort involved here , that is to say working to create a false market in shares in companies involved in a GPE takeover , and in order to influence the fate of that takeover , as a very serious matter . Not only may it lead to a fraud on shareholders , but it causes considerable damage to the reputation of GPE , which is very important to the whole country ; and damage to the confidence of the public in its institutions .", "We consider it very unlikely , therefore , that when such conduct comes before the courts for sentence that a Community Service Order could ever be sufficient punishment . We have no hesitation in concluding that it was inappropriate , that is to say too lenient , in respect of the conduct in this case . True no actual false market was created , but it was not for want of trying . ( \u2026 )", "Dealing first with [ Mr X ] . We view him as the instigator and leader of the operation . In our judgment , the right sentence which should have been passed on him by a trial judge upon conviction , additional to compensation and the costs order , was DATE imprisonment . We now start by taking into account that he did serve the period of community service that he was called upon to serve , and served it well apparently . Next we deduct from the sentence what has come to be known as the \u2018 discount for double jeopardy\u2019 . After those deductions , we arrive at a sentence , to run from DATE , of DATE imprisonment . We further disqualify him from holding a directorship of a public company for DATE from DATE .", "Turning to [ the applicant ] . He was an active and powerful second in command . The right sentence in his case , we believe , would have been CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . Again we do the discounting that we did in the case of [ Mr X ] ; and we arrive at a sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , starting from DATE . We disqualify him from holding a directorship in a public company for DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The compensation and costs orders remained . The applicant had already completed the community service to which he had originally been sentenced .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the general regime of appeals against decisions of ORG , the Attorney General may , in certain circumstances and where it appears to him that a sentence of ORG has been unduly lenient , apply to ORG for leave to refer the case to it to review the sentence . The principal relevant provisions are to be found in LAW of LAW DATE . An application for leave must be made within DATE of the sentence . Where the Court of Appeal grants leave , it will consider a sentence \u201c unduly lenient \u201d where \u201c it falls outside the range of sentences which the judge , applying his mind to all the relevant factors , could reasonably consider appropriate \u201d ( Attorney General \u2019s Reference No . DATE , Cr . App . PERSON ) CARDINAL ) . ORG has also commented that \u201c before this ORG granted an application of this sort , it must be shown that there was some error in principle in the judge \u2019s sentence ... that in the absence of a sentence being altered by this ORG , public confidence would be damaged ... the ORG should only grant leave in exceptional circumstances , and not in the borderline type of case \u201d ( Attorney General \u2019s Reference No .
