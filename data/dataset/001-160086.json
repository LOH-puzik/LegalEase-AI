On CARDINAL DATE a businessman , ORG , was killed in the heart of GPE , near the building that houses ORG , when a bomb detonated under his car . The crime received much media coverage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after being accused of having been involved in ORG \u2019s killing , a certain PERSON stated in his testimony that he had received the order to murder ORG from a certain ORG , but he did not know whether it was ORG who had wished to murder ORG , or whether the contract had been put out by someone else .", "On DATE PERSON changed his testimony , stating that the contract to murder ORG had been put out by \u2018 Alius from PERSON .", "On DATE G.B. showed the investigators the place where he claimed to have met \u2018 Alius\u2019 in DATE . This was near the applicant \u2019s home address in GPE .", "CARDINAL . From this point in time , the prosecutor began to suspect that the applicant , who had a previous conviction dating from DATE , had been involved in ORG \u2019s murder . The prosecutor gathered information about the applicant \u2019s property and obtained the applicant \u2019s telephone number , which in turn linked him to CARDINAL of the suspects in ORG \u2019s murder .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG convicted CARDINAL individuals who had acted together in an armed gang in GPE and its surroundings from DATE . The members of this criminal organisation were convicted of CARDINAL murders and CARDINAL attempted murders that involved the use of firearms and explosives , as well as a number of robberies and kidnappings of businesspeople .", "By the same judgment , CARDINAL individuals belonging to that criminal association , GPE , GPE and GPE , were convicted of R.G.s murder . The court established that it had been a contract killing , ordered because an unidentified person was unwilling to repay a considerable sum of money to ORG The court also established that the unidentified person was known under the alias \u201c Alius \u201d . The fifth person involved in the murder , ORG , was in hiding . PERSON was sentenced to a total of DATE imprisonment for all the crimes concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of ORG testimony , the prosecutor concluded that it was likely that \u201c Alius \u201d was in fact the applicant . PERSON also testified on unknown date that he would recognise \u201c Alius \u201d if he saw him . DATE the prosecutor ordered the GPE organised crime police to establish the applicant \u2019s place of residence , to obtain his telephone records and to examine his links with ORG", "CARDINAL . On DATE photographs of CARDINAL individuals were shown to PERSON , who at that time was already serving a prison sentence . PERSON identified the applicant as \u2018 Alius from PERSON \u2013 the person who had put out the murder contract .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE organised crime police informed the prosecutor in writing that the applicant was not living in the apartment where he was registered in GPE . The police admitted that they could not locate the applicant but undertook to notify the prosecutor of the applicant \u2019s whereabouts as soon as they found him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor concluded that there was sufficient evidence to charge the applicant with having organised ORG \u2019s murder and issued a decision charging the applicant with that crime ( nutarimas patraukti kaltinamuoju ) . The decision gave an account of the facts as construed by the prosecutor and contained a detailed description of the crime , including the time - frame , the links between the applicant , those convicted ( PERSON , GPE and GPE ) and ORG , and the sums of money paid for its execution . The decision did not contain any references to evidence against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the prosecutor instituted a search for the applicant and ordered GPE organised crime police to conduct it . The prosecutor also addressed a request to ORG that the applicant be detained once arrested . Taking into account the fact that the crime could attract a life sentence , and given that at that specific time the applicant could not be located , the prosecutor took the view that it was likely that the applicant had fled from justice . The evidence against the applicant was \u201c his GPE testimony and his being recognised as the organiser of the crime [ by the accomplices ] \u201d . DATE , ORG authorised the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention in absentia .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor asked ORG organised crime police whether the applicant had been found . From the documents before the ORG it appears that the GPE organised crime police informed their colleagues in GPE on DATE that the applicant \u2019s place of residence was not known .", "CARDINAL . NORP Over DATE , on DATE , the prosecutor issued a NORP Arrest Warrant in respect of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE GPE organised crime police informed the prosecutor where the applicant could be found and the prosecutor ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on DATE in GPE . The applicant \u2019s temporary arrest record ( \u012ftariamojo laikino sulaikymo protokolas ) stated that the applicant had been arrested in the context of a criminal investigation on suspicion of having organised ORG \u2019s murder . The record referred to the court decision of DATE ordering the applicant \u2019s detention , to ORG , and to the applicant \u2019s prior conviction of DATE for a property - related crime . The record also stated that the applicant had been hiding from the prosecutor for a long time . The applicant signed the record of his arrest and the prosecutor \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE charging him with having organised ORG \u2019s murder ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE , that is to say on DATE , the prosecutor issued a notice of suspicion ( prane\u0161imas apie \u012ftarim\u0105 ) which repeated the prosecutor \u2019s account of the facts surrounding ORG \u2019s murder , as described in the decision of DATE charging him with the crime ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . No evidence was referred to in the notice of suspicion , which the applicant and his lawyer signed .", "DATE the applicant was shown the prosecutor \u2019s decision charging him with ORG \u2019s murder of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant was questioned . Of the CARDINAL people convicted of ORG \u2019s murder , he admitted to knowing only ORG The applicant denied any involvement in the car bombing and stated that he would not testify without his lawyer . The applicant then signed a record of questioning of a suspect ( \u012ftariamojo apklausos protokolas ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the record of case file material shown to the lawyer ( gyn\u0117jo supa\u017eindinimo su bylos med\u017eiaga protokolas ) dated DATE , the prosecutor provided the applicant \u2019s lawyer , at his request , with the following documents from the case file :", "CARDINAL ) NORP the applicant \u2019s temporary arrest record of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP the decision to charge the applicant of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP the notice of suspicion of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; and", "CARDINAL ) NORP the record of questioning of a suspect of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the prosecutor submitted to the Vilnius City Second District Court a written request for the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial ( parei\u0161kimas skirti su\u0117mim\u0105 ) . The request contained the prosecutor \u2019s account of the crime , as described in the decision charging the applicant and the notice of suspicion ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . It mentioned that the evidence linking the applicant to ORG \u2019s murder was witnesses\u2019 and other ORG testimony , the records of the applicant \u2019s identification ( parodym\u0173 atpa\u017einti protokolai ) , records of searches and other factual data . The document did not explain any particular piece of evidence against the applicant . As grounds for detention the prosecutor cited the fact that the applicant had been hiding from the prosecutor for DATE , the European Arrest Warrant , the applicant \u2019s prior conviction , the severity of the penalty that the crime of murder could attract \u2012 which could in itself prompt the applicant to flee \u2012 and the need to carry out more investigative steps . The request did not mention the risk that the applicant might try to influence witnesses as one of the grounds for his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Vilnius City Second District Court held a hearing in the presence of the prosecutor , the applicant and the applicant \u2019s lawyer .", "As the record of the hearing shows , at the start thereof the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked the court to view the evidential material from the pre - trial investigation , on the basis of which his client was being detained . The lawyer admitted that he had been able to acquaint himself with the prosecutor \u2019s request to the court for the applicant \u2019s detention ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the record of the applicant \u2019s questioning and the notice of suspicion , but no other material had been made available to him , even though ORG guidelines require otherwise ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The lawyer contended that the information shown to him was not sufficient to understand what basis there was , firstly , for suspecting the applicant of ORG \u2019s murder and , secondly , for detaining him . The lawyer insisted that he had a right to consult the material in the case file , which the prosecutor had provided to the court for the purposes of ascertaining whether it was reasonable to detain his client .", "CARDINAL . In reply , the prosecutor submitted that \u201c in this case the applicant \u2019s lawyer had been shown what was necessary ( \u0161iuo atveju gyn\u0117jas supa\u017eindintas tiek , kiek reikia ) \u201d . Moreover , in accordance with LAW , pre - trial investigation material was not to be made public . In the instant case , the applicant was not permitted to see the entire case file because doing so could have prejudiced the success of the pre - trial investigation . The grounds for detaining the applicant were that a search for him had been conducted [ since DATE ] , and a NORP Arrest Warrant had been issued in respect of him . The record of the hearing also indicates that the prosecutor then submitted \u201c to the court the pre - trial investigation file concerning the applicant and the reasonableness of his detention . The court examined the material provided by the prosecutor and , having evaluated it , decided that the lawyer \u2019s request to see the said material was to be denied , since to disclose it could be detrimental to effective investigation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . When questioned at the court hearing , the applicant acknowledged that he knew ORG However , he denied knowing PERSON , GPE and GPE , the people already convicted of ORG \u2019s murder . The applicant also maintained that he had never had the nickname \u201c Alius \u201d . He admitted that his wife lived in GPE and that he was wealthy . The applicant and his lawyer contended that the applicant had never been summoned for questioning , nor had he been hiding from the investigators : after DATE he had renewed his identity documents , had crossed the State border , had taken part in car rally competitions , winning the President \u2019s cup in DATE , and had even been elected president of the NORP rally committee .", "CARDINAL . The Vilnius City Second District Court decided to grant the prosecutor \u2019s request for the applicant \u2019s detention . In the operative part of its ruling , having summarised the arguments put forward by the prosecutor and the defence , the court noted that the case file material showed that the applicant was suspected of a very serious crime for which life imprisonment could be imposed . The applicant \u2019s wife was living abroad and this could prompt the applicant to flee from justice . It was also pertinent that there were discrepancies in the [ witnesses\u2019 ] testimony given to the investigators . There was thus reason to believe that \u201c the applicant might attempt to influence participants in the criminal proceedings ( those convicted , witnesses , others ) and to destroy evidence \u201d if left at liberty . A number of investigative steps still had to be carried out . Lastly , there was reason to believe that the applicant might commit new crimes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON attended an identity parade that included the suspect and , in a CARDINAL - man line - up , identified the applicant as \u2018 ORG , naming him as the person who had ordered ORG \u2019s murder . In accordance with the requirements of LAW , the applicant \u2019s lawyer was present when PERSON identified his client .", "CARDINAL . G.B. was questioned by the prosecutor on DATE , and testified in writing that after he had identified the applicant , on DATE he had been approached by another prisoner . Due to the relations prevailing in the prison , PERSON preferred not to name that other prisoner . PERSON stated that the other prisoner had told him that he had received a request from \u201c the outside world ( i\u0161 laisv\u0117s ) \u201d and from \u201c the underworld of GPE ( ORG nusiklastamo pasaulio ) \u201d to ask PERSON , in return for CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL ) , not to identify the applicant as the person who had put out the contract on ORG To that PERSON replied that it was too late , because he had already identified the applicant . The other prisoner stated that in that case he would have to further consult those who had made the proposition .", "DATE , on CARDINAL or DATE , the same prisoner had made a new proposition : PERSON should write a statement to the effect that he had been mistaken when identifying the applicant on DATE . PERSON also was told that the applicant \u2019s lawyers were considering challenging the lawfulness of the identity parade procedure . The sum allegedly offered to the applicant for changing his prior testimony stayed the same . At that time PERSON also stated that he had not been the target of any threats for testifying against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer submitted an appeal to ORG against the court order of CARDINAL DATE for the detention of his client . The lawyer complained that the judge had not allowed him to see the case file and maintained that the procedure had therefore not been adversarial . The lawyer acknowledged that the applicant had a prior conviction , but that had been DATE . The applicant \u2019s lawyer also asked the court to view G.B. \u2019s testimony in a critical light , given that the latter , as a convicted person , could have his own reasons for incriminating the applicant . Furthermore , the prosecutor had not provided any factual data endorsing his suspicion that the applicant might attempt to influence witnesses . As far as the lawyer understood it , all the witnesses with knowledge of ORG \u2019s murder had been isolated from society and there was no real possibility of influencing them . Furthermore , if anyone had wished to pervert the course of justice , he or she would have done it at some time during DATE that had elapsed since the crime . Now there would be no sense in doing that . In support of his claims that it was safe to leave the applicant at liberty , his lawyer provided the court with documents about his client \u2019s family and work situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The prosecutor and the applicant \u2019s lawyer were present at that hearing .", "The court accepted that factual material incriminating the applicant existed in the form of ORG testimony , the record showing that PERSON had recognised the applicant , both from photographs and in person . The court also noted that , according to the information which had been provided to it , the search for the applicant had gone on for a long time , that he had connections abroad , and that LAW had been issued in his regard . The seriousness of the crime of which he was suspected was also a factor in the establishment of grounds for detaining him .", "However , the appellate court noted \u201c the absence of any well - founded evidence ( pagr\u012fst\u0173 \u012frodym\u0173 ) in the case file indicating that the applicant might attempt , either himself or through third parties , to influence witnesses , victims , people already convicted or other individuals , or that he would attempt to destroy evidence \u201d . Keeping him detained merely because the pre - trial investigators had not yet collected all the material necessary to build the case did not constitute valid grounds for such detention either . The existence of discrepancies in the testimonies ( byloje u\u017efiksuot\u0173 parodym\u0173 nenuoseklumas ) could not be blamed on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . During a face - to - face confrontation ( akistata ) held on DATE , PERSON reaffirmed his testimony that it was the applicant who had put out the contract for ORG \u2019s murder .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was extended on CARDINAL DATE and again on DATE . His lawyers and the prosecutor were present at those hearings . The courts noted that the grounds for detention were the search for the applicant , LAW , his previous conviction and the fact that he had been charged with a serious crime for which a severe sentence could be imposed . In one of these QUANTITY rulings the court also noted that PERSON , who was CARDINAL of those already convicted for the DATE car bombing , had identified the applicant as the person who had put out the contract on ORG", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor questioned PERSON \u2019s wife . She testified that she had known that her husband was a witness in the criminal case concerning ORG \u2019s murder . She stated that her husband had told her that he had received threats directed at him and his family for having given evidence , and had warned his wife to be careful . She also stated that from DATE she and her daughter had received telephone calls from unknown men asking if they could meet and talk , which she had refused to do . She also testified that on DATE she had found a funeral wreath in front of the entrance door to the caf\u00e9 she owned . She understood this gesture to be a veiled threat to PERSON \u2019s family should he not change his testimony .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG further extended the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial . Having reaffirmed the aforementioned grounds for keeping the applicant detained , including the argument that he had been evading justice ever since DATE , ORG also noted evidence that the applicant had tried , through third parties , to influence the witness PERSON and his family so that PERSON would not testify against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of having put out the contract for ORG \u2019s murder . In finding against the applicant , the trial court relied on the testimony of G.B. Even though the applicant denied his involvement in the crime and insisted that PERSON was slandering him , the trial court observed that PERSON \u2019s testimony to the effect that the crime had been organised by a certain \u201c Alius \u201d had been consistent ever since PERSON was first questioned during the pre - trial investigation in DATE . Moreover , PERSON had recognised the applicant from photographs on DATE and during a police identity line - up on DATE . Other evidence against the applicant also included the testimony of CARDINAL further witnesses DATE namely the applicant \u2019s and ORG \u2019s former business partners , a police officer , and the brother of ORG \u2019s widow . Telephone records also showed that in DATE and DATE numerous conversations had taken place between the applicant , ORG , ORG and ORG In addition , extracts from the bank accounts of the applicant \u2019s company , customs declarations , and documents from GPE municipality illustrated the financial dealings between the applicant and ORG", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that DATE had passed since the crime was committed . The applicant had not been hiding during that time , even though a search for him \u201c without reason ( nepagr\u012fsta ) \u201d had been called for . In DATE the applicant had not once broken the law and there was no information in the case file indicating his involvement in organised crime . Moreover , the applicant had worked , supported his family , including CARDINAL children who were minors , and had participated in public life . However , given the seriousness of the crime , the court held that the applicant still posed a danger to society . The court lastly found that because of the pre - trial investigation ORG fault the applicant was being punished only after DATE had passed since the crime . To impose a very severe sentence on him would therefore be unjust . CARDINAL years\u2019 deprivation of liberty in a correctional home would be appropriate . The time which the applicant had spent in pre - trial detention DATE from DATE until DATE was to be counted towards that period .", "CARDINAL . An appeal having been lodged against this verdict , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant was acquitted by ORG . The court found the testimony of PERSON who was the main witness for the prosecution \u2212 against the applicant , including testimony given on site in DATE , PERSON \u2019s recognising the applicant in the police identity line - up and the testimony given the face - to - face confrontation to be inconsistent , not credible and contradictory of other evidence in the case ( nelogi\u0161ki , prie\u0161taraujantys kitiems \u012frodymams ir nenuosekl\u016bs ) . There was a real possibility that by giving such testimony PERSON had sought to improve his position . In this connection ORG also noted that PERSON had attempted to diminish his own role in ORG \u2019s murder . It was for that reason that , on DATE , ORG had dismissed the prosecutor \u2019s and PERSON \u2019s plea for mitigation of PERSON \u2019s sentence on the basis of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG also emphasised that there was not sufficient additional evidence to link the applicant to crime .", "ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release from detention . He had to stay at his place of residence , and his travel documents were taken from him .", "CARDINAL . The decision to acquit the applicant was later quashed by ORG , which remitted the case for fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG the applicant reiterated his complaint that on DATE the pre - trial investigation judge had not allowed him to see the material submitted by the prosecutor . He also noted that PERSON had not informed the prosecutor about alleged undue influence on him until DATE after the alleged incident supposedly took place . In the view of the applicant , PERSON wished to incriminate him using any means possible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again acquitted the applicant , upholding its earlier finding that PERSON \u2019s testimony against the applicant was not consistent ( n\u0117ra nuosekl\u016bs ) . It also noted that the trial court had categorised the search for the applicant as unfounded ( nepagrista ) , without elaborating much on that issue . ORG emphasised that the applicant had never been in hiding from the authorities , even though the prosecutor had asked the appellate court to suppress that assessment , given by the trial court ( also see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "The applicant was released from the obligation not to leave his place of residence , and his travel documents were returned to him .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on the basis of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG adopted a separate ruling , noting that a search for a suspect could be ordered if the suspect \u2019s place of residence was unknown to the investigators , who , if that were the case , were obliged to take steps to find him or her . In the instant case , however , the applicant had never been in hiding from the investigators . On the contrary , he had lived in his apartment in GPE , had taken part in car rally competitions abroad , had won the President \u2019s cup after participating in the car rally \u201c Around GPE \u201d in DATE , and in DATE had even been elected president of the car rally committee . The applicant had also crossed the NORP State border both by car and as an airline passenger CARDINAL times , had worked at his private company and had paid social security contributions . All those events had taken place during the time when the search for the applicant , ordered on DATE , was being conducted . The applicant had at no time been called into the prosecutor \u2019s office and none of the applicant \u2019s family members had received any inquiries about the applicant \u2019s whereabouts from the police or had ever been visited by police officers . As confirmed by the police in DATE , no search file ( paie\u0161kos byla ) had ever been opened in respect of the applicant . Furthermore , in DATE he had been arrested ( sulaikytas ) in ORG town for having insulted police officers but was later released .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above , ORG concluded that the prosecutor had deliberately and unnecessarily ( nepagr\u012fstai ) ordered a search for the applicant without first having called him in for questioning or having taken any real measures to establish his whereabouts . The appellate court also found that the prosecutor had deliberately misled the courts in DATE by providing them with clearly untrue information at a time when those courts were making their decision as to whether or not to detain the applicant . This showed that the prosecutor had other goals in view , but it was not for ORG to determine what those other goals might have been . Nevertheless , as a consequence it was possible for the applicant to have been unlawfully detained for DATE from DATE until DATE . ORG therefore asked the Attorney ORG to determine whether the prosecutor \u2019s actions constituted abuse of office , which is a crime under NORP law . ORG also emphasised that \u2012 as was apparent from the court decision approving the applicant \u2019s detention , on CARDINAL DATE , and upholding his detention on remand by court rulings adopted DATE and DATE \u2012 in addition to ORG issued in DATE , \u201c the search for the applicant [ announced in DATE ] , had been CARDINAL of the main grounds for ordering his pre - trial detention and for prolonging it \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Attorney General concluded that the prosecutor had not committed any offence . On the contrary , it was the police officers who had not performed their duties properly by failing to locate the applicant ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) , as a result of which it had not been possible for the prosecutor to call the applicant in for questioning . In any case , to call in for questioning a person whose accomplices had been sentenced to DATE of imprisonment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was hardly a measure that would be considered justified in the interests of a successful pre - trial investigation . Once the police had informed the prosecutor of the applicant \u2019s possible whereabouts , the prosecutor immediately ordered the police officers to search those places and to arrest the applicant , who was charged DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The prosecutor \u2019s actions had therefore been based on factual circumstances and were lawful . There was no reason to conclude that he had misled the courts when they were deciding whether or not to detain the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In the view of the Deputy Attorney General , the fact that the prosecutor had referred to the search for the applicant and LAW in his requests to the court for the applicant \u2019s detention ( see paragraphs DATE above ) did not constitute significant grounds for keeping him detained . On the contrary , the courts noted the applicant \u2019s connections abroad , the fact that he owned property abroad , his wealth and the gravity of the crime of which he was suspected . The applicant and his lawyer had , moreover , actively exercised their defence rights in challenging the argument that the applicant had been hiding from investigators . It followed that the applicant \u2019s right to liberty had been restricted on a lawful basis .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the Deputy Attorney General established that the actions of a certain police investigator when executing the search for the applicant had been erratic . However , even though his actions could be deemed to constitute a disciplinary offence , the investigator no longer worked in the police force and could not therefore be punished .", "The Deputy Attorney General therefore refused to open a pre - trial investigation on the basis of the facts mentioned in the ORG of Appeal ruling of CARDINAL DATE . The decision was sent for inclusion in the applicant \u2019s criminal case file .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG again remitted the applicant \u2019s criminal case to the appellate instance for a fresh examination of evidence . The cassation court noted that PERSON \u2019s testimony did not automatically become less credible merely because he had cooperated with the authorities when telling them of ORG \u2019s assassination , and for that reason the prosecutor requested mitigation of ORG sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of having put out the contract for ORG \u2019s murder so that the applicant and others would not have to repay to ORG debts amounting to CARDINAL and MONEY ( USD ) . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 deprivation of liberty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG re - interpreted the domestic criminal law and upheld the trial court \u2019s verdict , sentencing the applicant to eight years\u2019 deprivation of liberty .", "According to the latest information from the applicant \u2019s lawyer , in DATE the applicant was released from prison before time ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
