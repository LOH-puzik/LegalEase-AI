In DATE the case of A ( GPE ) v. the Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL came before ORG . The appellant , an NORP national resident in GPE , was refused leave to join her husband , a refugee , in GPE because the marriage had taken place after he left his country of permanent residence . At the time of the application the appellant was heavily pregnant and there was evidence to suggest that her husband could not live in GPE . An Immigration Judge dismissed her appeal , which then went before ORG for reconsideration . The ORG was unable to identify any public interest being served by the omission from ORG of any provision for a refugee to bring a post - flight spouse to the country . However , it held that DATE could not be used to plug lacunae in LAW and , on the facts of the case , it was not engaged .", "CARDINAL . NORP On appeal , ORG had no doubt that the interference with family life which would result from not allowing a husband and his heavily pregnant wife in a genuine and subsisting marriage to cohabit had consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article CARDINAL . It therefore fell to ORG to consider whether or not there was a public interest in refusing to grant the appellant leave to enter . As the Government had submitted its skeleton argument on the public interest point at a late stage , the court held that it was estopped from reopening the issue . Although it went on to allow the appellant \u2019s appeal against the refusal of entry clearance , it clearly stated that its decision could be of no authority if and when the issue arose again .", "CARDINAL . DATE ORG ) had to consider the same question in FH ( ORG - flight spouses ) GPE [ DATE ] FAC . The appellant was an NORP national resident in GPE who was refused leave to join her husband , also an NORP national , who had been granted refugee status in GPE . It was not suggested that there was any other country where the appellant and sponsor could live together as husband and wife . An Immigration Judge refused her appeal . ORG allowed her appeal . It noted that with regard to the admission of post - flight spouses , refugees in GPE were in a particularly disadvantageous position compared to students , persons working in GPE , businessmen , artists and ministers of religion and so on . In particular , the ORG stated that :", "\u201c ... the appellant \u2019s situation is by no means an unusual one , and it arises from provisions of the Rules for which there appears to be no justification . Unless there is some justification , of which we have not been made aware , of the Rules\u2019 treatment of post - flight spouses , we think that the Secretary of ORG ought to give urgent attention to amending the Rules , by extending either paragraph CARDINAL or , ( perhaps preferably ) paragraph CARDINAL , so as to extend to the spouses of those with limited leave to remain as refugees . In the meantime , it seems to us that although a decision based on DATE does have to be an individual one in each case , it is most unlikely that the Secretary of ORG or an Entry Clearance Officer will be able to establish that it is proportionate to exclude from GPE the post - flight spouse of a refugee where the applicant meets all the requirements of paragraph CARDINAL save that relating to settlement . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of ORG provided that :", "\u201c The leave of a person whose stay in GPE is subject to a time limit lapses on his going to a country or territory outside the common travel area if the leave was given for DATE or less or conferred by a visit visa . In other cases , leave lapses on the holder remaining outside GPE for a continuous period of DATE . A person whose leave has lapsed and who returns after a temporary absence abroad within DATE leave has no claim to admission as a returning resident . His application to re - enter GPE should be considered in the light of all the relevant circumstances . The same time limit and any conditions attached will normally be reimposed if he meets the requirements of these Rules , unless he is seeking admission in a different capacity from the one in which he was last given leave to enter or remain . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
