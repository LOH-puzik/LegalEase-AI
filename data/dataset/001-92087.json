According to them , in DATE Government officials started to exercise pressure on the first applicant to induce him to give up the property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was arrested in PERSON together with his driver . At the police station , he was informed that he and his driver were being accused of carrying out a series of car thefts over DATE in PERSON . It would appear that several criminal complaints concerning car thefts were joined in a single procedure , while others were joined later ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a detention warrant in the first applicant \u2019s name for DATE . The grounds for detention were that he was suspected of committing a serious offence punishable by DATE imprisonment , that the criminal case was complex , and that he might abscond , hinder the investigation and the finding of the truth . An appeal by the applicant was dismissed and his detention was subsequently extended on the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON from the same court ordered the applicant \u2019s release . The grounds for release were that there were no reasons to believe that the applicant would abscond or hinder in any way the investigation . However , the prosecuting authorities refused to comply with the order and continued to hold the applicant in detention . They applied a second time for an extension of the detention but Judge PERSON refused again on DATE and found that the prosecutor had failed to comply with his previous decision and that therefore the applicant \u2019s detention had been unlawful . The prosecutor refused again to comply with the order of release and ordered his further detention on account of charges of theft from a ORG car , an episode which had not been joined to the main criminal case at that time . On DATE the prosecutor applied to another court , ORG , for a detention warrant . The charges against the first applicant were the same as before and no new reasons for detention were adduced .

During the first applicant \u2019s detention he was held in the detention facility of FAC ( Comisariatul General de Poli\u0163ie ) . According to him , the cells in which he was detained were overcrowded , dark , damp , dirty and hot . There was no natural light , but instead there was a very weak light bulb which was switched on all the time . The ventilation was not working properly and the inmates were allowed to smoke in the cell . The cell was infested with vermin and rats and the inmates were allowed to take showers only once DATE with cold water . The cells measured CARDINAL or QUANTITY and were occupied by CARDINAL people at all times . Because of the conditions of his detention the applicant contracted influenza .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG organised action in support of the first applicant on its web page , stating , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c ORG is concerned that PERSON is being charged on the basis of evidence which has been extracted under torture .

The organization is also concerned that PERSON is being detained arbitrarily .", "On DATE the central district court of PERSON ordered the release of PERSON on bail , but police officers immediately re - detained him in the court room and took him back to the temporary detention facility despite the court decision . On DATE , after his lawyer appealed against this arbitrary detention , the court declared that his detention was illegal . However , police officers again defied the court order and detained him in the court room . On CARDINAL DATE PERSON was sentenced to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment by the court of LOC in PERSON . DATE period was due to expire on DATE , but the investigating authorities have declared that the investigation is closed and that the case has now been transferred to the court . This effectively prolongs PERSON detention until the court hearing has been held .", "Furthermore , ORG is concerned about the conditions in which PERSON is being held at the temporary detention facility on FAC . He is currently being held in a cell with CARDINAL other detainees . The only washing facility is a tap and a basin in the cell , and conditions are damp and badly ventilated .

On an unspecified date in DATE the President of GPE , PERSON , held a meeting with high ranking officials , among whom was the Prosecutor General , the head of ORG , the head of ORG and the prefect of the county where the applicants\u2019 land was situated . During the meeting he expressed great dissatisfaction with the fact that in spite of his clear indications to numerous ORG bodies , the applicants\u2019 property was still in their possession and had not been returned to the ORG and a monastery . He gave them a deadline of CARDINAL DATE to solve the problem , threatened them with dismissal and left the room , slamming the door .", "CARDINAL .

According to the applicants , after the first applicant \u2019s arrest their family started to experience harassment from law enforcement bodies such as ORG , the police and ORG , who intimidated and pressured them to give up their property . While in detention the first applicant was approached by police officers , who proposed that he sell the property in exchange for his release . The second applicant was visited on numerous occasions by people claiming to be representatives of the above bodies . They requested her family to leave the property , failing which she would not see her husband again . The third applicant was contacted on numerous occasions by police officers and investigators in charge of her father \u2019s case and ordered to sell the property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant lodged a complaint with ORG complaining about the actions of CARDINAL police officers who had entered her property without any legal basis and ordered her , also in the absence of any legal basis , to take down a billboard at the entrance to the property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant received a letter from ORG , in which she was informed that the matters described by her had proved to be partially true ; however , there were no sufficient reasons to justify the prosecutor office \u2019s intervention .", "CARDINAL .

On an unspecified date the President of ORG and the President of ORG , PERSON , inquired with the Vice President of ORG , Judge PERSON , about the above case .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE Judge PERSON wrote to PERSON stating , inter alia , that the case was scheduled to be examined on DATE and that she would be dealing with it . It appears that the hearing of CARDINAL DATE was adjourned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the fourth applicant was sent a registered letter informing it that the hearing in the case was scheduled for DATE . It appears that the fourth applicant was no longer at the address to which the summons was sent and therefore did not receive the summons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON examined the case in the absence of the fourth applicant and upheld ORG action relying on LAW , in force at the time of the conclusion of the lease contract . It found that ORG had contravened the law by failing to organise a public auction for the lease of the property .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the fourth applicant appealed against the above judgment and argued , inter alia , that it had not been summoned and that it did not even know about the prosecutor \u2019s application before DATE . According to the law in force at the time of the conclusion of the lease , there was no obligation to hold an auction . That obligation referred only to sale of land by local authorities , but not to leases . In any event , the action was time - barred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a panel of ORG presided over by Judge PERSON dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and argued , inter alia , that it had been summoned at the address which appeared in the database of ORG , and that therefore the applicant had been legally summoned . The court also found that the local council had been under an obligation to organise an auction before renting out the land in question . ORG did not refer to the applicants\u2019 objection concerning LAW .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the fourth applicant lodged an action with ORG claiming compensation for the investments it had made in respect of the leased property .

The fourth applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor General brought an action with ORG of GPE seeking the annulment of the purchase of the plot of land of QUANTITY by the fourth applicant from ORG in DATE and of all the subsequent contracts by which the property had been transmitted to the first , second and third applicants . ORG argued that ORG had acted ultra vires and had committed numerous irregularities in organising the auction , establishing the price of the property and selling the property .", "CARDINAL . The applicants opposed all ORG submissions . Their main arguments were that ORG action was time - barred , that they had acquired the property in good faith and that the property could not be expropriated without compensation . At the same time the second and third applicants lodged a counter action in which they submitted that if ORG action was upheld they should be entitled to compensation for the investments they had made in the development of the property in an amount of MONEY ( ORG ) and LAW respectively .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG requested the applicants to pay court fees in the amount of PERCENT of the claimed amounts . The applicants appealed and argued that all their accounts had been seized by ORG , that they were unemployed and that they could not pay the court fees .

On DATE a panel of ORG presided by Judge PERSON dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the ORG counter action was dismissed on the ground of their failure to pay court fees . The applicants appealed against this decision . However , their appeal was dismissed on DATE by a panel of ORG presided over by Judge PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON from ORG upheld the action lodged by ORG , relying on LAW , in force at the time of the conclusion of the lease contract . Judge PERSON found that ORG had breached the rules concerning the conduct of public auctions , namely that it had failed to observe the rules concerning the advertising of the auction , the composition of the auction commission and the drafting of the auction record . The court did not refer to the applicant \u2019s objection concerning LAW and considered all the prosecutor \u2019s arguments well - founded . It ordered that the parties be put in the same position as they had been prior to the conclusion of the contract .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed and argued , inter alia , that they had been punished for errors of the local authorities which were not imputable to them , that the court was not independent and impartial , that the action was time - barred and that the actions against them had been orchestrated by President PERSON , submitting a copy of the video in which the President was shown instructing ORG officials to take away their property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal . It held that according to LAW claims filed in the ORG \u2019s interest were exempt from the requirement to observe time - limits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bailiff came to the applicants\u2019 property , accompanied by the mayor of GPE , in order to enforce CARDINAL of the civil judgments concerning the applicants\u2019 property . A quarrel took place between the first applicant and the mayor and DATE the latter lodged a complaint with ORG , complaining that the first applicant had made death threats against him . In particular , he submitted that during the quarrel the first applicant had said that he would feed him ( the mayor ) to the fishes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and placed in detention . On DATE ORG issued an order for him to be detained for DATE . That was extended on numerous occasions and the first applicant \u2019s appeals and habeas corpus requests rejected .", "CARDINAL . He was detained in the detention centre of ORG until DATE and then in PERSON no . CARDINAL prison . According to the applicant , the conditions of detention in both detention facilities amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention under the new charges continued until DATE , when he was placed under house arrest .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the first applicant initiated civil proceedings against the Government claiming compensation for poor conditions of detention in DATE and in DATE and for detention contrary to LAW . He relied , inter alia , on the ORG \u2019s findings in respect of conditions of detention in PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) , ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) , and PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) in which the applicants had been detained in the same detention facilities .", "DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action , upholding the ORG \u2019s position and finding that the conditions of detention on both occasions were acceptable . The court accepted several of the applicant \u2019s submissions , such as that his cell window did not have glass for DATE , that a person with scabies was placed in his cell on CARDINAL occasion , that there was no linen or mattresses in the cell , and that there was no sewerage in CARDINAL of the detention facilities . Nevertheless , it considered that these shortcomings were not sufficient for the application to be upheld , because the applicant did not have to share a bed with the ill prisoner , the latter had been receiving treatment for DATE and at the time of his placement in the cell he was no longer contagious . Moreover , the window cell was repaired after DATE and in any event the temperatures at DATE were usually moderate . In addition , prisoners were allowed to bring their own mattresses and linen . In so far as the complaint under LAW was concerned , the court found that there were no civil remedies against the alleged breaches under NORP law . This judgment was confirmed by ORG on DATE and by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged another action with ORG , again claiming compensation for his allegedly unlawful detention DATE . It appears that his action has not yet been determined .", "CARDINAL . The relevant findings of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG , unofficial translation ) read as follows :", "B. Establishments visited", "... - EDP of ORG ( Follow - up visit )", "... b. remand centres ( EDPs )", "CARDINAL . In its report on the DATE visit ( paragraph CARDINAL ) , the ORG was forced to conclude that material conditions of detention in the remand centres ( EDPs ) visited amounted in many respects to inhuman and degrading treatment and , in addition , constituted a significant risk to the health of persons detained . While recognising that it was not possible to transform the current situation in these establishments TIME , the ORG recommended a certain number of immediate palliative measures to guarantee basic conditions of detention that respect the fundamental requirements of life and human dignity .", "CARDINAL . NORP Unfortunately , during the DATE visit , the delegation found barely any traces of such palliative measures , in fact quite the opposite . ...", "CARDINAL . One can only regret that in their efforts to renovate these premises - which under the current economic circumstances deserve praise - the NORP authorities have paid no attention to the ORG recommendations . In fact , this state of affairs strongly suggests that , setting aside economic considerations , the issue of material conditions of detention in police establishments remains influenced by an outdated concept of deprivation of liberty .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the other EDPs visited across GPE , with very few exceptions the delegation observed the same types of disastrous and insalubrious material conditions . A detailed description is superfluous , since it has all been highlighted already in DATE of the report on the DATE visit .", "In PERSON , these conditions were exacerbated by serious overcrowding . At the time of the visit , there were CARDINAL prisoners for CARDINAL places , requiring QUANTITY persons to cram into a cell measuring QUANTITY into cells of CARDINAL m\u00b2 .", "CARDINAL . The delegation also received numerous complaints about the quantity of food in the EDPs visited . This normally comprised tea without sugar and a slice of bread in the morning , cereal porridge at lunch time and hot water in TIME . In some establishments , food was served just once a day and was confined to a piece of bread and soup . ...", "... Concerning the issue of access to toilets in due time , the ORG wishes to stress that it considers that the practice according to which detainees comply with the needs of nature by using receptacles in the presence of CARDINAL or several other persons , in a confined space such as the ORG cells which also serve as their living space , is in itself degrading , not only for the individual concerned but also for those forced to witness what is happening . Consequently , the ORG recommends that clear instructions be given to surveillance staff that detainees placed in cells without toilets should DATE if they so request \u2013 be taken out of their cell without delay during DATE in order to go to the toilet .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also recommends that steps be taken to :", "- reduce the overcrowding in PERSON as rapidly as possible and to comply with the official occupancy level ;", "- supply persons in custody with clean mattresses and clean blankets ;", "- authorise persons detained in all EDPs to receive packages from the outset of their custody and to have access to reading matter .", "In the light of certain observations made , particularly in the ORG of ORG , the ORG also reiterates its recommendation concerning strict compliance , in all circumstances , with the rules governing separation of adults and minors . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Conditions of detention .", "a. Institutions of ORG", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , when it first visited GPE , the ORG has serious concern for the conditions of detention in the institutions of ORG .", "The ORG notes that CARDINAL out of CARDINAL EDPs have been subjected to \u201c cosmetic \u201d repair and that CARDINAL have been equipped with places for DATE walks . Nevertheless , the DATE visit did not allow lifting the concern of ORG . In fact , most recommendations made have not been implemented .", "CARDINAL . Whether CARDINAL refers to the police stations or EDPs visited , the material conditions are invariably subject to the same criticism as in the past . Detention cells had no access to daylight or a very limited such access ; artificial light \u2013 with rare exceptions \u2013 was mediocre . Nowhere did the persons obliged to pass TIME in detention receive mattresses and blankets , even those detained for prolonged periods . Those who had such items could only have obtained them from their relatives ...", "CARDINAL . As for food ... in the EDPs the arrangements made were the same as those criticised in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report on that visit ) : generally CARDINAL modest distributions of food per day including tea and a slice of bread in the morning , a bowl of cereals at TIME and tea or warm water in TIME . Sometimes there was CARDINAL distribution of food per day . Fortunately , the rules for receiving parcels have been relaxed , which allowed detainees with relatives outside to slightly improve these meagre DATE portions .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the material conditions remain problematic in the police stations ; they remain disastrous in EDPs , continuing in many aspects to amount , for the detainees , to inhuman and degrading treatment . \u201d", "II . Institutions of ORG", "In so far as the conditions of detention in the police establishments are concerned , it appears that this is the field in which the least progress has been achieved . It is not necessary to enumerate here in detail all the shortcomings observed by the delegation , which are more or less the same as those observed during past visits ( and of which ORG is perfectly aware ) . ... Numerous persons are still detained overnight in police establishments , in cells which should not be used to detain persons for TIME . It is high time to remedy these problems , in particular by placing accused persons under the supervision of institutions of ORG and building new prisons corresponding to ORG standards and to the norms laid down by the NORP legislation . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
