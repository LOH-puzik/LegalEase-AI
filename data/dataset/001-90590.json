Identified by their names , they were said to be wanted by the police in connection with a murder .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to queries from the applicant \u2019s lawyers , ORG in GPE stated on DATE that , DATE , no criminal procedural measures of a coercive nature against the applicant had been registered in the relevant log . Further , by a notification of DATE , the NORP - Saburtalo police station confirmed to the lawyers that solely the applicant \u2019s brother , who was charged with the murder and firearms offences , had been declared wanted and that no similar measure had been taken with respect to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers requested ORG ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) to remove the applicant \u2019s photograph from the police stations and to punish those who had unlawfully posted it . In a reply of DATE , the ORG reiterated that only the applicant \u2019s brother had been wanted for the murder and firearms offences . As to the applicant , in view of his constant refusals to appear before the NORP - Saburtalo district prosecutor \u2019s office , the latter agency had taken \u201c the relevant operational measures aimed at having him interviewed , in the capacity of a witness \u201d . No reply was given to the request for the photograph \u2019s removal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers requested the ORG to initiate criminal proceedings for libel on the basis of the unlawful posting of the applicant \u2019s photograph in the police stations ( \u201c the libel complaint \u201d ) . Under LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) as in force at the material time , the offence of libel was a matter for private prosecution and , pursuant to LAW ORG , only a competent court was empowered to initiate criminal proceedings on the basis of a complaint by the victim .", "CARDINAL . As disclosed by the case file , the NORP - Saburtalo ORG decided to summon the applicant to a hearing , reasoning that it was necessary to hear oral submissions from him . The summons could not be served on the applicant at his home address , as his parents stated that his whereabouts had been unknown for DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the NORP - Saburtalo ORG dismissed the libel complaint . The court pointed out that a private prosecution could be requested either personally by the victim or by his representative in law ( LAW ORG ) . That being so , the court , whilst accepting the power of the applicant \u2019s lawyers to represent him , pointed out that the libel complaint had been signed not by the applicant or his representative in law but by the director of the human rights advocacy centre of which the lawyers were members . The lawyers replied that their client had been feeling insecure as to his liberty , hence his non - appearance before the court . They reiterated the content of the complaint orally , requesting the identification and punishment of those officials who had unlawfully posted the applicant \u2019s photograph and implicated him in the murder . ORG concluded that the disclosed no elements of libel . However , it decided to forward the request and the case file to the competent prosecutor \u2019s office so that the latter agency could examine whether any offence had been committed by public officials in the performance of their duties .", "CARDINAL . An appeal lay against the decision of CARDINAL DATE , but had to be lodged within the following DATE .

On DATE an article disclosing the story of the posted photograph was published in a national newspaper . Shortly afterwards , the applicant \u2019s photograph was removed from the police stations .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , the NORP - Saburtalo district prosecutor \u2019s office informed the applicant \u2019s lawyers that the court decision of DATE had never ordered it to initiate criminal proceedings either for libel or for any offence committed by persons holding public office , but had simply forwarded the case file with the instruction \u201c to react \u201d . Accordingly , the prosecutor \u2019s office had decided , on DATE , to forward the case to the ORG for an internal investigation . The letter of DATE did not enclose a copy of the decision of CARDINAL DATE and did not advise the applicant of the appeal procedure , if appropriate . As disclosed by the case file , the ORG never informed the applicant of any decision taken in respect of the subsequent developments in his case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lodged with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) another application to initiate criminal proceedings in respect of the unlawful posting of his photographs ( \u201c the second criminal complaint \u201d ) . The ORG transmitted this request to the GPE city prosecutor \u2019s office with the instruction to take \u201c a decision in accordance with the law \u201d . The latter agency forwarded this instruction to the ORG district prosecutor \u2019s office . According to the applicant , on CARDINAL DATE he requested a report from the prosecution authority on the progress of the proceedings in respect of his second criminal complaint but no reply was forthcoming . According to the Government , however , the ORG district prosecutor \u2019s office examined that complaint and took a decision on an unspecified date . Neither the content nor the date of that decision was specified by the Government in their observations .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , in the course of the investigation into the murder case , the authorities constantly threatened his parents that they would \u201c catch \u201d him , unless his fugitive brother surrendered to the authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant responded to the authorities\u2019 repeated calls to testify as a witness in the murder case by voluntarily appearing before the ORG district prosecutor \u2019s office . Upon arrival and without being examined in the capacity of a witness , he was arrested on suspicion of unlawfully acquiring , storing and/or transporting firearms and ammunition , which offence formed part of the murder case . The suspicion was formally based on several pieces of evidence \u2013 statements by CARDINAL witnesses , the results of a search and the forensic examination of the seized firearms \u2013 all of which had been obtained in DATE and DATE , in the course of the investigation into the murder case .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the NORP - Saburtalo district prosecutor \u2019s office disjoined the firearms aspect from the murder case and registered it as a separate set of proceedings ( \u201c the firearms case \u201d ) . Subsequently , the applicant was confronted , in the presence of his lawyer , with one of the witnesses whose statements had been obtained in DATE and DATE ( see the preceding paragraph ) . During that confrontation , the witness altered his previous testimony in favour of the applicant , by concluding that only the applicant \u2019s brother had been involved in the firearms offence . The investigator concluded that the applicant and his lawyer had subjected the witness to undue \u201c moral pressure \u201d during the confrontation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator reexamined the abovementioned witness , this time in the absence of the applicant and his lawyer . The witness retracted the altered testimony he had given the previous day and confirmed the truthfulness of the statements he had made in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the charge of storing and transporting firearms and ammunition was preferred against the applicant . This charge was based on the above - mentioned evidence obtained in the course of the investigation into the murder case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant pleaded \u201c not guilty \u201d . On DATE the prosecutor requested that the applicant be remanded in custody for DATE .", "CARDINAL . As disclosed by the case file , the prosecutor \u2019s main argument during the remand hearing was that the applicant \u2019s release could jeopardise the pending investigation of the murder case , particularly when CARDINAL of the accused in that case , his brother , was missing . The applicant replied that it was unlawful to justify his pre - trial detention in the interests of the murder case , as he had been detained solely on suspicion of having committed the firearms offence . He challenged the reasonableness of the latter suspicion as well . In favour of his release , the applicant submitted that he had not committed a single act capable of impeding the investigation for DATE and that he had voluntarily appeared before the prosecutor \u2019s office for an interview . He also referred to the fact that his father was seriously ill and required his care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s remand in custody for DATE , with effect from DATE . The detention order was a standard form , the reasoning of which had mostly been pre - printed . The judge added by hand the reference to the relevant evidence , the names of the parties\u2019 representatives to the proceedings and the classification of the impugned offence :", "\u201c Having examined [ in accordance with the requirements of procedural law ] the well - foundedness of the detention request , and having heard the parties\u2019 pleadings , I have come to the conclusion that the evidence collected \u2013 [ reference to the evidence obtained in DATE and DATE \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above ] \u2013 gives rise to a reasonable suspicion that PERSON has committed the impugned offence . The evidence has been obtained in conformity with the rules of criminal procedure .", "Procedural law was also observed in the course of PERSON arrest and in the bringing of charges against him .", "I consider that the detention request by [ reference to the prosecutor \u2019s name ] is substantiated and that there exist legal grounds for granting it . Thus , in so far as the accused , PERSON , is charged with a less serious crime , the danger that , if released , he might hamper the establishment of the truth or abscond from the investigation and trial is substantiated ... \u201d", "The judge then dismissed , in a handwritten note , the applicant \u2019s allegations of procedural violations as irrelevant to the classification of the impugned offence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a final decision of DATE the NORP ORG upheld the detention order of DATE , reasoning as follows :", "\u201c ... [ The applicant ] has been charged with an offence classified as less serious , which carries a maximum term of DATE imprisonment . The impugned offence of the unlawful acquisition , storage and/or transportation of firearms might be related to the murder case , the investigation of which is still pending . In such conditions , the discontinuation of detention on remand or its substitution with a non - custodial measure of restraint might possibly hamper the establishment of the truth in that case ; if released , the accused might influence witnesses , continue his criminal activities or abscond . Such conclusions can be derived from the insincerity of the accused .", "The case discloses both formal ( procedural ) and factual grounds for the imposition of pre - trial detention ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On several occasions in DATE and DATE , the applicant requested to be confronted again with the above - mentioned witness for the prosecution ( paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . His requests were dismissed as unsubstantiated , the authorities reasoning that the previous confrontation had been conducted in conformity with the procedural rules , whilst another one would most likely lead to the same result \u2013 the exertion of moral pressure on the witness in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the DATE pre - trial detention period expired , without a court ordering its extension . On DATE , having terminated the investigation , the prosecutor sent the criminal case for trial , forwarding the bill of indictment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge of the NORP - Saburtalo ORG , dispensing with an oral hearing , decided , in camera , to commit the applicant for trial under LAW ORG . This decision , like the detention order of DATE , was set out in a standard form with preprinted reasoning . The judge added , in the blank spaces provided , a brief statement of facts , the name of the accused and the definition of the impugned offence .", "CARDINAL . As to the reasoning , the decision of DATE confirmed the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention in a pre - printed phrase . The judge added by hand the definition of the measure of restraint :", "\u201c The measure of pre - trial restraint \u2013 detention DATE has been correctly chosen . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The application of a measure of restraint shall be justified if the evidence collected in the case file sufficiently substantiates the assumption that it is necessary to secure the aims mentioned in the first paragraph of this Article .", "CARDINAL .
