A short conversation took place between the CARDINAL ORG officers and a person holding a torch dressed in full military combat uniform . The officers noticed a second person also dressed in military uniform lying in a ditch apparently giving cover with a rifle . The scene at the checkpoint roused suspicions , inter alia , due to the lack of other vehicles , the accent of the person who stopped them and the length of hair of the man in the ditch . After being allowed through the checkpoint , the officers requested clarification by radio as to the presence of any army checkpoints in the vicinity . They were informed that none were operating . The police patrol drove to a police station , where , requesting army support , they decided to investigate further .", "CARDINAL .
