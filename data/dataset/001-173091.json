The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He works as a criminal defence lawyer .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant defended a client in criminal proceedings . After the proceedings had concluded , and when the client had already been imprisoned , the client \u2019s fianc\u00e9e transferred the applicant \u2019s legal fees ( CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) from her private bank account to the applicant \u2019s professional account . The subject of the bank transfer read : \u201c Prof PERSON fees ( client \u2019s last name ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the GPE public prosecution office conducted investigations into several individuals suspected of having committed fraud on a commercial basis as members of a gang . CARDINAL of the suspects was the aforementioned applicant \u2019s former client , who again retained the applicant as his defence lawyer . During these investigations , the bank accounts of several people , including the applicant \u2019s client and the client \u2019s fianc\u00e9e , were inspected . The inspection revealed that the client \u2019s fianc\u00e9e had received money ( ORG CARDINAL ) which was suspected to have stemmed from illegal activities , and had transferred ORG CARDINAL for legal fees to the applicant \u2019s bank account .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the bank transfer of fees from the fianc\u00e9e to the applicant in relation to the first set of criminal proceedings , the GPE public prosecution office also contacted the applicant \u2019s bank . On DATE the public prosecutor asked for a list of all transactions concerning the applicant \u2019s bank account from DATE until DATE . He asked the bank not to reveal the request to the applicant . He based his request for information on Articles CARDINALa , DATE and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , in conjunction with LAW ( see paragraphs ORG below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor requested further information and asked the following questions :", "\u201c ( a ) Which other bank accounts , investment accounts or safe deposit boxes at your bank belong to the person in question ?", "( b ) What rights of disposal ( Verf\u00fcgungsberechtigungen ) does the person in question have ?", "( c ) Who else has a right of disposal ?", "( d ) Do other accounts exist of which the person in question is the beneficiary ?", "( e ) If so , what are the current balances on these accounts ?", "( f ) If bank accounts have been closed by the person in question , please submit information about the date of closure and the balance at the time of closure , and where the money was transferred after closure .", "( g ) Which addresses of the person in question are known to you ?", "( h ) Are you aware of any money transfers to or other transactions with foreign countries ? If so , please specify the bank , account and amount of each transfer or transaction .", "( i ) Please submit a list of all transactions for all existing or closed accounts from CARDINAL DATE .", "( j ) Are there any credit cards connected to any of the accounts ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . The bank complied with both requests for information and submitted the information to the public prosecution office . In both instances , the public prosecutor did not order the bank to submit the information , but pointed to the obligations of witnesses set out in the ORG and the possible consequences of noncompliance ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The information received was analysed by the police and the public prosecutor , and a list of CARDINAL transactions deemed to be relevant was included in the investigation file as evidence . Therefore , everyone who had access to the case file , such as the lawyers of the coaccused , also had access to the applicant \u2019s banking information , including the names of his clients who had transferred fees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after several unsuccessful requests , the applicant , as the lawyer of the accused , was granted access to the investigation file . From the case file he learned , for the first time , of the investigative measures concerning his own bank account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to hand over to him all data received from the bank and destroy all related data at the public prosecution office . In his request the applicant emphasised his role as a criminal defence lawyer , which was known to the acting public prosecutor , and the consequences for his clients , whose names were accessible through the banking information . He further argued that the investigative measures lacked a legal basis .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the GPE Chief Public Prosecutor refused the applicant \u2019s request . He stated that there was a suspicion that the money transferred from the client \u2019s fianc\u00e9e stemmed from illegal activities . Consequently , it was legitimate for the public prosecutor to investigate whether further money transfers had taken place between the applicant and his client or the client \u2019s fianc\u00e9e . Therefore , since the investigative measures were legitimate , the information received had to be kept in the investigation file . ORG further pointed out that there was no legal basis for returning the data or taking the documents out of the investigation file . ORG cited LAW of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as a legal basis for the information requests , since the bank in question was a bank under public law and therefore considered to be an authority .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the file was transferred to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , because the criminal proceedings against the applicant \u2019s client had started . The applicant therefore asked ORG to return the data .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s application . The court found that the investigation was lawful , that the bank had provided the information voluntarily , that the documents could therefore only be returned to the bank and not to the applicant , and that the prohibition of seizure under LAW ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was not applicable , since the information had not been in the applicant \u2019s possession . Nonetheless , in order to safeguard the clientlawyer privilege , it also decided to separate the documents in question from the general court file and only grant access to them if reasons proving sufficient interest were provided .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision . He challenged in particular the findings that the bank had acted voluntarily and that there had been sufficient suspicion for such an extensive analysis of his banking transactions . He further reiterated that , owing to his position as a lawyer , there were several safeguards in place concerning the seizure of documents ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , and these should not have been circumvented because his and his clients\u2019 personal information was stored at and by the bank , and not at his office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG confirmed the decision of ORG . It found that the decision was proportionate and that the safeguards were not applicable , in particular since the bank could not be considered a person assisting the applicant or a person involved in the professional activities of the applicant under Article CARDINAL of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , without providing reasons ( case no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
