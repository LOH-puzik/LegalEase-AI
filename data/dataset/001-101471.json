The first applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP and NORP citizen , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . The second and third applicants are his children , PERSON , born in DATE , and PERSON , born in DATE . They currently live in GPE with PERSON , their mother .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant and PERSON got married in DATE in GPE . The CARDINAL had already lived together as a couple in GPE for DATE before the wedding . In DATE and DATE respectively , their CARDINAL children , PERSON and PERSON , were born in GPE . Their last place of residence in GPE was PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , as explained by the applicant , the couple , who had joint custody of the children , agreed that the mother and the CARDINAL children would visit the mother 's family in GPE for DATE . On DATE , the mother and the children left for GPE ; according to their roundtrip airline tickets , they were scheduled to be back on DATE .", "However , they never returned to GPE ; on DATE , PERSON 's mother informed the first applicant that PERSON and the children would remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the first applicant filed for the return of his children , under LAW ( proceedings described under no . CARDINAL below ) , while PERSON filed for divorce and custody of the children with the NORP courts ( proceedings described under no . CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant filed a request for the return of his children under LAW DATE on ORG ( \u201c LAW ) . The request was submitted through ORG to ORG ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) . The first applicant claimed that his wife was wrongfully retaining their children in GPE , without his consent .", "On DATE the Ministry , acting as ORG for the purpose of LAW , instituted proceedings on behalf of the first applicant before ORG of FAC .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the evidence adduced in the case , which included a \u201c psychological evaluation of the children \u201d , ORG found on DATE that the retention of the children in GPE was illegal under LAW , as at the time of the retention the father had lawful custody rights . It also held that the allegations of PERSON according to which the first applicant had agreed that the children should remain in GPE as his financial situation in GPE was precarious , confirmed by the witness M .- A. T. , who stated that neither the applicant , nor PERSON had a job in GPE , were however unsubstantiated , as the first applicant had proved that he had made attempts to rent a house for the family , had enrolled the children in a local kindergarten and was regularly in contact with the children by phone .", "The defence raised by ORG under LAW b ) of LAW was also dismissed by the court ; it considered that the \u201c state of insecurity \u201d invoked and the \u201c general threat of terrorist attacks \u201d arising in GPE had not proved to be an obstacle to the family living in GPE for DATE prior to the children 's removal , and could not be regarded as having developed to a dangerous degree at that time . The court ordered that the children be returned to their habitual residence in GPE DATE after the judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . A.R. filed an appeal against this decision , which was allowed by ORG in a final judgment of DATE . Out of the panel of CARDINAL judges , Judge PERSON gave a dissenting opinion , favouring the reasoning of the first - instance court .", "The majority 's decision was based on CARDINAL conclusions : firstly , that LAW was not applicable to the case , in so far as the children , NORP citizens , had left GPE and remained in GPE upon the agreement of the parents ; secondly , that in any event , the exception provided for by LAW b ) of the ORG was substantiated , as it had been proved that , if returned to GPE , the children would risk exposure to physical or psychological harm .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court thus found that the children had left GPE and remained in GPE with the consent of their father , due to the worsening of his financial situation . The agreement between the parents was for the children to stay in GPE until the first applicant 's financial situation improved \u2013in that respect , even the fact that they had bought roundtrip tickets , which were cheaper than CARDINAL - way tickets , only underlined the financial difficulties the family was undergoing ; however , as time passed , the evidence showed that this situation had kept worsening , since the first applicant had sold the house where they had lived as a family , after the departure of PERSON with the children , and gone to live with his mother . Also , the first applicant had not produced any evidence to support his claim that he had sent money to his children .", "The court further held that the first applicant had not proved that he had maintained contact with his children ; in the file there was only evidence of CARDINAL visit paid by the first applicant to his children , on DATE ; the phone calls allegedly made by the first applicant to his children in GPE had been made from the house of the first applicant 's mother , which was interpreted as meaning that the conversations had been between the children and their paternal grandmother .", "Hence , the agreement between the spouses regarding the children remaining in GPE proved to be real and such an agreement could by no means be regarded as breaching LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the evidence in the file showed that the CARDINAL children had integrated into the NORP community successfully \u2013 they had good results at kindergarten and positive psychological evaluations \u2013 arguments which supported a dismissal of the first applicant 's action . The court also held that \u201c the evaluation of the children carried out by ORG in the presence of a counsellor revealed that no assessment could be made of the possible effects of the separation of the father from his children , insofar as there was insufficient information with regard to the father - children relationship \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The defence under LAW b ) of LAW , namely , that there was a grave risk of exposing the children to intolerable physical harm if returned to GPE , was also allowed . The court based their reasoning , inter alia , on \u201c the reports produced by ORG \u201d , which stated according to the court , that PERSON was located in a conflict area , where citizens feared for their safety . At the same time , the court based its reasoning on travel advice issued in DATE by ORG , in which warnings were allegedly made about \u201c potential conflicts which could arise between the NORP and the NORP \u201d , and \u201c signs of possible terrorist attacks in the area \u201d were referred to .", "In a dissenting opinion to the judgment , Judge PERSON underlined that the above - mentioned documents \u201c did not actually refer specifically to PERSON , but to other regions of GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was never given a copy of the above - mentioned reports . In a certificate issued by ORG on DATE to the applicant it was mentioned that neither the ORG reports , nor the GPE ORG release were to be found in the domestic case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON filed for divorce , custody of the children and maintenance before ORG of FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant ( defendant ) , represented by an appointed lawyer , presented his observations in reply to PERSON 's claims . He contended that the NORP courts did not have general jurisdiction in such proceedings , in so far as the marriage was registered in GPE , the defendant was an NORP and NORP citizen , the couple 's children were NORP citizens , and the last marital home had been in GPE .", "He also lodged counterclaims asking the courts to either grant him full custody of the CARDINAL children , or to order their return to their habitual residence in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the court rejected the first applicant 's plea regarding the lack of jurisdiction , considering that \u201c the NORP courts did have full jurisdiction in such cases , pursuant to ORG ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL of DATE concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , the district court granted ORG a divorce on the grounds of exclusive fault by the first applicant .", "Based on the conclusions of a social enquiry report on the children 's concrete situation , which held that they were well taken care of and benefited from a good standard of living , and taking into consideration their ages ( CARDINAL and DATE , at that time ) , the court awarded custody of the children to the mother . The court found that it was in their best interest to remain with their mother , her care and presence being a psychological factor which was absolutely essential for their intellectual , moral and physical development .", "In the absence of any proof regarding the first applicant 's employment and/or income , the court referred to the national minimum wage scale and ordered him to pay DATE maintenance in the amount of CARDINAL PERSON in respect of each child , starting on DATE and until they reached the age of majority .", "Neither the first applicant , nor PERSON have lodged any appeals against this judgment , which thus became final and enforceable .", "CARDINAL .
