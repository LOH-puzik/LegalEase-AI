THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE - upon - GPE . She is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE - upon - GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant has been involved in peaceful protests designed to draw attention to practices carried out at ORG in GPE .", "On DATE a ORG interim injunction was obtained against the applicant ( and others ) under section CARDINAL of ORG ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) by the plaintiffs to a civil claim against her , the PERSON family , who lived at the farm . The injunction was granted without the applicant having notice of the application , in her absence and prior to the issue of civil proceedings .", "The Order restrained the applicant from pursuing a course of conduct which amounted to harassment of any of the plaintiffs including , in particular , communicating with them or coming onto their farm , the land immediately adjoining their farm or certain parts of a nearby public highway , whether for the purposes of protesting or otherwise . It provided :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) This Order prohibits you from doing the acts set out in this Order . You should read it carefully . You are advised to consult your solicitor as soon as possible . You have a right to ask the ORG to vary or discharge this Order .", "( CARDINAL ) If you disobey this Order you may be found guilty of ORG and you may be sent to prison or fined and if fined your assets may be seized . \u201d", "It continued further as follows :", "\u201c VARIATION OR DISCHARGE OF THIS ORDER", "The Defendant may apply to the ORG at any time to vary or discharge this Order but if he wishes to do so he must first inform ORG in writing TIME beforehand . \u201d", "Thereafter the applicant states that she , acting in person , served a timely defence and a notice of application to have the injunction varied or discharged on both ORG and the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors . She expected that the court would list the matter thereafter . No such listing and/or hearing had taken place prior to the applicant \u2019s arrest for the criminal offence of harassment in DATE . The applicant states that subsequent enquiries have revealed that ORG did not have a copy of the application to vary or discharge the injunction on its file and that it appears that the document was lost either in the post or at the ORG office .", "The magistrate in her criminal proceedings ( see below ) found as a fact that the applicant had served a timely defence on both the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors and on the court and had requested the removal of the injunction , but that she was still awaiting a reply and an opportunity to challenge the injunction at the time of her criminal trial .", "In DATE the applicant was arrested and charged ( along with CARDINAL others ) with a criminal offence under LAW . The information laid alleged as follows :", "\u201c PERSON , jointly with others DATE at ORG , ORG , GPE pursued a course of conduct which amounted to harassment of PERSON , contrary to section CARDINAL of the Protection from Harassment Act CARDINAL . \u201d", "The applicant was tried by a stipendiary magistrate . Evidence was heard for DATE between DATE and DATE . On DATE , the magistrate acquitted the applicant , holding that , while her course of conduct amounted to harassment and she knew or ought to have known that it did so , it was reasonable in the circumstances . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of the Act , it was a defence for the defendant to show that in the particular circumstances the pursuit of the course of conduct was reasonable . In considering whether to regard the applicant \u2019s behaviour as reasonable , the magistrate balanced the \u201c highly valued and protected \u201d right to protest against the effect of the protests on the occupants of the farm . He continued :", "\u201c ... there has been in the evidence no suggestion of violence and not more than the smallest hint of possible damage and abusive language .", "Even in the case of DATE I am far from certain about the value of the evidence . What I have heard and been impressed by is that all of them [ the Defendants ] , and PERSON in particular , have gone out of their way to avoid such behaviour and have indeed counselled others against it .", "What all this amounts to is that I am satisfied that the purpose of the protest and the way in which these CARDINAL pursued it was reasonable and I therefore dismiss all the charges against them . \u201d", "The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed by way of case stated to ORG . ORG was required to answer the following question :", "\u201c Whether as a matter of law the course of conduct pursued by the defendant PERSON could have been deemed to be reasonable having regard to the fact that the course of conduct was in breach of the terms of ORG injunction served on the defendant PERSON on DATE . \u201d", "ORG answered the above question in the negative ( R v. ORG , ex parte PERSON and others , DATE , case no . CO/CARDINAL/CARDINAL [ \u201c ex parte PERSON \u201d ] ) . It considered that on the basis that the conduct in question did amount to harassment and was in breach of the injunction , it was not open to the applicant on the facts as found to establish that she had a defence of reasonableness within section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of the LAW . Mr Justice PERSON stated that :", "\u201c ... The injunction , if granted , must be obeyed , and unless and until it is set aside , it binds the party in question . It can not be right for an individual to say to him or herself , that he or she will ignore the terms of the injunction because he or she believes that the conduct in question is reasonable .", "The course that must be adopted is to apply to set the injunction aside . The judge will then decide whether the conduct is reasonable , or should be prevented . He will carry out the balancing exercise . But , as it seems to me , it is incumbent upon a magistrate , faced with an injunction , to accept that it means that the defendant is unable to discharge the burden placed upon him by the LAW of establishing that the conduct was reasonable .", "For my part , I find it quite impossible to accept that it can be reasonable to pursue a course of conduct in breach of an injunction which is designed to stop such conduct . \u201d", "In a concurring judgment , Lord Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c It is , in my opinion , to be presumed that the injunction , although ex parte and interim , has been obtained properly , and it is to be obeyed until it expires , or is set aside or varied by ORG . A person who is aware that he or she is subject to an injunction , made by ORG , and who can apply to set it aside or to vary it , can not be conducting him or herself reasonably if he or she deliberately and without reasonable excuse breaks the terms of the injunction .", "Miss PERSON was in breach of the injunction in CARDINAL respects . She was upon the road outside the farm ... and she on occasions trespassed on the Harrisons\u2019 land .", "The particular circumstances , against which the reasonableness of that course of conduct had to be measured , included the existence of the High Court order . There was no justification put forward by Miss PERSON either before the stipendiary magistrate or before this Court , for her disobeying the order of ORG ...", "What is certain , in my judgment , is that conduct which flouts a ORG order can not be reasonable unless there exists a wholly exceptional excuse for doing so , such as the instance put forward by Mr. PERSON during argument , that it is necessary to go into a prohibited area to rescue someone who is in imminent danger . Any other view could lead to inconsistent conclusions being reached by the GPE court and ORG ; a most undesirable result . \u201d", "While not necessary for the determination of the point in issue , during the course of his judgment , Mr ORG also referred to the additional defence that the applicant had run under section CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( that she had pursued her course of conduct for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime ) and observed that :", "\u201c ... I find it difficult to see how a protest of this sort , carried on over a lengthy period of time , could be said to have been pursued for the purpose of detecting or preventing crime . It is no crime to run a mink farm and as the magistrate found , there was never any evidence of breaches of any regulations covering the manner in which the minks had to be kept . \u201d", "ORG directed the GPE court to proceed in the light of its judgment .", "The applicant thereafter applied to ORG for leave to present a petition of appeal to ORG and for certification of the following point of law as CARDINAL of general public importance :", "\u201c Whether conduct which is in breach of an injunction imposed in civil proceedings is capable of being reasonable under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of ORG . \u201d", "On DATE , the ORG certified the point of law as being CARDINAL of general public importance . However , it refused the applicant \u2019s application for leave to present a petition of appeal to ORG .", "On DATE , the applicant was granted legal aid to pursue a petition of appeal to ORG . However , she was advised by both leading and junior counsel in conference on DATE , and in a subsequent written opinion by junior counsel on DATE , that her appeal had little prospect of success . Indeed , in that written opinion counsel stated that she was \u201c quite certain that ORG would not grant leave \u201d . The applicant was then informed by her solicitors that her legal aid would be discharged , which occurred subsequently . The applicant thereafter instructed a new firm of solicitors on a pro bono basis to seek a further opinion from counsel regarding a potential appeal to ORG . A further experienced barrister advised by telephone on DATE that a petition to ORG would be unlikely to be successful . She had , in fact , also previously received advice to the same effect on DATE from the barrister who represented her in ORG . This avenue of appeal was therefore not pursued .", "On DATE , as a result of the judgment of ORG , the applicant was convicted by the stipendiary magistrate . She was sentenced to an absolute discharge and an indefinite restraining order under LAW , which read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL ) The Defendant is prohibited from assaulting , molesting , harassing , threatening , pestering or otherwise interfering with Mr. PERSON , his children or members of his family , Mrs. PERSON , Mrs. PERSON and PERSON , by doing acts to cause them , their servants , agents , employees or customers harm whether directly or indirectly .", "CARDINAL ) The Defendant is prohibited from making any communication to Mr. PERSON , his family , servants , agents , employees or customers whether in writing or orally , whether by telephone or otherwise .", "CARDINAL ) The Defendant is prohibited from entering upon the land of PERSON at ORG , ORG , GPE , or travelling within QUANTITY thereof . \u201d", "On DATE , the applicant applied to ORG for leave to appeal , out of time , against the magistrate \u2019s decision to convict and sentence her . This application was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant , acting in person , applied to ORG for permission to seek judicial review of ORG decision . Permission was granted on DATE . At the full hearing on DATE , ORG decision was quashed ( R v. ORG , ex parte PERSON , DATE , case no . CO/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Permission to appeal out of time was granted in relation to the applicant \u2019s submissions concerning the defence which she had raised under section CARDINAL ) of the Act at the GPE court trial , namely that she pursued her course of conduct for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime . She argued that it was her co - defendants who were primarily running the defence of reasonable conduct under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) and that the magistrate effectively \u201c rolled up \u201d the defences that were being put forward under subsection ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , without specifically differentiating between the evidence which was being put forward on behalf of her co - defendants and her own evidence .", "ORG held that although ORG in ex parte PERSON had ruled that her reasonableness defence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of the LAW had been determined against her by the existence of the injunction , it was still open to the applicant to argue before ORG that her actions were lawful under section CARDINAL ) of the LAW . Lord Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c ... the judge was wrong to conclude that ORG decision in any way precluded the applicant either as a matter of law from seeking to pursue her defence under section CARDINAL ) , or in any way , insofar as he sought to do so , concluding that on the merits there was no basis upon which it could properly be said that there was material which could found such a defence . The applicant had put before him arguments which indicated that she had been seeking to obtain evidence or other material which would affect the regulatory or prosecuting authorities based upon her assertion that criminal activity was taking place at the mink farm . She may or may not , at DATE , on the facts be able to establish her case , because the burden of proof will be on her ; and , in particular , she will have the difficulty , if she is to succeed , of having to establish that the purpose of her activities was for preventing or detecting crime ... Those will be issues which are properly issues to be determined on the basis of proper conclusions on the facts after the hearing of evidence . It seems to me that nothing that was decided by ORG can impinge upon the applicant \u2019s right to have those issues properly so resolved . \u201d ( [ DATE ] ORG ADMIN CARDINAL at paragraph CARDINAL )", "Thereafter , the appeal in ORG was listed for DATE . However , by letter of DATE the applicant informed ORG that she wished to abandon the appeal for medical reasons .", "Section CARDINAL of the LAW creates a general prohibition on harassment as defined in that section , subject to certain exceptions , stating in its material part :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A person must not pursue a course of conduct \u2013", "( a ) which amounts to harassment of another , and", "( b ) which he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other . ...", "( CARDINAL ) Subsection ( CARDINAL ) does not apply to a course of conduct if the person who pursued it shows \u2013", "( a ) that it was pursued for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime , [ or ] ...", "( c ) that in the particular circumstances the pursuit of the course of conduct was reasonable . \u201d", "Non - compliance with LAW can give rise to criminal ( section CARDINAL ) and civil ( section CARDINAL ) liability .", "Section CARDINAL of the LAW states in its material part :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A person who pursues a course of conduct in breach of LAW is guilty of an offence . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the LAW states in its material part :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) An actual or apprehended breach of LAW may be the subject of a claim in civil proceedings by the person who is or may be the victim of the course of conduct in question . \u201d", "The availability of a civil remedy enables injunctions to be granted during the course of civil proceedings . A civil cause of action must exist before an injunction can be granted .", "The breach of any injunction can give rise to civil committal proceedings . At any such proceedings the court has the power to commit a person who is found to be in breach of the injunction to prison .", "Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) to CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act make provision for the procedures that can be taken and the sanctions which can be imposed if a civil injunction is breached . Its provisions , while drafted at the time of the commencement of the LAW on DATE , only took effect as from DATE . These provisions were therefore not in force at the time that the applicant was charged under LAW . The provisions read , in relevant part :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where \u2013", "( a ) in [ civil ] proceedings ORG or a county court grants an injunction for the purpose of restraining the defendant from pursuing any conduct which amounts to harassment , and", "( b ) the plaintiff considers that the defendant has done anything which he is prohibited from doing by the injunction ,", "the plaintiff may apply for the issue of a warrant for the arrest of the defendant . ...", "( CARDINAL ) The judge or district judge to whom an application under subsection ( CARDINAL ) is made may only issue a warrant if -", "( a ) the application is substantiated on oath , and", "( b ) the judge or district judge has reasonable grounds for believing that the defendant has done anything which he is prohibited from doing by the injunction .", "( CARDINAL ) Where \u2013", "( a ) the High Court or a county court grants an injunction for the purpose mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL)(a ) , and", "( b ) without reasonable excuse the defendant does anything which he is prohibited from doing by the injunction ,", "he is guilty of an offence . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the LAW enables a court sentencing a person who commits a criminal offence under LAW to impose a restraining order upon that person .
