The first applicant , originally from GPE in central GPE , arrived in GPE on DATE and claimed asylum on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The basis of his asylum claim was his fear of both the ORG and PERSON - i - Islami ( \u201c HII \u201d ) due to his perceived connections with ORG and ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . He claimed that DATE after his birth he had moved to GPE with his family and that , in DATE , he and his family had emigrated to GPE owing to problems that they had had with the ORG primarily as a result of their NORP ethnicity . They had returned to GPE in DATE where they had lived until his departure from GPE . The first applicant claimed that DATE , he had worked as a driver distributing leaflets for the elections and that , in that capacity , he had regularly worked with ORG in GPE ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . DATE until DATE , he had worked as a driver in GPE for ORG , a branch of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . In DATE , DATE before he had left GPE , he had received a telephone call in the PERSON language from an unknown person ( who he had presumed to be a member of the ORG ) threatening his life and that of his family unless he stopped working with \u201c foreigners and non - NORP \u201d . He had spoken to his friends about the phone call but had initially decided to ignore it . DATE , he claimed that the ORG had come to his home , had made further threats against him and , in his absence , had kidnapped his cousin . The first applicant claimed that he had been advised on the phone by his family to leave GPE immediately for his own safety . He had therefore fled to GPE , where his family had joined him DATE . However , in GPE he had felt that he remained a ORG target and so he had arranged his journey through LOC to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG refused the first applicant \u2019s asylum application considering that he had fabricated aspects of his account and that his credibility was undermined by his failure to claim asylum in the NORP countries that he had passed through on his journey . Whilst it was acknowledged that the ORG had been responsible for attacks on NORP in the past , it was not accepted that the first applicant had ever been targeted by the ORG or that he would be at risk in the future . It was similarly accepted that there may well have been incidents of the targeting of those working for foreign or international organisations within GPE , but it was considered to be pure speculation that the threatening phone call that the first applicant had received in DATE had been from the ORG . Further , it was considered to be inconsistent that the first applicant would have been able to work for the ORG for DATE without any incidents occurring earlier . Even if the first applicant \u2019s cousin had been kidnapped , there was nothing to suggest that the incident related to the first applicant \u2019s involvement with the ORG or a systematic campaign against him . Even taking the first applicant \u2019s claim at its highest , it was noted that the first applicant had failed to seek assistance from the NORP authorities , the ORG or any other party in GPE . It was therefore considered that he had failed to demonstrate that a sufficiency of protection was not available to him in GPE or that he could not internally relocate to another area of GPE for safety .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed against the refusal of his asylum claim and , in a determination published on DATE , the then ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) dismissed his appeal . The immigration judge accepted that the first applicant was of NORP ethnicity and that it was probably true that he had been employed by the ORG as a driver from DATE until DATE . The immigration judge also accepted that the first applicant had probably received a veiled threat in a telephone call from the ORG , which he had decided initially to ignore . He considered that such action demonstrated that the first applicant had had no fear of the ORG at that time . The immigration judge did not believe that there was any truth in the suggestion that the first applicant had been targeted by the ORG who had kidnapped his cousin instead of him . The fact that the first applicant had been able to go home and travel to GPE before fleeing to LOC was found to indicate that he had not been under any specific threat from the ORG . Further , the immigration judge did not believe that the first applicant would be known throughout GPE as a ORG driver . Finally , even if the whole of the first applicant \u2019s account was true , the immigration judge considered that there was no reason why he could not safely relocate within GPE , particularly to GPE to where he would be removed in any event . In sum , the immigration judge did not accept that there were substantial grounds for believing that the first applicant would face a real risk of suffering serious harm if he were returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant applied for reconsideration arguing that he would be at risk because of the level of violence in GPE . On DATE , a Senior Immigration Judge refused his application for reconsideration noting that the first applicant had not sought to challenge any of the immigration judge \u2019s findings in his case but had instead sought to rely on LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused a further application for reconsideration , noting the findings of the Country Guidance determination of ORG ( Article PERSON ) : indiscriminate violence ) GPE CG [ DATE ] UKAIT CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and concluding that it would not be unduly harsh or unreasonable to expect a young man , like the first applicant , to return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant left GPE on DATE and arrived in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . He claimed asylum on DATE on the basis of his fear of the ORG due to his work as an interpreter for GPE armed forces and ORG ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) from DATE until DATE . He submitted letters in support from various commanding officers in the GPE forces which confirmed that he had worked with GPE forces in GPE province in north - eastern GPE . He claimed that he had received threats from the ORG including a threat to behead him if he continued to work with foreigners . He also claimed that , in DATE , he had been the interpreter involved in the search and rescue operation of an aid worker , which had ultimately led to the aid worker \u2019s death and the death of CARDINAL ORG members . He claimed that he had located the aid worker using a scanner and that the ORG were aware of the significance of his role in that operation which had heightened their adverse interest in him . The second applicant had eventually fled GPE after seeing armed ORG outside his house . The second applicant additionally claimed that he would not be able to relocate to GPE for safety because he had relatives who lived there who were involved in the ORG and who would seek to forcibly recruit him into their forces .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG refused his asylum application . It was accepted that he had worked as an interpreter for GPE forces in GPE . However , it was not accepted that the second applicant had been involved in the search for the aid worker given that the information that he had given regarding the same contradicted the information which was available in the public domain . Additionally , it was not accepted that the second applicant had received threats as he had claimed from the ORG given , inter alia , the discrepancies in his account over the dates of the same ; and the fact that it was not plausible that the ORG would have continued to threaten him rather than harm him , even after he had continued to work as an interpreter despite their earlier warnings . It was also considered that the fact that he had continued to work for GPE forces , despite the threats against him , was at odds with his claimed fear of the ORG . Furthermore , it was not accepted that ORG members had attended his home to kill him in DATE given that they had not fired at him and that he had been able to escape . The second applicant \u2019s credibility was also considered to be undermined by the fact that he had failed to claim asylum in GPE , despite having spent DATE there on his way to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In sum , even taking the second applicant \u2019s claims at its highest , it was not accepted by the Secretary of ORG that his fear of the ORG was well - founded because it was not accepted that he had had any real difficulties with them in the past . Furthermore , it was considered that he had failed to establish a sustained and systemic failure of state protection on the part of the NORP authorities and he could therefore seek protection from the NORP authorities against the ORG . Finally , it was considered that he could internally relocate to GPE for safety if necessary as a fit and healthy man of DATE . In that regard , it had not been accepted that he was at any risk of being forcibly recruited by HII given that he was uncertain whether or not his relatives were even still alive and because such a fear was entirely speculative .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed against the refusal of his asylum claim and , in a decision of DATE , the First - tier ORG ) ( \u201c the First - tier ORG \u201d ) dismissed his appeal . The immigration judge accepted that the second applicant had worked as an interpreter for GPE forces in GPE province , had probably used a scanner and had been given a weapon for his own protection given that he had been working in a volatile area .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the immigration judge did not accept that the second applicant had been involved in the rescue operation of the aid worker and found that he had fabricated that part of his claim and spoken of a well known and well publicised incident to embellish a claim that he would be at enhanced risk upon return to GPE . In that regard , the immigration judge considered , inter alia , that the second applicant would have known the aid worker \u2019s surname had he been so involved in the search operation ; that there were inconsistencies between his account and the account set out in newspaper articles ; and that the dates that he had given were inaccurate and inconsistent with when the rescue of the aid worker had taken place . Furthermore , the immigration judge considered that , if the second applicant had had such a pivotal role in the operation , the GPE forces would have provided a more recent and specific letter of recommendation rather than the general and comparatively out of date letters that he had submitted at his appeal . Furthermore , the immigration judge did not accept that the second applicant would have been the only interpreter involved in such a rescue operation , given the sensitivity of the same , the number of personnel involved and the number of villages that had been searched . The immigration judge also found that the second applicant had not given a credible explanation as to how the ORG would have been aware that he had been the interpreter who had identified the location of the aid worker and that he had been inconsistent about when he had allegedly received threats from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The immigration judge further entirely disbelieved that there would be any risk to the second applicant in GPE from members of his family who would force him to join DATE and considered that that issue had been an embellishment of his claim . In that regard , the immigration judge noted that the second applicant had not submitted any evidence regarding the same and that in his asylum interview he had stated that those relatives were missing and may even have died .", "CARDINAL . The immigration judge commented that during the course of the hearing he had found the second applicant to be an untruthful witness who had been anxious to give a rehearsed story .", "CARDINAL . Additionally , the immigration judge considered the second applicant \u2019s claim with reference to the country guidance determination of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and stated that he had considered with care whether the second applicant would fall within an enhanced risk category because of his work as an interpreter for the GPE forces but had concluded that that could not be considered to be the case given that many NORP nationals would have worked for the GPE and international forces . The immigration judge further considered that , as a young man in good health who had been able to travel independently from GPE , it was not likely to be unduly harsh or unreasonable to expect him to relocate to GPE particularly given that he had married sisters apparently living safely there . Finally , the immigration judge considered that the second applicant \u2019s failure to claim asylum in GPE damaged his credibility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a Senior Immigration Judge refused an application for permission to appeal to ORG finding that , in a very careful and detailed determination , the immigration judge had given cogent and sustainable reasons , which had been fully open to her on the evidence , for concluding that the second applicant had not left GPE because of persecution and that he could return there without facing a real risk of serious harm . The immigration judge had given ample justification for the adverse credibility findings she had made and had adequately explained why the second applicant would not be at risk in GPE , to where he could viably relocate .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE provide for a right of appeal against an immigration decision made by the Secretary of ORG for ORG , inter alia , on the grounds that the decision is incompatible with the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Appeals in asylum , immigration and nationality matters were until DATE heard by the ORG . Section CARDINAL of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE provided that a party to an appeal could apply to ORG , on the grounds that the ORG had made an error of law , for an order requiring the ORG to reconsider its decision on the appeal . ORG could make such an order if it thought that the ORG may have made an error of law . All applications for reconsideration went through a \u201c filter procedure \u201d , so that an application for reconsideration was first made to an authorised immigration judge of the ORG . If the immigration judge refused to make an order for reconsideration , the applicant was able to renew the application to ORG , which would consider the application afresh .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , appeals in asylum , immigration and nationality matters have been heard by the First - tier ORG . Section CARDINAL of ORG DATE provides a right of appeal to ORG , with the permission of the First - tier ORG or ORG , on any point of law arising from a decision made by the First - tier ORG other than an excluded decision .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that , in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right , courts and tribunals must take into account any case - law from this ORG so far as , in the opinion of the court or tribunal , it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen .", "CARDINAL .

Unless expressly superseded or replaced by a later country guidance determination , country guidance determinations are authoritative in any subsequent appeals so far as that appeal relates to the country guidance issue in question and depends upon the same or similar evidence .", "CARDINAL . In the country guidance determination of ORG ( LAW ) : Indiscriminate violence ) GPE CG [ DATE ] UKAIT CARDINAL , of DATE , the then ORG held that there was not in GPE such a high level of indiscriminate violence that substantial grounds existed for believing that a civilian would , solely by being present there , face a real risk which threatens the civilian \u2019s life or person , such as to entitle that person to the grant of humanitarian protection , pursuant to ORG ) and PERSON ) of the Qualification Directive ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In GPE and others ( minors \u2013 indiscriminate violence \u2013 forced recruitment by ORG \u2013 contact with family members ) GPE CG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( ORG ) , ORG , in a determination dated DATE , concluded , inter alia , that the evidence as to the level of indiscriminate violence affecting civilians generally in GPE which had become available since ORG was not sufficient to show that the guidance given by the ORG in ORG was no longer to be regarded as valid .", "CARDINAL . In ORG ( unattended children ) GPE CG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( ORG ) , published on DATE , ORG found that there could be no doubt that the material before it revealed a deterioration in the security situation in GPE since ORG and others . However , ORG found that there was no evidence to suggest that there was any material difference to the risk to which the adult civilian population was subject in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In AK ( Article PERSON ) ) GPE CG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( ORG ) , promulgated on DATE , ORG reconsidered the evidence as to the applicability of Article CARDINAL(c ) of the Qualification Directive ( see paragraphs DATE below ) and the level of indiscriminate violence affecting ordinary civilians which had become available since ORG . In its examination , ORG examined a large amount of country of origin information , including that set out below at paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and paragraphs CARDINAL . With regard to GPE , ORG found that :", "\u201c As regards GPE , even confining attention to GPE city , given the fact that this has a reported population of CARDINAL and that GPE province does not feature in any list of the most violent provinces , the argument for any engagement of the LAW CARDINAL(c ) threshold , if based primarily on civilian deaths , is even weaker : according to the DATE ORG report , the number of civilian deaths in GPE in DATE was DATE . We remind ourselves that the population of GPE is MONEY . \u201d", "In relation to GPE as a whole , ORG concluded as follows :", "( i ) This decision replaces ORG ( Article PERSON ) : indiscriminate violence ) GPE CG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL as current country guidance on the applicability of Article CARDINAL(c ) to the on - going armed conflict in GPE . ...", "( ii ) Despite a rise in the number of civilian deaths and casualties and ( particularly in the DATE period ) an expansion of the geographical scope of the armed conflict in GPE , the level of indiscriminate violence in that country taken as a whole is not at such a high level as to mean that , within the meaning of Article CARDINAL(c ) of LAW , a civilian , solely by being present in the country , faces a real risk which threatens his life or person .", "( iii ) Nor is the level of indiscriminate violence , even in the provinces worst affected by the violence ( which may now be taken to include Ghazni but not to include GPE ) , at such a level ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the country guidance determination of PM and Others ( GPE \u2013 PERSON - i - Islami ) GPE CG [ DATE ] UKAIT DATE , the then ORG held , in respect of the ability to internally relocate to GPE , as follows :", "\u201c If the appellants show that they have a well founded fear in their home areas it is reasonable to expect them to live in GPE . GPE is a functioning city . It has a government and some security forces . We acknowledge that it is not the role of GPE to protect individuals , but there is an NORP army and a police force and security forces . GPE is not an entirely lawless place . There are houses to rent , at a price ; and despite a fairly high level of unemployment , there is work . The CARDINAL appellants have spent a considerable time in GPE , they are all relatively educated and may well be in a good position to obtain work with the authorities or an NGO or similar . There is no satisfactory evidence that suggests that it would be unreasonable to expect them to live there , or that they would lead other than a relatively normal life . Insofar as LAW is concerned there is no satisfactory evidence that they would be subject to inhuman or degrading treatment or that they would be at real risk of a breach of any of their fundamental human rights in GPE .

In ORG ( ORG \u2013 PERSON - i - Islami \u2013 risk ) GPE CG [ DATE ] UKAIT DATE , the then ORG held that unless there were particular reasons , it would not be unduly harsh to expect an appellant with no individual risk factors to relocate to GPE and assist in the rebuilding of his country .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG has increasingly developed an ability to strike at will almost anywhere ; harassment and targeting of \u201c collaborators \u201d now occurs even in the cities , even if on a small scale in GPE and in the north and west . Those who fled and have given up their jobs , as well as their family members , do not appear to have been actively targeted in the cities . The ORG potentially has the resources and skills to track down people , particularly if these are not in hiding but have to work ; extensive infiltration of the police also helps the ORG \u2019s information gathering efforts . However , these escapees who no longer collaborate for the government are a low priority target to the ORG , whose assets in the cities are limited and usually devoted to high profile targets , ranking from serving government officials upwards . In GPE , for example , colonels of the police and army have been targeted , as well as commanding officers of the security services . In the provinces , particularly in the south , government officials of any rank , even low ones , have been targeted . The ORG do not seem to systematically transfer information about targeted individuals from CARDINAL area to the other ; they maintain no databases . What typically happens is that the ORG operating in a specific area will request information from other ORG about a suspect individual , whenever needed . The flow of information therefore depends on the intensity of ORG operations : the greater the presence , the greater the request of information . Often individuals apprehended by the ORG as suspect spies are asked to provide references in order to verify their identity and activities . The risk to the escapees from ORG controlled areas seems to derive mainly from chance contact with the ORG , who may consider them an opportunity target . Usually the poorest and the NORP - populated areas of the big cities are the places where most ORG infiltration of the cities occurs ; in GPE these are GPE suburb , south - eastern GPE , southern GPE and parts of western GPE . In central GPE , the ORG are known to have developed a network of informers , among else buying shops in strategic locations and staffing them with members and sympathisers , the purpose being to observe embassies and government buildings . Such effort is clearly geared towards high value targets and collaborators . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the report set out the main factors affecting the security and human rights of NORP civilians and stated as follows :", "\u201c The ORG have been consistently expanding their information gathering operations ; some parts of the country , in particular the south but also the south - east , the east and the provinces south and west of GPE ( PERSON , PERSON ) are thoroughly covered and there is little that the ORG do not know , not least because they have extensively infiltrated the police and the state administration . In other parts of the country , like most of GPE , most of the west and most of the north , the ORG \u2019s presence on the grounds is more modest and their ability to collect information more limited . More importantly , the ORG \u2019s ability to auction off the information collected is more limited in these areas , where they have to rely on a few hit teams in order to carry out their strategy of targeted killing . As a result , while the ORG target even low level collaborators in the areas where they are present in force , they limit themselves to high profile targets elsewhere . Killings of low profile collaborators of the government is not being reported in these areas . We can expect the policy of targeted intimidation and killing to continue expanding , but the rate of expansion will depend on the ability of the ORG to establish a strong presence in ever newer areas . There are already some areas of the regions less affected by the insurgency , where the ORG are able to extensively target collaborators : a few suburbs of GPE , NORP - populated areas of the north , etc . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
