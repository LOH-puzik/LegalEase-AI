The police supervising the scene called on the applicant either to remove the banner or leave .

The court was satisfied that his conduct had been of a provocative nature , likely to result in unruliness in the context of the ongoing NORP demonstration , and that his right to free expression could not be considered as reaching so far as to cause prejudice to public order . Despite the opinion of a heraldic expert , submitted by the applicant and stating that the flag in question was a historical one , the court considered its display offensive in the circumstances , because it had been placed higher than the national flag representing GPE .

Here , unlimited access for everyone means that both the participants in the assembly and everyone else who does not participate therein should have equal access to the public ground .

Since [ the Report of the third monitoring cycle ] , and apparently building on , at least in part , a series of highly charged anti - government demonstrations at DATE , there has been a disturbing increase in racism and intolerance in public discourse in GPE . In particular , the creation and rise of the radical right - wing ORG ( PERSON ) \u2013 a group bearing close ties to a well known radical right - wing political party \u2013 is consistently cited as a cause for deep concern .

In the circumstances of this specific case , it is evident from the information provided by the parties that the gathering of several individuals at the site of the welcoming ceremonies for a foreign head of ORG on an official visit , publicly announced in advance by ORG authorities , can not be regarded as a demonstration . Insofar as ORG contends that displaying a banner turns their presence into a demonstration , the ORG notes that any restrictions upon the right to assemble must fall within the limitation provisions of article CARDINAL . A requirement to pre - notify a demonstration would normally be for reasons of national security or public safety , public order , the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . Consequently , the application of NORP legislation on demonstrations to such a gathering can not be considered as an application of a restriction permitted by LAW .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL The right for an individual to express his political opinions , including obviously his opinions on the question of human rights , forms part of the freedom of expression guaranteed by LAW . In this particular case , the author of the communication exercised this right by raising a banner . It is true that article CARDINAL authorizes the restriction by the law of freedom of expression in certain circumstances . However , in this specific case , ORG has not referred to a law allowing this freedom to be restricted or established how the restriction applied to Ms. GPE was necessary to safeguard the rights and national imperatives set forth in article DATE , paragraph CARDINAL ) and ( b ) of the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its decision no . BVerfG , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , ORG of Germany held that , in the light of the specific circumstances arising from the location and time of the demonstration , it was constitutionally acceptable to restrict the route of a planned extreme right - wing rally , despite its prior announcement , in order to defend the dignity of the NORP victims of NORP violence and tyranny . ORG , appreciating the historical origins of GPE , upheld , in derogation from the principle of priority , the restriction of the earlier announced demonstration in favour of a commemorating assembly on the concerned location with special regard to the anniversary of the surrender in World War II .", "CARDINAL . The current position of ORG of GPE is summarised in GPE v. Black , CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL ( DATE ) , in the context of cross burning ( a traditional threatening activity of ORG ) . According to this judgment , the burning of a cross is a \u201c symbol of hate \u201d , regardless of whether the message is a political one or also meant to intimidate . And while cross - burning sometimes carries no intimidating message , at other times the intimidating message is the only message conveyed . The protections afforded by LAW are not absolute , and the government may regulate certain categories of expression , including the ban of a \u201c true threat \u201d . Intimidation , in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word , is a type of true threat , where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death . The fact that cross - burning is a symbolic expression does not resolve the constitutional question . Sometimes the cross - burning is a statement of ideology , a symbol of group solidarity . ORG required effort to distinguish among these different types of cross - burnings and considered the contextual factors that were necessary to decide whether a particular cross - burning was intended to intimidate . ORG went on to state :", "\u201c It may be true that a cross burning , even at a political rally , arouses a sense of anger or hatred among the vast majority of citizens who see a burning cross . But this sense of anger or hatred is not sufficient to ban all cross burnings . As PERSON has stated , \u00ab The lesson I have drawn from my childhood in NORP GPE and my happier adult life in this country is the need to walk the sometimes difficult path of denouncing the bigot \u2019s hateful ideas with all my power , yet at the same time challenging any community \u2019s attempt to suppress hateful ideas by force of law LOC ( GPE v.
