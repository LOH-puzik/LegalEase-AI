The applicant was born in DATE . At the time of lodging his application , he had been placed in a supervised residential facility in GPE ( GPE ) . He was subsequently released .", "CARDINAL . Following CARDINAL convictions for offences including burglary and dangerous assault , in DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of committing offences while in a drunken state . It sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and ordered his detention in a psychiatric hospital under LAW ( see paragraph QUANTITY below ) . The court found that the applicant \u2019s criminal responsibility had been diminished at the time of the acts , owing to infantile brain damage combined with drunkenness . He was detained in psychiatric hospitals in GPE and GPE from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG of DATE . It convicted the applicant of intentionally committing offences while in a drunken state and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , without ordering his detention in a psychiatric hospital . The court , having regard to the findings of a psychiatric expert and the results of a re - examination of the applicant \u2019s brain by new technical means , found that he did not suffer and had never suffered from a pathological mental disorder . He had therefore not acted with diminished criminal responsibility . The court considered that the applicant did not have infantile brain damage , and although he had an abnormal personality , he was neither a psychopath nor an alcoholic .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of dangerous assault , CARDINAL counts of assault , coercion and CARDINAL counts of attempted coercion . All these offences had been committed DATE and DATE . The court sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his preventive detention under LAW of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The Hildesheim Regional Court found that the applicant had attacked his victims in a violent manner . The victims had been almost exclusively male and had included schoolchildren . Some had been acquaintances , but others had not been known to the applicant \u2013 people in bars or those who had been randomly chosen on the street . He had either punched his victims in the face , kicked them in the face when they had fallen to the ground or set an NORP dog on them , which had significantly injured the victims by biting them , sometimes on the stomach and neck . He had attacked CARDINAL homeless people whom he did not know with a knife . They had been sleeping in an abandoned building . He had injured the hand , lip , chest and thigh of CARDINAL and the back and finger of another . Objectively , his victims had not provoked any conflict .", "CARDINAL . The Hildesheim Regional Court , having consulted a psychiatric expert and a psychological expert , found that the applicant had acted with full criminal responsibility at the time most of his offences had been committed , despite his prior consumption of alcohol . Only in relation to CARDINAL of his offences could diminished criminal responsibility as a result of alcohol intoxication not be excluded as a relevant consideration ( Article CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph DATE below ) . However , the consumption of alcohol had not been the cause of his offences . He did not suffer from any other pathological mental disorder within the meaning of LAW . His personality differed from that of the majority of the population in that he lacked empathy and saw himself as a strong and dominating man , without that difference being of a pathological nature . He had a propensity to commit serious violent offences against others , where the victims were significantly injured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having fully served his term of imprisonment , the applicant was placed in preventive detention for the first time , initially mainly in FAC . In view of another prison sentence he had served , by DATE he had spent DATE in preventive detention . On DATE , ORG ordered that his preventive detention should continue .", "CARDINAL . NORP On CARDINAL May CARDINAL the Hildesheim District Court convicted the applicant of assault , finding that he had slapped his daughter in the face while under the influence of alcohol while on home leave from detention , and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant served that sentence in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to the detoxification department of ORG . By a decision of DATE ORG then ordered further preventive detention in a psychiatric hospital ( LAW ) rather than in a detoxification facility , as his rehabilitation could be better promoted there . The applicant was then transferred to the psychiatric department of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The order for the applicant \u2019s continued preventive detention in a psychiatric hospital was subsequently extended . In DATE he was authorised to reside provisionally ( Probewohnen ) in FAC in GPE , a supervised residential facility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again ordered the applicant \u2019s continued preventive detention in a psychiatric hospital , under Article CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the stricter criteria set out by ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE regarding preventive detention beyond the former DATE time - limit during the transitional period lasting until DATE ( see paragraph DATE below ) were met in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder for the purposes of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which was the cause of his previous offences . Following its own critical review , it endorsed the conclusions about the applicant \u2019s mental condition which S. , an experienced and reliable expert in the field of forensic psychiatry , had drawn in his report dated CARDINAL DATE and supplemented on DATE . The expert had completed his report on the basis of case files , as the applicant had refused an examination . S. had stated that , just as at the time of his offences , the applicant still suffered from a dissocial personality disorder with marked psychopathic elements , as defined by the relevant tool for the classification of diseases , the ICD-CARDINAL ( International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems in its current , revised version ) . This diagnosis had further been confirmed by the applicant \u2019s treating doctors at ORG .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG considered that there was a high risk that the applicant , owing to specific circumstances relating to his character and conduct , would commit the most serious violent crimes if released from preventive detention . As had been confirmed by PERSON , there was a danger that he would again threaten the lives of others by attacking them , for instance by kicking his victims in the head or setting a dog on them and inciting it to bite them on the neck and face . That risk was particularly high when the applicant \u2013 whom the expert had concluded abused alcohol without being addicted , as defined by the ICD-CARDINAL \u2013 was drunk . Owing to his dissocial personality disorder , the applicant had hardly any inhibitions with regard to injuring others , as he lacked empathy . As he did not question his own perception of a situation , a misinterpreted situation could lead to his using unlimited force against randomly chosen victims who objectively had not provoked any conflict by their conduct .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that the applicant \u2019s preventive detention was still proportionate . At that time , there was no residential accommodation outside of preventive detention where his conduct could be closely monitored . In view of his conduct , it was already unclear whether he would be permitted to continue residing in his current residential facility in FAC . Having regard to the high risk that the applicant would commit the most serious violent offences upon his release , his preventive detention for a period of DATE was not unreasonable .", "CARDINAL . ORG confirmed that the applicant \u2019s rehabilitation could still be better promoted by detention in a psychiatric hospital than by placement in a preventive detention facility ( Article CARDINALa \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Even though there had been no substantial change in his disorder , there had been some positive development in that he had started residing provisionally in a supervised residential facility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He claimed that his continued preventive detention in a psychiatric hospital breached his constitutional right to liberty . He argued that the strict criteria for continued preventive detention set out by ORG in its leading judgment of CARDINAL DATE were not met . Having regard to the fact that his offences \u2013 committed under the influence of alcohol \u2013 dated back DATE , that he had not drunk alcohol since then , and that the conditions of his detention had been extensively relaxed , the experts and the courts had not convincingly shown that there was a risk that he would commit a serious violent offence again if released . Moreover , it had not been found by the experts or the domestic courts that his alleged mental disorder had caused the offences in question , nor that he was or had ever been an alcoholic .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , without giving reasons , ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the applicant was authorised to reside provisionally in PERSON in GPE , a supervised residential facility . He received regular visits from staff members from ORG . CARDINAL times a week he was allowed to go shopping in GPE for TIME , and once DATE he was allowed to go to ORG for DATE under escort . The applicant continued his work therapy in ORG . He no longer received any specific treatment for his mental condition or the alcohol abuse with which he had been diagnosed . The aim of his stay in the supervised residential facility was to enable him to cope with the requirements of everyday life by drawing on his own resources .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant had to return to ORG following conflict with the staff at FAC . From DATE he resided provisionally in FAC , a supervised residential facility in PERSON , with conditions of detention comparable to those in FAC .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with ORG decision of DATE to terminate his preventive detention , the applicant was released on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-e"]}
