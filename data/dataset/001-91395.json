The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the course of a police operation , an undercover police officer bought a substantial quantity of cannabis from the applicant . The applicant was immediately arrested in accordance with Article CARDINAL of LAW for a violation of the drug circulation rules which constituted an administrative offence laid down in DATE . Following a body search and a search of the applicant \u2019s car , the police found further quantities of the drug .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local police office instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant for drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the GPE ORG of Odessa ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) considered a request by the investigator for the applicant to be placed in pre - trial detention and rejected it . However , it extended DATE applicant \u2019s arrest up to a total of DATE , ordering the investigative authorities to obtain more information on the identity of the applicant and establish further circumstances justifying his detention pending trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention on the ground that the applicant was charged with a serious crime and , if at large , would continue his criminal activity and abscond from the investigation and trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the period of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention until DATE as the investigative authorities needed more time to complete the case file , namely , to complete the biological expert examination , to order and carry out a narcotics forensic examination , to question Mr. Sh . , who was the witness in the case , to familiarise the applicant with the case file , and to draw up the bill of indictment . ORG also found that , given the character of the applicant and the gravity of the crime that had been committed , the preventive measure should be left unchanged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was provided with access to the criminal case file to prepare his defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint against the investigation authorities with ORG , claiming that there had been no legal basis for his detention , in so far as the period of his detention , fixed in the ORG decision of DATE , had expired on CARDINAL DATE and had not been extended . This complaint was joined to the criminal case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant finished studying the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the supervising prosecutor approved the bill of indictment and the case file was referred to ORG for adjudication .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG considered the applicant \u2019s complaint of DATE in the course of the preliminary hearing and found that the applicant \u2019s detention after DATE had been lawful . In particular , the ORG established that during the period DATE and DATE the applicant had been studying the case file and , in accordance with Article CARDINAL of LAW , this period was not taken into account in calculating the overall period of his detention pending trial . It further noted that on DATE the case file had been referred to ORG and therefore the applicant \u2019s complaint was unsubstantiated . ORG did not specify the reasons or legal basis for the applicant \u2019s detention after the case had been referred to the court . At the same hearing ORG considered that there had been no grounds for changing the preventive measure in respect of the applicant , but did not state this conclusion in the operative part of the decision . The preliminary hearing was held in the presence of the prosecutor ; the applicant and his lawyer were absent .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on several occasions in the course of the trial , namely DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE , and CARDINAL DATE , ORG considered the applicant \u2019s requests for release and rejected all of them because he was charged with a serious crime and might abscond from the investigation and trial if at liberty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of drug trafficking and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , having included in the sentence the period of the applicant \u2019s detention from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a separate ruling to the effect that the applicant \u2019s arrest on DATE conducted under LAW had not been lawful since LAW , relied on by the police officers , did not cover drug trafficking and was therefore evidently inapplicable to the applicant , who had been arrested when selling the drug to the undercover agent . ORG notified the Odessa ORG of the established violation of the procedural law committed by the police officers and ordered that an internal inquiry into the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s arrest be carried out .", "CARDINAL . DATE of the ORG prohibits the fabrication , purchase , storage , transport , or dispatch of drugs or psychotropic substances in small quantities without the purpose of trafficking . A breach of this provision is punishable by a fine of up to CARDINAL tax - free DATE incomes .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides , inter alia , that anyone who violates drug - circulation rules may be arrested for TIME for the purpose of drawing up a report on the administrative offence . However , in order to identify the perpetrator of the offence , subject him to a medical examination , clarify the circumstances of purchase of the drugs or psychotropic substances and examine them , the arrest may be extended DATE . In such cases the prosecutor shall be informed of the extension in writing within TIME . In case the arrested person does not have identity documents , the arrest may be extended DATE pursuant to an order of the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides , inter alia , that an arrest on grounds of an administrative offence may be challenged by the aggrieved person before the supervising authority , the prosecutor or the court .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides , inter alia , that the period of detention during pre - trial investigation shall expire on DATE the court receives the case file ; however , the time taken by the accused and his or her representatives to familiarise themselves with the materials in the criminal case file shall not be included in the calculation of the period for which the accused has been detained as a preventive measure .", "Save where the period has been extended pursuant to the procedure established by the ORG , in the event of the expiry of the maximum period of detention as a preventive measure allowed by the ORG , the body of inquiry , the investigator or the prosecutor shall be obliged to release the person from custody without delay .", "Governors of pre - trial detention centres shall promptly release from custody any accused in respect of whom a court order extending the period of detention has not been received by the time the period of detention allowed by the ORG expires . They shall notify the person or body before whom the case is pending and the prosecutor supervising the investigation .", "In DATE this Article was amended as regards the rules on calculation of time , taken by the detainee and his or her representative for studying the case file .", "CARDINAL .
