SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ann Power-Forde;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska", "TEXT": ["The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and are currently in GPE .", "The applicants arrived in GPE in DATE and applied for asylum and residence permits . Before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) they essentially submitted the following . The first applicant had worked as a teacher . In DATE the first applicant , her sister and her adopted daughter had been raped in her home by CARDINAL unknown men and at the same time a hand grenade had been thrown at her husband , P. The incident had taken place DATE after the couple had started enquiring of the authorities how it was that a man , PERSON , who had been convicted of abusing their daughter PERSON ( the third applicant ) in DATE , had been released before serving his entire sentence . The authorities had told them to stop asking questions about the matter and shortly thereafter PERSON had started receiving telephone threats to the effect that the family would be hurt if they did not stop asking about PERSON The first applicant and PERSON had also suspected that PERSON \u2019s phone was tapped . The first applicant suspected that PERSON had been released early from prison in order to spy on the ORG ( Forces ORG , at the time a rebel group ) for the ORG , for which reason the authorities would want to cover up his release by silencing the first applicant and her family . The first applicant added that PERSON and their adopted daughter had left GPE in DATE due to continued threats and were currently in GPE . The applicants were convinced that , if returned to GPE , they would be killed by those who had threatened them . Moreover , the first applicant was worried about how she would be able to protect PERSON ( the sixth applicant ) from it becoming known that she might be the result of the rape . The applicants submitted their passports as well as CARDINAL medical certificates ; CARDINAL issued on DATE which stated that the third applicant had been receiving care following sexual abuse and the other issued on DATE which stated that the first applicant , her sister and adopted daughter had received care following a rape .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application . It did not question that the first applicant , her sister and adopted daughter had been the victims of rape in DATE . However , it found it unsubstantiated that men from the governing party had been responsible for the rapes and the threats against the family . It also considered that it was merely speculation by the first applicant that P. \u2019s telephone had been tapped or that PERSON had been released early to work as a spy for the Government , as she had presented nothing to show that this was actually the case . In the ORG \u2019s view , having regard to what the first applicant had said during the interviews , it rather appeared as if the rapes were acts of revenge on the part of PERSON , carried out by private persons connected to PERSON Here the ORG noted that the first applicant had stated that they had reported the rapes in DATE to the police and that the police had commenced an investigation . It further observed that although sexual violence was a problem in GPE , the number of rapes had decreased during DATE while there was an increase in reports to the police concerning rape . Moreover , PERSON had been prosecuted and convicted of the abuse of the third applicant , which indicated that the NORP authorities were willing and able to deal with the problem . Consequently , the ORG concluded that the applicants were not in need of protection in GPE . ORG also took into account that the case included CARDINAL minor children , of whom the sixth applicant had been born prematurely in GPE . However , she was developing well and there was no indication that there would be problems for her in the future due to the uncertainty as to the identity of her father . In conclusion , ORG considered that there were no exceptional reasons to let the applicants remain in GPE .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , relying on the same grounds as previously and adding that the police report concerning the rapes had not led to anything and that the authorities would not be able to protect them from their assailants . The first applicant stressed that the family had had a good life before the attacks and that they would not have left the country if they had not been forced to . From the way her assailants had spoken to her during the attack , she had understood that they were NORP .", "On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG rejected the appeal . Like ORG , it first noted that the abuse of the third applicant had been investigated and the assailant tried and convicted . Moreover , the police were investigating the rapes of the first applicant , her sister and adopted daughter . Thus , the PERSON authorities were able and willing to help the applicants . The court further noted that the applicants had remained in GPE for DATE after the attack without being the victims of any further attacks and that P. had remained in their home until DATE . In the court \u2019s view , the reasons put forward for the attacks and the threats were pure speculation on the part of the first applicant and not substantiated . Hence , the applicants had failed to show that they were in need of protection in GPE . Even having regard to the fact that the case involved children , the court considered that they could not be granted leave to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL lay judge ( out of CARDINAL lay judges and a professional judge ) dissented . She considered that the first applicant had given a credible and coherent account and that she had thereby shown that she would face a real risk of being persecuted or ill - treated due to her gender if returned to GPE . The applicants should therefore be considered as refugees .", "Upon further appeal , ORG refused leave to appeal on DATE .", "On DATE the applicants lodged a new request for residence permits on the basis that there were impediments to the enforcement of their deportation order . They claimed that the first applicant \u2019s husband had been arrested and taken to the security police , where he had been tortured . ORG rejected the request on DATE . It held that the requirements for examining the request had not been met since , inter alia , the documentation submitted in support of the application consisted of photocopies which had low value as evidence . Moreover , it was not clear from the documents why the first applicant \u2019s husband had been arrested . The decision was upheld by ORG on DATE and on CARDINAL DATE ORG refused leave to appeal . It should be noted that the applicants have failed to submit these decisions to the ORG .", "In DATE the applicants lodged yet another request for residence permits in GPE on the basis that there were impediments to the enforcement of their deportation order . They claimed that the first applicant was unable to care for her children because she was depressed and had been treated for this condition at the psychiatric unit at NORP hospital CARDINAL . The hospital had commenced treating the first applicant with medication and the treatment would continue for DATE . The fourth , fifth and sixth applicants had been placed in a family home by the social services while the second and third applicants remained in the family \u2019s apartment and took care of themselves . Thus , the applicants requested residence permits , or at least a stay of execution of the deportation order for DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the request as it found that the applicants had invoked no new circumstances of importance and that there were no absolute impediments to the enforcement of the applicants\u2019 deportation order .", "In DATE the applicants lodged another new application for residence permits in GPE . The first applicant claimed that she had been threatened by CARDINAL of her assailants by text messages sent to her mobile phone in GPE and she thought he had obtained the number through contacts with NORP in GPE . Moreover , her husband \u2019s family had repudiated her because she had been raped and had had an illegitimate child as a result . The first applicant further invoked her poor mental health and stated that she had attempted to commit suicide by taking an overdose when the NORP police had tried to deport her and her children at DATE .", "The first applicant submitted a medical certificate , dated DATE , by PERSON , psychologist at ORG in GPE , which stated that the psychologist had met the first applicant CARDINAL times and that she had traumas from having been the victim of violence in GPE . The first applicant showed symptoms of ORG ( PTSD ) and depression for which she was taking medication . During DATE she had had a serious crisis reaction after she had been informed that her husband had probably died . She had attempted suicide , for which she had been treated at a closed psychiatric unit for DATE ( in DATE ) . According to the psychologist , the police had fetched the first applicant at her home in GPE in DATE to detain her , awaiting the deportation . However , she had tried to commit suicide in the detention centre by drinking soap mixed with her medication . She had heard voices which had told her that her children had been killed and that she should kill herself . In the psychologist \u2019s view , the applicant was now suffering from PTSD , depression with psychotic symptoms and acute stress .", "On DATE ORG rejected the new request as it found that the applicants had invoked no new circumstances of importance but had only made certain additions and adjustments to their previous claims . Nor did it consider that there were impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order .", "On DATE , the applicants\u2019 lawyer submitted a medical certificate and an extract from the first applicant \u2019s medical records from the Crisis and FAC at ORG , both dated DATE and written by GPE , psychotherapist and docent in psychiatry .", "According to the medical certificate , which was based on the medical records , the first applicant was taking antidepressants and sleeping pills . She heard voices which had prompted her to CARDINAL suicide attempts . She fulfilled the criteria for GPE and depression and was in need of treatment . In the doctor \u2019s view , there were impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order due to the first applicant \u2019s poor mental health , since being deported might cause her to lose her sense of reality and try to commit suicide again .", "ORG considered that this material should be considered as a new request for residence permits and decided to stay the enforcement of the deportation order while it considered the request . Moreover , the ORG found that the information about the first applicant \u2019s poor mental health was of a certain importance , for which reason it assigned ORG , physician and specialist in psychiatry , to examine the first applicant in order to evaluate her state of health and whether an enforcement of the deportation order would be possible from a medical point of view .", "After having consulted the first applicant \u2019s medical records and examined her , PERSON concluded that her mental health problems did not amount to a serious mental disorder and that there was no impediment to the enforcement of the deportation order from a medical point of view . However , he considered that experienced and competent personnel should be present during the deportation as the first applicant \u2019s anxiety could escalate and manifest itself through self - destructive behaviour .", "On DATE ORG , having regard to Dr ORG \u2019s evaluation , decided that there were no impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order and that the applicants could not be granted leave to remain in GPE . It also lifted the stay on the deportation order .", "The provisions applicable in the present case are laid down in LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , GPE ) . The LAW defines , inter alia , the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from GPE as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "The LAW stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . The term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW ) .", "Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This is the case where new circumstances give reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or where there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . If a residence permit can not be granted under these rules , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not having done so . Should the applicable conditions not be met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "Matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are dealt with by CARDINAL instances : ORG , ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , LAW ) .", "ORG Human Rights Practices concerning GPE of DATE , dated DATE , sets out , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c GPE is a constitutional republic with an elected government and a population of CARDINAL . From DATE , the country held elections for all public offices , including the first direct presidential elections since DATE . Following the May CARDINAL Communal Council elections , which the international community characterized as generally free and fair , a coalition of CARDINAL opposition parties alleged massive fraud and called for the annulment of the results and new elections . When the parties\u2019 demands were not met , they withdrew their candidates from the subsequent presidential , legislative , and \" colline \" elections . President PERSON , of the ruling ORG for ORG for ORG ( CNDD - ORG ) party , ran unopposed in the DATE presidential election and was reelected to a second term .", "International observers characterized the elections as generally free and fair , although there were reports of political violence leading up to and throughout the DATE election season . Security forces reported to civilian authorities . There were instances in which elements of the security forces acted independently of civilian control .", "Women", "The law prohibits rape , which is punishable by up to DATE imprisonment ; however , the government did not enforce the law effectively , and rape and other sexual violence against women and girls were problems . The rape of minors , or rape committed by persons who infect their victim with an incurable sexually transmitted disease , is punishable by life imprisonment . Spousal rape is punishable by fines of MONEY ( MONEY ) and CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment .", "Many women were reluctant to report rape for cultural reasons , fear of reprisal , and the unavailability of medical care . Men often abandoned their wives following acts of rape , and rape victims were ostracized . Police and magistrates regularly required that victims provide food for and pay the costs of incarceration of those they accused of rape . According to a DATE report by ORG ( ORG ) , many victims who sought judicial redress faced an unresponsive judicial system , and courts often refused to act on cases without witnesses . Some victims were reportedly required to pay MONEY ( $ MONEY ) , a large sum for most victims , to obtain a certified medical report . Other problems included judges who did not regard rape as a serious crime and a lack of medical facilities to gather medical evidence . According to women \u2019s rights organizations , at times families or communities forced victims to withdraw their complaints and negotiate settlements with the perpetrator or his family outside of the formal judicial system . In other cases the victims were forced by their families and local arbiters to marry their attackers . According to the local ORG , PERCENT of persons responsible for rape were arrested , and of PERCENT were prosecuted . As of DATE the ORG recorded CARDINAL rapists arrested . Of the limited number of cases that were investigated , successful prosecutions of rapists were rare .", "During DATE ORG began compiling rape statistics through decentralized family development centers ( ORG ) throughout the country . According to ORG reports , there were CARDINAL reported cases of gender - based violence as of DATE . The ORG received reports of CARDINAL cases of rape and domestic violence as of DATE , most of which occurred in GPE and its outlying areas . PERSON , equipped in part by ORG and funded by the ORG , received CARDINAL victims during DATE at its center for rape victims in GPE . Of the victims they assisted , PERCENT were raped by persons they knew , including members of their families , cooks , and neighbors . Local and international NGOs , the government , and the ORG claimed the number of rape victims was likely much higher .", "Civil society and religious communities worked to overcome the cultural stigma of rape to help victims reintegrate into families that had rejected them . ORG , the PERSON , the PERSON , and ORG continued to encourage rape victims to press charges and to seek medical care , and international NGOs provided free medical care , mostly in urban areas . The government also raised awareness of the problem through seminars and local initiatives describing the kinds of medical care available ... \u201d", "According to the fifth Report of the Secretary General on ORG in GPE ( document S/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , dated DATE , the security situation , although relatively stable during the period under ORG ( DATE to DATE ) , remains a concern . The incidence of criminal activities remained high , with acts of armed robbery , killings and sexual violence . Those acts are largely attributed to the widespread circulation of weapons , land disputes and the socio - economic situation in the country . During the electoral period , there was a massive deployment of security forces throughout the country .", "ORG reported in its Report DATE GPE that there continued to be a high incidence of rape and other sexual violence against women and girls during DATE .
