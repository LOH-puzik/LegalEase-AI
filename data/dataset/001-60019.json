ORG was responsible for the supervision of all matters relating to penal establishments , with particular reference to the treatment of detainees and compliance with regulations . However , under the system established under LAW , detainees had no formal right of complaint .", "CARDINAL . This situation changed with the entry into force of the new GPE on Prisons in GPE , which provides detainees with a limited right of complaint and by which the mandate of ORG includes supervising the execution of custodial sentences , examining detainees\u2019 complaints and considering other grievances presented by detained persons . Under LAW of the new GPE , compensation may be granted where ORG finds a complaint to be partially or wholly well - founded .", "CARDINAL . Under the system in force at the material time , problems relating to conditions of detention could also be reported to ORG . In the case of unacceptable behaviour taking place in a detention facility , FAC could order an inquiry to be carried out by ORG ( Landsrecherche ) .", "CARDINAL .

The wording of LAW , which entered into force on DATE , is almost identical to Article CARDINAL of the former LAW .", "CARDINAL . If no legal remedy exists under administrative law , the GPE civil courts have traditionally had competence to grant relief against the administration . This competence is based on LAW ( PERSON ORG ) , which reads :", "\u201c Jurisdiction in civil cases involves hearing all disputes over civil rights and debt claims . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In accordance with ORG findings in its leading judgments of DATE and DATE ( PERSON ( GPE ) DATE , p. CARDINAL , and GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL ) on a similar provision in GPE on ORG ) , the GPE courts permit themselves a broad interpretation of the notion of \u201c civil rights \u201d . The right claimed by a plaintiff , and not the relationship between the parties , determines the competence of the civil courts ( ORG , PERSON v. the GPE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) . This means that civil courts are competent to hear disputes under civil law as well as under public law , provided that the protection of a civil right is being sought .", "CARDINAL . The civil courts\u2019 competence as to the lawfulness of acts of the administration is , however , limited where a remedy offering sufficient guarantees for a fair procedure is available under statutory administrative law . Whilst in principle remaining competent , civil courts are to refrain from examining the lawfulness of an administrative act or decision against which an administrative appeal lies . Examination of the lawfulness of such an act or decision is not , however , excluded if the administrative appeal does not offer sufficient guarantees for a fair procedure .", "CARDINAL . On this basis the GPE civil courts consider themselves competent to rule on the lawfulness of acts of the administration when these relate to or are directed against persons in detention .", "CARDINAL . Claims against the administration submitted to the civil courts are , generally speaking , brought in the form of an action for tort ( onrechtmatige daad ) within the meaning of LAW ( Burgerlijk Wetboek ) of GPE and GPE . An act of the administration is unlawful and constitutes a tort under LAW when it is contrary to a rule of international or domestic law which seeks to protect the plaintiff \u2019s interests , or to the general principles of proper administration ( algemene beginselen van behoorlijk bestuur ) , which in GPE are for the most part unwritten legal standards with which acts of the administration must comply . Where civil courts are competent , it is possible to request the court , in summary civil proceedings ( kort geding ) , to take an interim measure .", "CARDINAL . The Convention , which according to the domestic courts\u2019 case - law is directly applicable in the legal order of GPE , is frequently used by the civil courts in their examination of claims that an act of the administration is unlawful .", "CARDINAL . In a decision taken on CARDINAL DATE in summary civil proceedings brought by CARDINAL inmates of GPE , ORG of ORG reviewed inter alia a claim for unlimited correspondence rights under LAW ( Rietwijk et al . v.

The special position of detainees simply renders such interference necessary .", "It has been established that the < prison > direction does not allow detainees from GPE to write CARDINAL letters per week and that , for detainees from abroad , the maximum amount has been set at DATE . It is further the rule for all detainees that they may send DATE cards per year at public expense and CARDINAL extra at their own expense .", "Also in the assessment of these limitations , the special position of detainees may be taken into consideration . The circumstance that all letters , both incoming and outgoing , must be censured constitutes a ground of justification for the limitations submitted . It has been established that the director , by virtue of LAW , is empowered to limit the fundamental right in this sense . The claim is consequently rejected . \u201d", "ORG did , however , find in favour of the detainees on a number of other claims : It ordered the defendant to allow each detainee to have visits of TIME , to cover an open sewer in the prison \u2019s courtyard and to ensure the availability of health care services for DATE hours per week . It further prohibited the defendant from placing detainees in a punishment cell for DATE . Such cells must anyway have daylight and a water supply .", "CARDINAL . In a decision taken on DATE in summary proceedings taken by CARDINAL detainees who did not explicitly invoke the LAW , the First Instance Court of GPE set out the conditions under which a person could be held in pre - trial detention ( voorlopige hechtenis ) in the ORG Canario police cell complex . As these conditions were not met , it issued an interim measure prohibiting the defendant from keeping CARDINAL of the CARDINAL plaintiffs ( the other CARDINAL having been transferred already ) in detention in this complex .

The requested prohibition on imposing collective and corporal punishments shall also be ordered .", "CARDINAL . The < GPE authorities > have not denied that collective punishments have been applied , but have pointed out an emergency situation that may occur . That it is sometimes impossible to find out who in a shared cell has committed a prosecutable offence is no justification for punishing everyone concerned ; in this way innocent people are knowingly punished , and that can never be justified .", "CARDINAL . And it is further established that corporal punishments have been administered , not only on the basis of declarations made during the trial that have been hardly disputed , but also on the basis of ORG the contents of which have not been disputed . Corporal punishments are prohibited under conventional - law provisions .", "CARDINAL . The claims will therefore be granted . Given the nature of the prohibition , no maximum limit shall be fixed for the default fine concerning the prohibition on corporal punishment .", "CARDINAL . In this connection it is further considered that , in so far as the interests of < the plaintiffs > in granting < their claims > do not lie in offences already committed , their interests lie in the prevention thereof since the danger that these < offences > will reoccur is apparently real .", "CARDINAL . The question remains whether a default fine must be attached to this ruling .", "CARDINAL . The defence of the < GPE authorities > that they will voluntarily comply with judicial ruling is not credible ; the < GPE authorities > have apparently done nothing about the orders contained in the judgment of DATE . This pleads in favour of imposing default fines .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL . ... nothing has induced the < GPE authorities > to do something about the worrisome wrongs in GPE .

If the < GPE authorities > realise that a wide variety of measures are required to guarantee the physical security and the mental and physical health of detainees ... then they receive a judicial order and nevertheless fail to do what is urgently required of them , the question arises whether a default fine would be of any help .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the reason to impose a default fine is that , within the framework of the present summary proceedings , no other coercive measure is available and < the plaintiffs > can not be denied the right to try now to obtain enforcement of the orders which have been granted ... \u201d", "ORG found in favour of the plaintiffs on all claims and set a default fine of NAF CARDINAL for DATE of failure to respect any of the orders or prohibitions to the detriment of CARDINAL of the plaintiffs up to a maximum of NAF CARDINAL per plaintiff , and a default fine of NAF CARDINAL for each time the prohibition on corporal punishment was not respected as regards any of the plaintiffs .", "CARDINAL . Following a violent incident on DATE at GPE in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , CARDINAL detainees brought tort proceedings against the authorities of GPE .

The CPT Report of DATE on its second visit to GPE from DATE , in which the ruling of DATE by ORG of Cura\u00e7ao ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) is mentioned , concluded that the material conditions of detention in GPE remained unsatisfactory and the ORG called upon GPE authorities to take immediate steps to draw up a comprehensive strategy to combat violence in all its forms at FAC and that this strategy be vigorously implemented without delay . It also recommended that GPE authorities redouble their efforts in inter alia reducing the overcrowding and improving the overall state of repair of the detention areas ( including the sanitary facilities ) . The ORG further recommended that immediate steps be taken to ensure that every prisoner would be supplied with a mattress at TIME .", "CARDINAL . Certain positive developments concerning ORG contacts with the outside world were noted by the ORG delegation , particularly as regards improved access to a telephone and the possibility offered to some prisoners of having supervised open visits .

The CPT Report of CARDINAL DATE on its third visit to GPE from DATE records that , as had been the case in DATE , health care staff insisted that many cases of violence went unreported and that apparently efforts to keep a precise record of cases of violence waned during DATE .

Although there were CARDINAL members of staff , in practice CARDINAL were available DATE . The reason for this considerable absenteeism was reportedly the failure to deal quickly enough with staff matters ( payment of overtime , child allowances , salary adjustments , posting allowances , maintenance costs , etc . ) .
