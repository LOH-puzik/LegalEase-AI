On DATE T. , a DATE boy , described to S. , a psychologist , that he had experienced improper touching while in DATE care and referred to the applicant in this connection . The interview was recorded on videotape in ORG .", "CARDINAL . DATE the alleged offence was reported to the police . On DATE , T. was interviewed again by S. , on that occasion in the course of the pre - trial investigation which had been opened . That interview was also recorded on videotape .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was questioned on CARDINAL and DATE . He was not aware of the existence of the above recordings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE S. submitted a written opinion on the credibility of ORG 's statements .", "CARDINAL . In his closing argument on an unspecified date the applicant contested the alleged improper touching . He noted that the videotape , which he had become aware of following the submission by QUANTITY of the above - mentioned written opinion , and the opinion itself , were indirect evidence , which in the light of the LAW had to be treated with extreme care . He questioned whether the questions put to the boy had not been leading in nature . He also submitted that the boy would have to be heard in court , should charges be brought . He did not request an additional investigation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was charged with having indecently touched the boy when working at DATE nursery which the boy attended . The alleged offence had taken place repeatedly over a period of DATE beginning in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The video recording was played back in ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) and the court heard evidence from the applicant , ORG 's mother and PERSON , the psychologist who had interviewed the boy . PERSON , a doctor in psychology specialising in criminology and forensic psychology , who had not interviewed the boy herself , was also heard as a witness . Several other witnesses , including the applicant 's colleagues and the parents of other children in day care , gave testimony . None of the witnesses made any observations on the alleged acts . The parents gave evidence only on the perceived changes in their children 's personality . The psychologist testified only about the reliability of ORG 's statements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of sexual abuse and sentenced him to a suspended term of DATE imprisonment . It reasoned :", "\u201c ...", "S. has interviewed ORG and the interviews have been recorded on videotape . The videotape has been played back in ORG where witnesses DATE have also seen it . PERSON have been heard as witnesses and [ the applicant ] has had an opportunity to put questions to them . The fact that [ the applicant ] had no opportunity to put questions to T. , for example during the pre - trial investigation , does not mean that the above - mentioned evidence could not be taken into account . At the time of the pre - trial investigation ORG was DATE and he had his seventh birthday in DATE . Thus , he could not be heard before the court . Even though [ the applicant ] has had no opportunity to put questions directly to ORG , the rights of the defence can not be considered to have been jeopardised . In the light of the evidence submitted to it , ORG has no doubt that [ the applicant ] is guilty [ ... ] .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant , the prosecution and the complainant appealed , arguing that the lower court had based his conviction on ORG 's testimony as given to his mother and also later recorded on videotape . He requested the appellate court to hold that this indirect evidence could not be used in evidence . He also repeated his view that leading questions may have been put to the boy . He stated that his right to examine witnesses had been violated as he had not had an opportunity to put questions to T.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , having held an oral hearing , upheld the conviction but increased the sentence to DATE imprisonment with immediate effect . It found that the technical quality of the videotape , which had been played back in the court , was poor as regards its image and sound reproduction and that the contents of ORG 's statements could not be reliably assessed merely on the basis of that recording . The recording however showed that PERSON had carried out the interview without any preconceived idea of its outcome . The statements of CARDINAL of the applicant 's colleagues showed that it would have been possible for the applicant to have acted as described in the indictment without anyone noticing . The statements of ORG 's mother and other day care children 's parents showed that there had been changes in their children 's behaviour after they had been in contact with the applicant . The court did not mention the applicant 's argument that he had not been able to put questions to T.", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal , arguing that he had not been afforded an opportunity to put questions to T. The indirect evidence should therefore have been rejected .", "CARDINAL .

The competence to decide on investigation measures requested by a party lies with the head of investigation during the pre - trial investigation and with the public prosecutor after the case has been transferred to him or her ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . A pre - trial investigation has to be carried out in such a manner that no one is placed under suspicion without due cause and no one is unnecessarily subjected to harm or inconvenience .

At the time of the proceedings in question , there were no legal provisions concerning the use as evidence of a video recording of a statement given by a child during the pre - trial investigation .
