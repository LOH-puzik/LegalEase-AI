NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Ms K. Lea , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , the applicant was a schoolteacher with DATE of teaching experience . In DATE he was diagnosed with depression and granted sick leave from work . He returned to work in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following provocative behaviour from several pupils in his class , he assaulted a pupil with a dumbbell . The pupil sustained a serious head injury requiring hospital treatment . It was also alleged that during the incident the applicant had kicked a female pupil and thrown the dumbbell at another pupil . The applicant was arrested and remanded into custody .", "CARDINAL . He was subsequently charged with attempted murder and grievous bodily harm with intent under LAW of the Offences against LAW . He pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm ( without specific intent ) under LAW CARDINAL of LAW . On DATE he was found not guilty of attempted murder and of grievous bodily harm with intent following a jury trial in ORG . At the sentencing hearing on DATE , the judge sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL GPE community service , taking into account the time spent in pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . The judge referred to significant mitigation in the case , including the applicant \u2019s depressive illness , difficult personal and family circumstances at the relevant time and his previously unblemished record of teaching over DATE . The judge declined to make a disqualification order against the applicant precluding him from working with children , on the basis that he was satisfied that the applicant was unlikely to commit any further offence against a child , largely because as a teacher he was subject to a professional code of practice and disciplinary arrangements and he had recognised that his career teaching children was over .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following disciplinary proceedings , the applicant was dismissed from his post for gross misconduct .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local authority referred the matter to ORG ( \u201c ISA \u201d ) , a body established by LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , to consider whether to bar the applicant from working with children or vulnerable adults . Meanwhile , the applicant commenced voluntary work at a small local charity , run by the ORG , providing support to homeless persons .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , the ORG informed the applicant that it had received the referral and was minded to bar him from working with children and vulnerable adults in light of his conviction . He was therefore invited to make written representations as to why he should not be barred . He submitted written representations through his solicitors on DATE and disputed that he represented a threat to children when operating in a supervised environment , or a threat to vulnerable adults in any circumstances .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the ORG notified the applicant of its decision to include the applicant \u2019s name in both the Children \u2019s Barred List and Adults\u2019 Barred List . It referred to his conviction and considered that he had engaged in conduct which had endangered a child and which constituted \u201c relevant conduct \u201d , within the meaning of LAW , justifying inclusion in the barred lists .", "CARDINAL . As regards the risk to vulnerable adults , the letter stated :", "\u201c We also remain of the view that you may harm a vulnerable adult and it is appropriate to include you on ORG . This is because vulnerable adults with learning difficulties or mental health issues could exhibit similarly challenging behavioural traits as children in certain situations . There are insufficient reassurances that should you engage in \u2018 regulated activity\u2019 in a vulnerable adult setting , you would not pose a similar significant risk to those in your care . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The accompanying \u201c Barring Decision Process \u201d document , prepared by an ISA case worker , reviewed the applicant \u2019s conduct and the risk he posed . The document explained that the applicant was considered to pose a significant risk to children if placed in a similar situation in the future . As regards vulnerable adults , the document stated :", "\u201c It would not be unreasonable to surmise that vulnerable adults , particularly those with learning difficulties or mental health issues , could exhibit similar challenging behavioural traits in certain situations . Because of this there are real concerns that [ the applicant ] might react in a similar manner as he did at [ school ] , if he was placed in a difficult position with vulnerable adults . While there is no evidence to indicate that he has worked in a paid or voluntary capacity with vulnerable adults in the past , he might in the future and his risk is such at the present time that he would pose a risk of harm if he was allowed to do so . [ The applicant \u2019s ] harmful behaviour clearly constitutes risk of harm and a minded to bar decision is proportionate on ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to whether it was appropriate to bar the applicant from working with children or vulnerable adults , the document concluded that it was . In particular , as regards the bar on working with vulnerable adults , the document stated :", "\u201c There is no evidence to indicate that [ the applicant ] has worked in paid or voluntary capacity with vulnerable adults in the past . However , consideration needs to be given to whether it would be appropriate for him to work in regulated activity within a vulnerable adults setting in the future . It is important to consider if [ the applicant ] was to obtain employment with vulnerable adults with learning difficulties or mental health issues , they could exhibit similar challenging behavioural traits as children in certain situations . There is a potential , significant risk that if he was placed in a similarly difficult situation in a vulnerable setting he could react in a similar manner with potential fatal consequences . Therefore it is deemed appropriate to include [ the applicant \u2019s ] name on ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently ceased his voluntary work with the homeless charity , having received legal advice that the work was potentially contrary to the ORG barring decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed the decision to include him in LOC to ORG . He did not appeal the decision to include him in LOC . He argued that the ORG had wrongly found that he had kicked a female pupil and that the decision to bar him from working with vulnerable adults was disproportionate and thereby in breach of LAW . He obtained a report from a consultant psychiatrist , PERSON , to assist the tribunal to assess his level of risk . The report confirmed that the applicant \u2019s diagnosis was one of a recurrent depressive disorder and that as a result of depression and considerable work stress he had assaulted his pupil in DATE . It noted that , since that time and with medical assistance , his situation had significantly improved .", "CARDINAL . Following receipt of the psychiatric report , the parties requested that the proceedings be stayed in order to allow the ORG to review its decision . A stay was granted .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the ORG confirmed its decision to include the applicant \u2019s name on ORG but retracted its finding of fact that the applicant had kicked a female pupil in light of further inquiries into that incident . The ORG review letter noted that Dr PERSON \u2019s report showed that , since the incident , the applicant had taken significant steps to address his long - term issues with depression through psychiatric support , psychotherapy and support from his general practitioner . However , while acknowledging the significant progress that he had made , the letter emphasised that a relatively short period of time had elapsed since this marked improvement . Although PERSON report was compelling , it was also apparent from the report that he believed that \u201c some basic safeguards would seem prudent \u201d to mitigate against future risk . The ORG concluded that Dr PERSON \u2019s report served to strengthen its view that there continued to be an unacceptable risk , noting that the report proposed a risk assessment for any post for which the applicant wished to apply and recorded the applicant \u2019s recognition of the fact that he should not work alone . The ORG noted that it had no scope to impose a \u201c partial bar \u201d or any type of restriction on the applicant which would allow the recommendations made by PERSON to be incorporated into any future employment and , accordingly , it had to balance the level and nature of the risk identified against the impact on the applicant of continued inclusion on ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the ORG decision to include the applicant \u2019s name in ORG . It commented that the ORG caseworker had not specifically addressed proportionality in the context of the decision - making process . The tribunal considered the correct approach to its review of the ORG decision was that set out in its previous judgment in ORG , at that time pending before ORG ( see further \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d , below ) , namely that it should examine the evidence and allocate weight to it , and decide whether the balance had been struck in the right place . It noted that the ORG had not had the opportunity of hearing the applicant give evidence whereas the tribunal , with CARDINAL experienced , specialist members , had heard his evidence and tested it in some detail . It considered that the ORG had \u201c fundamentally misconstrued \u201d PERSON report since the tribunal failed to see how that report could have strengthened ORG \u2019s view that there continued to be an unacceptable risk . It was of the view that PERSON suggestion that there be a basic risk assessment before the applicant was engaged in work with vulnerable adults was a very sensible one and one which , the tribunal understood , would in any event be carried out by ORG in respect of the homelessness project in which the applicant was interested .", "CARDINAL . The tribunal therefore directed the ORG to remove the applicant \u2019s name from ORG . It also directed that :", "\u201c ... there is to be no publication of the any matter likely to lead members of the public directly or indirectly to identify any person , including the Appellant , who has been involved in the circumstances giving rise to this Appeal \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed to ORG on CARDINAL grounds , namely : ( i ) that ORG had erred in law in its approach to proportionality by failing to give appropriate weight to the ORG decision ; ( ii ) that the ORG decision was not , as a matter of law , disproportionate ; ( iii ) that ORG had failed to take into account the nature of the risk posed by the applicant ; and ( iv ) that ORG had erred in placing reliance on safeguards in place at the applicant \u2019s proposed place of work and had failed to take into account the risk that would be posed if the applicant worked with vulnerable adults in other environments .", "CARDINAL . ORG subsequently handed down judgment in ORG , overturning the judgment of ORG in that case and clarifying the correct approach to be taken when reviewing an ORG decision ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d , below ) .", "CARDINAL . The functions of the ORG were transferred to ORG in DATE and the appeal continued in the latter \u2019s name .", "CARDINAL . In his skeleton argument of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant invited ORG to uphold the decision of ORG that the decision to include him in the Adults\u2019 Barred List was disproportionate and thus unlawful . He argued , in particular , that proportionality had always to involve the striking of a fair balance between the rights of the individual and the interests of the community , inherent in the whole of the LAW ; that where the individual had not been interviewed by the primary decision - maker , the appellate authority was much better placed to investigate the facts and test the evidence ; that it was for the court before which the issue was raised to decide whether Convention rights had been breached and that this court was not merely to concern itself with whether the primary decision - maker took the relevant rights into account ; and that the court had to treat with appropriate respect the views of those who had the primary responsibility to make the judgments in question , especially where they had addressed their minds to the relevant issues .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of ORG and reinstated the ORG decision . Lord Justice PERSON , delivering the lead judgment ( with which the other CARDINAL members of ORG agreed ) , considered that the process through which the ORG had worked in coming to its judgment that the applicant should be included on ORG was a \u201c thorough and careful \u201d one . That view had then been reviewed in the light of PERSON evidence , and the confirmed conclusion had \u201c appropriately recognised the force of Dr M. \u2019s evidence in relation to the improvement in [ the applicant \u2019s ] condition , but went on , after due consideration of the whole picture , to conclude that it did not provide a reason for reversing the decision , and if anything strengthened it \u201d . The judge continued :", "\u201c DATE . I have found in the documentation relating to the ORG \u2019s decision - making the clearest evidence of careful thought and reasoning . I therefore find ORG view that the ORG had not given any detailed thought to its decision and that it had failed to carry out a balancing exercise to be very surprising . It seems to me to be clearly wrong .", "CARDINAL . Very considerable reliance was placed by ORG on Dr M. \u2019s report and the ORG is criticised for having \" misconstrued the evidence of PERSON . Insofar as ORG placed additional reliance on the fact that it had heard oral evidence from PERSON , I accept the submission of [ the applicant \u2019s lawyer ] that in reality this does no more than confirm the evidence already before the tribunal from PERSON to the effect that PERSON had improved and was currently well motivated to avoid a repetition of his conduct . However , it seems to me that ORG reliance on PERSON evidence , together with its dismissal of the ORG \u2019s approach to it , was misconceived . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He also found that ORG was wrong to treat the ORG \u2019s view of the safeguards mentioned by PERSON as strengthening its case . He noted that the safeguards mentioned related to a man whose condition had improved , but only in the context of a person suffering from a recurrent depressive disorder and whose improvement was over a relatively short time span . These considerations , which weighed with the ORG , appeared to have been ignored by ORG , which had also concluded that the safeguards \u201c will be in place \u201d , thus rendering an absolute bar disproportionate . However , the judge noted , there was no guarantee whatsoever that the safeguards which PERSON thought prudent and which would exist under the aegis of the work which the applicant envisaged would necessarily apply in other employments or other situations . The judge considered that ORG assertion that those safeguards would be in place could not safely be made , nor could the safeguards be implemented as conditions attaching to any future work with vulnerable adults .", "CARDINAL . The judge saw \u201c considerable force \u201d in the ORG \u2019s argument that ORG had not taken the approach to proportionality mandated by ORG in ORG , which required it to accord weight to the judgment of the ORG . The judge therefore concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The effect of the ORG \u2019s decision was wrongly to characterise the ORG \u2019s decision as an error of law . There was , in my judgment , no such error made by the ORG whose valid decision was wrongly quashed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In these circumstances , ORG considered that it was not appropriate to remit the case to ORG and instead ordered that the decision of the ORG be restored .", "CARDINAL . ORG also observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . There have been amendments to LAW pursuant to ORG since the ORG decision . However , none of those amendments impacts upon this appeal or the question of the correctness of ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . A recent change which will have an impact for the Respondent is that , whereas previously ORG \u2019s decision would not be subject to review for DATE , the position has now been altered so that a review may take place at any time if new information emerges , or there has been a change of circumstances , or it becomes apparent that ORG has made an error . See Section CARDINALA of LAW as inserted by LAW DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought permission to appeal from ORG . He argued , inter alia , that the DATE scheme was unlawful in failing to provide for a full - merits review on appeal . If there was no requirement for a fullmerits review on appeal , then at the very least ORG had to be permitted to carry out a robust proportionality exercise . In his submission , if the narrow remit afforded by ORG to ORG in his case were left undisturbed , this would mean that the barring scheme was incompatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . He further argued that the scheme was unlawful in that it did not allow ORG to implement a partial bar on working with vulnerable adults ( the \u201c all - or - nothing \u201d ground ) . The absolute bar that it was obliged to impose was disproportionate and in breach of LAW . The Disclosure and Barring Service therefore had to be empowered to impose a partial bar so that in appropriate cases individuals could only be excluded from positions where they would pose a significant risk to the relevant vulnerable group . If no such power could be read into LAW then a declaration of incompatibility under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d , below ) should be made .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused permission to appeal . It stated that the application did not raise a point of law of general public importance and that the \u201c all - or - nothing \u201d ground did raise a point of law of general public importance but that it was too late to raise it at this stage .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act and its Schedule CARDINAL created the ORG , to consist of a chairman and members appointed by the Secretary of ORG who appeared to him to have knowledge or experience of any aspect of child protection or the protection of vulnerable adults . Appointment was for a term not exceeding five years and a member could be removed by the Secretary of ORG on various specified grounds , including that he was unable or unfit to carry out his functions .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW requires the ORG to keep CARDINAL lists of individuals deemed unsuitable to work with children and vulnerable adults respectively . Section CARDINAL provides that a person whose name has been included on one of the barred lists is precluded from taking part in \u201c regulated activity \u201d with the relevant group . LAW CARDINAL define \u201c regulated activity \u201d . The definition of \u201c regulated activity \u201d was amended by ORG to focus on work which involves close and unsupervised contact with vulnerable groups , thus reducing its scope . Section CARDINAL makes it an offence for a person included in the barred lists to engage in \u201c regulated activity \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The criteria for inclusion in the barred lists are set out in Schedule CARDINAL . Under paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL , ORG ( formerly the ORG ) is obliged to include a person in the Children \u2019s Barred List if satisfied , following consideration of representations by the affected person , that he has engaged in \u201c relevant conduct \u201d and that it is appropriate to include him in the list . \u201c Relevant conduct \u201d is defined in paragraph CARDINAL as including conduct that endangered a child .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL provides that ORG ( formerly the ORG ) is obliged to include a person in ORG if satisfied , following consideration of representations , that he has engaged in conduct which fell within paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and that it is appropriate to include him in the list . Paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides as follows :", "\u201c A person falls within this sub - paragraph if he may\u2014", "( a ) harm a vulnerable adult ,", "( b ) cause a vulnerable adult to be harmed ,", "( c ) put a vulnerable adult at risk of harm ,", "( d ) attempt to harm a vulnerable adult , or", "( e ) NORP incite another to harm a vulnerable adult . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides for a right of appeal to ORG against a decision to include a person in the barred lists . For the purposes of determining appeals , ORG sits with a constitution of one legally - qualified judge and CARDINAL specialist , non - legal members .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW stipulates that an appeal can only be made on the grounds that the ORG has made a mistake on a point of law or in a finding of fact on which the decision was based . In section CARDINAL ) , the decision whether it was appropriate for a person to be included in a barred list is stated to be neither a question of law nor of fact .", "CARDINAL . Paragraphs DATE and CARDINALA of Schedule QUANTITY allowed a person included in a barred list to apply to ORG ( formerly the ISA ) for a review of his inclusion . At the time the applicant was placed on ORG , a review could only proceed after the end of the \u201c minimum barring period \u201d , which in the applicant \u2019s case was a DATE period , and with the permission of ORG .", "CARDINAL . However , following amendments introduced by ORG , a review may now take place at any time and a person \u2019s name is to be removed from the list if ORG is satisfied that , in the light of information which it did not have at the time of inclusion in the list , any change of circumstances or any error by ORG , it is not appropriate for the person to be included in the list .", "CARDINAL . In R ( ORG ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) , the claimants argued that the scheme established by LAW did not permit an oral hearing and thus did not comply with LAW ; and did not give individuals placed on a barred list the opportunity for a full merits review on appeal , contrary to LAW Mr Justice PERSON , sitting in ORG , said :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In light of the fact that ORG can put right any errors of law and any material errors of fact and , further , can do so at an oral hearing if that is necessary for the fair and just disposition of the appeal I have reached the conclusion that the absence of a right to an oral hearing before the [ ISA ] and the absence of a full merits based appeal to ORG does not infringe LAW . To repeat , an oral hearing before the [ ISA ] is permissible under the statutory scheme and there is no reason to suppose that in an appropriate case the [ ISA ] would not hold such a hearing ... Indeed , a failure or refusal to conduct an oral hearing in circumstances which would allow of an argument that the failure or refusal was unreasonable or irrational would itself raise the prospect of an appeal to ORG on a point of law . Further , any other error of law and relevant errors of fact made by the [ ISA ] can be put right on an appeal which , itself , may be conducted by way of oral hearing in an appropriate case .", "CARDINAL . NORP I am more troubled by the absence of a full merits based appeal but I am persuaded that its absence does not render the scheme as a whole in breach of LAW for the following reasons . First , the [ ISA ] is a body which is independent of the executive agencies which will have referred individuals for inclusion / possible inclusion upon the barred lists . It is an expert body consisting of a board of individuals appointed under regulations governing public appointments and a team of highly - trained case workers . Paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of Schedule DATE CARDINAL Act specifies that the chairman and members \u2018 must appear to the Secretary of ORG to have knowledge or experience of any aspect of child protection or the protection of vulnerable PERSON . The [ ISA ] is in the best position to make a reasoned judgment as to when it is appropriate to include an individual \u2019s name on a barred list or remove an individual from the barred list . In the absence of an error of law or fact it is difficult to envisage a situation in which an appeal against the judgment of the [ ORG ] would have any realistic prospect of success . Second , if the [ ISA ] reached a decision that it was appropriate for an individual to be included in a barred list or appropriate to refuse to remove an individual from a barred list yet that conclusion was unreasonable or irrational that would constitute an error of law . I do not read section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW as precluding a challenge to the ultimate decision on grounds that a decision to include an individual upon a barred list or to refuse to remove him from a list was unreasonable or irrational or ... disproportionate . In my judgment all that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) precludes is an appeal against the ultimate decision when that decision is not flawed by any error of law or fact . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG considered the R ( ORG ) judgment in ORG v. ISA [ DATE ] ORG FAC ( ORG ) . It referred to counsel \u2019s submission that the weight the ORG attached to a particular feature was not a matter which the tribunal could redetermine but rather went to \u201c appropriateness \u201d , expressly excluded by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , and said :", "\u201c CARDINAL . We are not able to agree with this submission . We are mindful that we must read section CARDINAL ) in a way that is compatible with LAW DATE , and the approach adopted by PERSON , in our view , is the correct way to proceed . If a decision taken by ORG to place a person on a list , or not to remove him from the list , is disproportionate to the facts as presented to the [ ISA ] , then there is an error of law , and the ORG on appeal is entitled , indeed obliged , to direct ORG to remove the person from the list , or remit the matter to ORG for a new decision .", "CARDINAL . The only way in which a ORG can form a view as to whether a decision of the [ ISA ] is disproportionate is to engage in \u2018 a weighing of evidence GPE , not so as to ascertain whether the decision is or is not appropriate ( that is a matter solely for the [ ISA ] ) but so as to ascertain whether it is disproportionate and therefore out with the lawful decision making exercise of the [ ISA ] . It is therefore the totality of the evidence that the ORG must concern itself with . In considering the totality of the evidence , it is in our view necessary to look carefully at individual aspects to that evidence and to form a view whether the conclusion that the [ ISA ] has placed on the totality of the evidence is disproportionate .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... On an appeal , the ORG is entitled to examine the evidence and to allocate weight to it and to decide whether the balance has been struck in the right place . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment in ORG was subsequently overturned on appeal . Delivering the lead judgment for ORG on DATE ( [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) , Lord Justice PERSON explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The [ ISA ] assessment was a fair representation of the many indications and counter indications and specific mention was made of the numerous references and the fact that ORG had voluntarily sought counselling .", "CARDINAL . This brings me to CARDINAL particular points . First , there is the fact that , unlike the ORG , the [ ORG ] saw and heard ORG giving evidence . However , it can not be suggested that it was unlawful for the ORG not to do so . It had had at its disposal a wealth of material , not least the material upon which the criminal conviction had been founded and which had informed the sentencing process . The objective facts were not in dispute . Secondly , Mr PERSON , on behalf of ORG , emphasises the fact that the [ ORG ] is not a non - specialist court reviewing the decision of a specialist decision - maker , which would necessitate the according of considerable weight to the original decision . It is itself a specialist tribunal . Whilst there is truth in this submission , it has its limitations for the following reasons : ( CARDINAL ) unlike its predecessor , ORG , it is statutorily disabled from revisiting the appropriateness of an individual being included in a Barred List , simpliciter ; and ( CARDINAL ) whereas the [ ORG ] judge is flanked by non - legal members who themselves come from a variety of relevant professions , they are or may be less specialised than the ORG decision - makers who , by paragraph CARDINAL ) of schedule CARDINAL to LAW \u2018 must appear to the Secretary of ORG to have knowledge or experience of any aspect of child protection or the protection of vulnerable PERSON . I intend no disrespect to the judicial or non - legal members of the [ ORG ] in the present or any other case when I say that , by necessary statutory qualification , the ORG is particularly equipped to make safeguarding decisions of this kind , whereas the [ ORG ] is designed not to consider the appropriateness of listing but more to adjudicate upon mistakes on points of law or findings of fact ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . For all these reasons I consider that the complaint that the [ ORG ] did not accord \u2018 appropriate ORG to the decision of the ORG is justified . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
