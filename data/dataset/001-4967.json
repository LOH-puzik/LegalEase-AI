Administrative proceedings concerning the construction permit for the annex to the applicant \u2019s house", "In DATE ORG ordered the applicant to demolish the annex to his house which he had built , considering that he had not obtained the required construction permit .", "In DATE the decision of ORG was set aside as the applicable laws did not require a permit for a construction of an annex which would not significantly enlarge the original building .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the charges against the applicant were supplemented by further ones . On the whole , he was charged with commission of CARDINAL offences . The Prosecutor ordered the applicant to undergo a psychiatric examination on an out - patient basis . As the psychiatrists found that it was impossible to give an objective assessment of the applicant \u2019s health on the basis of CARDINAL examination and as the applicant refused to comply with the order , on DATE the Prosecutor ordered that he should be placed in ORG psychiatric hospital for DATE observation . This decision was later quashed on the request of the hospital and the applicant \u2019s examination in ORG hospital was ordered .

The ORG found that the applicant had in his numerous letters proffered insults against various persons , including judges , prosecutors , agents of the ORG administration and psychiatrists involved in his psychiatric observations . However , the court observed that the applicant had been involved in many proceedings in which he had acquired a profound conviction that he had become a victim of an insidious and widespread conspiracy against him , and that , as a result , he developed a very strong negative emotional attitude towards the persons acting in their official capacity of ORG organs , bordering on psychosis . Thus , his actions could be regarded as being subjectively justified . On the objective side , the court analysed the applicant \u2019s conduct and considered that , despite its repetitive character and the violence of his verbal insults , it could not be considered as representing a serious danger , and in view thereof found that the applicant had no case to answer .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the Prosecutor ordered the police to arrest the applicant on DATE . The ORG considered that this order had in fact made it impossible for the applicant to comply with the summons to the hospital . The ORG further noted that , given that the criminal proceedings against the applicants had not been conducted diligently and that the applicant had been already questioned on several occasions by the Prosecutor , there was no indication that his arrest was , as argued by the Prosecutor in the order imposing detention on remand , necessary in order to secure the proper course of criminal proceedings . Moreover , there were no indications that the applicant \u2019s remaining at liberty would jeopardise the proper conduct of the proceedings in any manner . The court concluded that the applicant \u2019s detention was unjustified and in breach of the provisions concerning arrest and detention on remand .", "Subsequently the Minister of ORG General lodged an extraordinary appeal against this judgment with ORG .", "On DATE ORG allowed the Minister \u2019s extraordinary appeal , quashed the decision of DATE , considering that in the view of the applicant \u2019s repeated refusals to comply with the summonses to psychiatric examinations , his arrest and detention had been justified .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG imposed on him a fine of CARDINAL PLZ , considering that the appeal contained vulgar insults of the court .", "On DATE ORG set the judgment under appeal aside and discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant . The court found that the findings of fact made by the lower court were well founded . The court went on to state that , taking into account the applicant \u2019s personal situation , the long - standing conflict between the applicant and the victims , the fact that the material events had occurred in broad daylight and in a public place so it had not been likely that the victims could have had a justified fear that he would realise his threats , the danger of the offence was minimal and the proceedings should be discontinued .", "On an unspecified date the applicant lodged with the Suwa\u0142ki Regional Court a civil action for compensation for his arrest on DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action .", "The applicant lodged an appeal . He claimed in particular that he should be awarded compensation in a sum of CARDINAL PLZ .", "On DATE ORG amended the decision under appeal in that it awarded to the applicant a compensation of CARDINAL PLZ . The court observed that on DATE the Prosecutor had ordered that a psychiatric opinion be obtained as to the applicant \u2019s mental health . In DATE the applicant had failed to comply with the summons for an out - patient examination . By a letter of DATE the Prosecutor invited the applicant to report to a hospital for an examination , and on DATE he ordered the police to proceed to the applicant \u2019s arrest in order to ensure that he be examined on DATE . The court considered that the ORG had thereby made it impossible for the applicant to comply with its own invitation to come to the examination of the applicant \u2019s own free will , which was clearly not in accordance with the purposes of arrest as set out by the applicable legal provisions . The court further observed that in the light of these provisions arrest had to be resorted to with prudence , as it was a coercive measure leading to a deprivation of liberty . In the present case , the applicant \u2019s arrest could have been lawfully ordered not earlier than on DATE , i. e , had it become already clear that the applicant had failed to report to the hospital as requested by the ORG \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE . The court referred to LAW ( b ) of the LAW and stated that in the light of the foregoing considerations , the applicant \u2019s arrest had been arbitrary and , consequently , it was not compatible with that provision of the LAW .", "On thesatisfaction .", "The applicant apparently lodged a cassation appeal against this judgment .
