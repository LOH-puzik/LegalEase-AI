{"ITEMID": "001-23210", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "CHANDRA AND OTHERS v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national of NORP origin , born in DATE and living in GPE . The second , third , fourth and fifth applicants , PERSON , PERSON , ORG and GPE \u2013 the first applicant \u2019s children DATE are NORP nationals , born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . They currently live in GPE with their mother . The applicants are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON GPE , a lawyer practising in Hapert .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the first applicant ( \u201c the mother \u201d ) was in the process of getting a divorce from her NORP husband , father of the other applicants ( \u201c the children \u201d ) . She submitted that her husband did not meet his responsibilities as head of the family , was frequently inebriated , abused her and the children , did not provide for basic DATE needs and repeatedly forced her out of the house at knifepoint . On DATE , while the divorce proceedings were still ongoing , the mother left GPE and came to the GPE where she met and settled with a GPE national . On DATE she was granted a residence permit for the specific purpose of living with her partner . The father retained custody of the children who remained with him in GPE . The mother pursued legal proceedings from the GPE in order to obtain a divorce as well as custody of the children .", "In DATE the mother was granted custody of the children , but this decision was appealed by the father . In a final decision of DATE she was granted custody . According to the mother \u2019s submissions , she subsequently started preparations for the children to join her in the GPE . Her partner , however , was reluctant to have the CARDINAL children coming to live with them .", "On DATE the mother obtained GPE nationality . In DATE the relationship between the mother and her partner ended and she settled in a place of her own .", "In DATE the children were granted permission by their father to leave GPE in order to join their mother . On DATE they entered the GPE on a short stay visa ( visum voor kort verblijf ) , granted for the purpose of visiting their mother and valid for DATE . They have been living with their mother since that time . On DATE the children lodged a formal application for a residence permit ( vergunning tot verblijf ) in order to stay with their mother .", "On DATE the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) rejected the children \u2019s request considering that the criteria for family reunion had not been met given that , firstly , the close family ties ( gezinsband ) between mother and children must be considered to have been severed and , secondly , the mother had insufficient means of subsistence . The Deputy Minister also found that this decision did not entail a breach of LAW , since it did not prevent the applicants from continuing to exercise their family life as they had done prior to the children \u2019s arrival in the GPE . Furthermore , there were no impediments for the mother to follow her children to a place outside the GPE .", "On DATE the children filed an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision . On DATE the Deputy Minister informed the children that they were not allowed to await the outcome of their objection in the GPE . On DATE the children filed a request with ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) for a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) that would allow them to remain in the GPE pending the proceedings on their objection .", "On DATE the Deputy Minister rejected the objection . The children subsequently filed an appeal against that decision with ORG , amending their request for a provisional measure in that they now wished to be allowed to await the outcome of the appeal proceedings in the GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal , as well as the request for a provisional measure . It confirmed the Deputy Minister \u2019s assessment that the close family ties between the mother and the children had been severed . ORG held in this respect that the mother had failed to show that close family ties with her children had been maintained either through parental decisions or through financial support , even after she had obtained custody of them . ORG attached particular importance to the fact that it was only in DATE that the mother had taken concrete steps to have her children join her in the GPE and not already in DATE and DATE when she had obtained custody of them .", "ORG saw no merit in the arguments that refusing the children residence would amount to a violation of LAW . In this context it had regard to the fact that the proceedings concerned a request for a first admission ( eerste toelating ) to the GPE , rather than a refusal to extend existing residence . It further held that there were no objective obstacles to the applicants\u2019 family life being exercised elsewhere DATE the mother was free to develop family life with her children in GPE . ORG concluded that a proper balance had been struck between the interests of the applicants and those of society as a whole , the latter interest being served by a restrictive immigration policy .", "As a rule , anyone wishing to apply for a residence permit in the GPE must first apply from his or her country of origin to the GPE Minister of ORG for a provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) . Only once such a visa has been issued abroad may a residence permit for the GPE be granted . An application for a provisional residence visa is assessed on the basis of the same criteria as a residence permit .", "At the time relevant to the present application , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by LAW DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d - Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) . On DATE a new Aliens Act entered into force but this has no bearing on the present case .", "Under LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW , a residence permit may be refused on public interest grounds ( gronden aan het algemeen belang ontleend ) .", "In view of the situation in the GPE as regards population size and employment , Government immigration policy DATE defined at the time in LOC DATE ( \u201c the Circular \u201d - Vreemdelingencirculaire DATE ) DATE is aimed at restricting the number of aliens admitted to the GPE . In general , an application for a residence permit in the GPE is granted only if the individual \u2019s presence serves an essential national interest or if there are compelling humanitarian grounds to do so ( LAW ) .", "The admission policy for family reunion purposes was laid down in LAW of the Circular . It provided that the following persons , where relevant , may qualify for family reunion if certain conditions ( relating to matters such as public policy and means of subsistence ) are met :", "\u2013 a person \u2019s spouse ,", "\u2013 a minor child born of the marriage who actually belongs to the family unit ( gezin ) , and", "\u2013 a minor child born outside the marriage who actually belongs to the family unit ( e.g. a child of CARDINAL of the spouses from a previous marriage or a foster child ) .", "The phrase \u201c actually belonging to the family unit \u201d ( \u201c feitelijk behoren QUANTITY \u201d ) used in GPE law only partly overlaps with the term \u201c family life \u201d in LAW . The former is understood to mean , for instance , that the close family ties ( gezinsband ) between the child and its parents whom it wishes to join in the GPE already existed in another country and have been maintained . For the rest , the question of whether the close family ties should be deemed to have been severed is answered on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each specific case . Factors taken into consideration include the length of time during which parent and child have been separated and the reasons for the separation , the way in which the relationship between parent and child has been developed during the separation , the parent \u2019s involvement in the child \u2019s care and upbringing , custody arrangements , the amount and frequency of the parent \u2019s financial contributions to the child \u2019s care and upbringing , the parent \u2019s intention to send for the child as soon as possible and his / her efforts to do so , and the length of time that the child has lived in a family other than with the parent . Living together in the GPE without a permanent residence permit is not seen as restoring severed family ties ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
