NORP In DATE the GPE city administration authorised a public gathering called \u201c the Right March \u201d by a number of nongovernmental organisations such as ORG and ORG . The declared aim of the event was to commemorate the liberation of GPE from occupation and to express the ORG dissatisfaction with the flow of immigration into GPE . This public event included a parade from the ORG underground station down to FAC , where a demonstration was held . The event lasted for DATE and attracted CARDINAL people , according to the applicants .

There they intended to express their disagreement with the mayor \u2019s office as to the location of the previously planned march and demonstration .
