The applicant was born in GPE in DATE . She currently lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant entered GPE on DATE under an assumed name . She was seriously ill and was admitted to hospital , where she was diagnosed as HIV - positive with \u201c considerable immunosuppression and ... disseminated mycobacterium TB \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE solicitors lodged an asylum application on her behalf , claiming that she had been ill - treated and raped by ORG in GPE because of her association with the Lord \u2019s Resistance Army , and asserting that she was in fear of her life and safety if she were returned .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant developed a second Aids - defining illness , PERSON \u2019s sarcoma . Her CDCARDINAL count was down to CARDINAL ( that of a healthy person is over CARDINAL ) . After treatment with antiretroviral drugs and frequent monitoring , her condition began to stabilise so that by DATE , when ORG examined the case , her CDCARDINAL count had risen to CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a consultant physician prepared an expert report , at the request of the applicant \u2019s solicitor , which expressed the view that without continuing regular antiretroviral treatment to improve and maintain her CDCARDINAL count , and monitoring to ensure that the correct combination of drugs was used , the applicant \u2019s life expectancy would be DATE , due to the disseminated PERSON \u2019s sarcoma and the risk of infections . The medication she needed would be available in GPE , but only at considerable expense and in limited supply in the applicant \u2019s home town of GPE . Moreover , the author of the report pointed out that in GPE there was no provision for publicly funded blood monitoring , basic nursing care , social security , food or housing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG refused the asylum claim on DATE on grounds of credibility , and also because it was not accepted that the NORP authorities were interested in the applicant . The applicant \u2019s LAW claim was also rejected , the Secretary of ORG noting that treatment of Aids in GPE was comparable to that in any other NORP country , and that all the major antiretroviral drugs were available in GPE at highly subsidised prices .", "CARDINAL . An adjudicator determined the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE . He dismissed the appeal against the asylum refusal , but allowed the appeal on LAW grounds by reference to the case of NORP v. GPE ( DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL ) . He found that the applicant \u2019s case fell within the scope of ORG which provide that exceptional leave to remain in or enter GPE must be given :", "\u201c ... where there is credible medical evidence that return , due to the medical facilities in the country concerned , would reduce the applicant \u2019s life expectancy and subject him to acute physical and mental suffering , in circumstances where the GPE [ GPE ] can be regarded as having assumed responsibility for his care . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG appealed against LAW CARDINAL finding , contending that all the Aids drugs available under ORG in GPE could also be obtained locally , and most were also available at a reduced price through the ORG Nations\u2019 funded projects and from bilateral Aids donor - funded programmes . The applicant \u2019s return would not , therefore , be to a \u201c complete absence of medical treatment \u201d , and so would not subject her to \u201c acute physical and mental suffering \u201d . ORG allowed the appeal on DATE . It found as follows :", "\u201c Medical treatment is available in GPE for the [ applicant \u2019s ] condition even though the ORG accept that the level of medical provision in GPE falls below that in GPE and will continue to lag behind the advance of continuing drug advances which inevitably first become available in highly developed countries . Nonetheless , extensive efforts are being made in GPE to tackle the Aids situation \u2013 Aids - treating drugs are available , refined forms of drug are being supplied ( albeit with time lags ) and it would not be until the [ applicant \u2019s ] specific and varying needs became known that her needs could be assessed and the then availability of appropriate treatment decided . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Leave to appeal to ORG was granted on DATE , and on DATE the applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG was dismissed by a majority of CARDINAL ( [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) . With reference to the case of NORP v. GPE ( cited above ) , Lord Justice Laws ( with whom Lord Justice PERSON concurred ) stated :", "\u201c The contrast between the relative well - being accorded in a signatory ORG to a very sick person who , for a while , even a long while , is accommodated there , and the scarcities and hardships which ( without any violation of international law ) he would face if he were returned home , is to my mind DATE even if the contrast is very great DATE an extremely fragile basis upon which to erect a legal duty upon the ORG to confer or extend a right to remain in its territory , a duty unsupported by any decision or policy adopted by the democratic arm , executive or legislature , of the ORG \u2019s government . The elaboration of immigration policy ... is a paradigm of the responsibility of elected government . CARDINAL readily understands that such a responsibility may be qualified by a supervening legal obligation arising under the ORG [ the Convention ] where the person in question claims to be protected from torture or other mistreatment in his home country in violation of the LAW , especially if it would be meted out to him at the hands of the ORG . But a claim to be protected from the harsh effects of a want of resources , albeit made harsher by its contrast with the facilities available in the host country , is to my mind something else altogether .", "... I would hold that the application of LAW where the complaint in essence is of want of resources in the applicant \u2019s home country ( in contrast to what has been available in the country from which he is to be removed ) is only justified where the humanitarian appeal of the case is so powerful that it could not in reason be resisted by the authorities of a civilised ORG . That does not , I acknowledge , amount to a sharp legal test ... an LAW case of this kind must be based on facts which are not only exceptional , but extreme ; extreme , that is , judged in the context of cases all or many of which ( like this one ) demand one \u2019s sympathy on pressing grounds ... \u201d", "Lord Justice Carnwath , dissenting , was unable to say that the facts of the case were so clear that the only reasonable conclusion was that LAW did not apply . Given the stark contrast between the applicant \u2019s position in GPE and the practical certainty of a dramatically reduced life expectancy if returned to GPE with no effective family support , he would have remitted the case to the fact - finding body in the case , ORG .", "CARDINAL . Leave to appeal to ORG was granted , and on CARDINAL DATE ORG unanimously dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal ( [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) .", "Lord PERSON of GPE summarised the applicant \u2019s prognosis as follows :", "\u201c ... In DATE [ the applicant ] developed a second Aids - defining illness , PERSON \u2019s sarcoma . The CDCARDINAL cell count of a normal healthy person is over CARDINAL . Hers was down to CARDINAL .", "As a result of modern drugs and skilled medical treatment over a lengthy period , including a prolonged course of systematic chemotherapy , the [ applicant ] is now much better . Her CDCARDINAL count has risen [ from CARDINAL ] to CARDINAL . Her condition is stable . Her doctors say that if she continues to have access to the drugs and medical facilities available in GPE she should remain well for \u2018 decades\u2019 . But without these drugs and facilities the prognosis is \u2018 appalling\u2019 : she will suffer ill health , discomfort , pain and death within DATE or CARDINAL . This is because the highly active antiretroviral medication she is currently receiving does not cure her disease . It does not restore her to her pre - disease state . The medication replicates the functions of her compromised immune system and protects her from the consequences of her immune deficiency while , and only while , she continues to receive it .", "The cruel reality is that if the [ applicant ] returns to GPE her ability to obtain the necessary medication is problematic . So if she returns to GPE and can not obtain the medical assistance she needs to keep her illness under control , her position will be similar to having a life - support machine turned off . \u201d", "Lord Hope of PERSON , with whom Lord PERSON , Lord PERSON of ORG - under - Heywood and Lord ORG agreed , referred in detail to the ORG \u2019s case - law ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , and held as follows :", "\u201c ... that GPE has adhered throughout to CARDINAL basic principles . On the one hand , the fundamental nature of the LAW guarantees applies irrespective of the reprehensible conduct of the applicant . ... On the other hand , aliens who are subject to expulsion can not claim any entitlement to remain in the territory of a ORG in order to continue to benefit from medical , social or other forms of assistance provided by the expelling ORG . For an exception to be made where expulsion is resisted on medical grounds the circumstances must be exceptional ... The question on which the ORG has to concentrate is whether the present state of the applicant \u2019s health is such that , on humanitarian grounds , he ought not to be expelled unless it can [ be ] shown that the medical and social facilities that he so obviously needs are actually available to him in the receiving ORG . The only cases where this test has been found to be satisfied are NORP v. GPE ... and PERSON v. GPE ... [ T]he ORG has been at pains in its decisions to avoid any further extension of the exceptional category of case which NORP v. GPE represents .", "It may be that the ORG has not really faced up to the consequences of developments in medical techniques since the cases of NORP v. the GPE and GPE v. GPE were decided . The position DATE is that HIV infections can be controlled effectively and indefinitely by the administration of retroviral drugs . In almost all cases where this treatment is being delivered successfully it will be found that at present the patient is in good health . But in almost all these cases stopping the treatment will lead in a very short time to a revival of all the symptoms from which the patient was originally suffering and to an early death . The antiretroviral treatment can be likened to a lifesupport machine . Although the effects of terminating the treatment are not so immediate , in the longer term they are just as fatal . It appears to be somewhat disingenuous for the ORG to concentrate on the applicant \u2019s state of health which , on a true analysis , is due entirely to the treatment whose continuation is so much at risk .", "But it can not be said that the ORG is unaware of the advances of medical science in this field . All the recent cases since GPE v. GPE have demonstrated this feature . The fact that the ORG appears to have been unmoved by them is due , I think , to its adherence to the principle that aliens who are subject to expulsion can not claim any entitlement to remain in the territory of a ORG in order to continue to benefit from medical , social or other forms of assistance provided by the expelling ORG . The way this principle was referred to and then applied in GPE the GPE ... is , in my opinion , highly significant . What the ORG is in effect saying it that the fact that the treatment may be beyond the reach of the applicant in the receiving ORG is not to be treated as an exceptional circumstance . It might be different if it could be said that it was not available there at all and that the applicant was exposed to an inevitable risk due to its complete absence . But that is increasingly unlikely to be the case in view of the amount of medical aid that is now reaching countries in ORG , especially those in sub - Saharan LOC . For the circumstances to be , as it was put in LOC v. the GPE , \u2018 very exceptional\u2019 it would need to be shown that the applicant \u2019s medical condition had reached such a critical stage that there were compelling humanitarian grounds for not removing him to a place which lacked the medical and social services which he would need to prevent acute suffering while he is dying .", "... So long as [ the applicant ] continues to take the treatment she will remain healthy and she will have DATE of good health to look forward to . Her present condition can not be said to be critical . She is fit to travel , and will remain fit if and so long as she can obtain the treatment that she needs when she returns to GPE . The evidence is that the treatment that she needs is available there , albeit at considerable cost . She also still has relatives there , although her position is that none of them would be willing and able to accommodate and take care of her . In my opinion her case falls into the same category as GPE v. GPE , PERSON v. the GPE , GPE v. GPE and GPE the GPE , where the ORG has consistently held that the test of exceptional circumstances has not been satisfied . In my opinion the ORG \u2019s jurisprudence leads inevitably to the conclusion that her removal to GPE would not violate the guarantees of LAW . ... \u201d", "Lord Hope concluded by observing :", "\u201c [ Any extension of the principles in NORP v. GPE ] would have the effect of affording all those in the [ applicant \u2019s ] condition a right of asylum in this country until such time as the standard of medical facilities available in their home countries for the treatment of HIV / Aids had reached that which is available in LOC . It would risk drawing into the GPE large numbers of people already suffering from HIV in the hope that they too could remain here indefinitely so that they could take the benefit of the medical resources that are available in this country . This would result in a very great and no doubt unquantifiable commitment of resources which it is , to say the least , highly questionable GPE Parties to the Convention would ever have agreed to . The better course , one might have thought , would be for GPE to continue to concentrate their efforts on the steps which are currently being taken , with the assistance of the drugs companies , to make the necessary medical care universally and freely available in the countries of the third world which are still suffering so much from the relentless scourge of HIV / Aids . \u201d", "ORG of GPE , agreeing that the appeal should be dismissed , reviewed the domestic and Convention authorities and phrased the test to be applied as follows :", "\u201c ... whether the applicant \u2019s illness has reached such a critical stage ( i.e. he is dying ) that it would be inhuman treatment to deprive him of the care which he is currently receiving and send him home to an early death unless there is care available there to enable him to meet that fate with dignity . ... [ The test ] is not met on the facts of this case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to information obtained by ORG of its own motion , HIV is normally treated by antiretroviral drugs . In GPE , in common with most developed countries , these drugs are provided in combination , a practice known as \u201c highly active antiretroviral therapy \u201d ( ORG ) . The proper administration of antiretroviral drugs depends on regular monitoring of the patient , including blood tests , and the availability of medical personnel to adjust at frequent intervals the level and type of drugs taken . Such treatment is generally available free of charge on ORG .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , attempts have been made to reduce the country \u2019s dependency on imported medication , including producing generic drugs locally . However , in common with most sub - NORP countries , the availability of antiretroviral drugs is hampered by limited financial resources and by shortcomings in the health - care infrastructure required to administer them effectively . As a result , according to research carried out by ORG ) , CARDINAL of those needing antiretroviral therapy in GPE receive it ( WHO , \u201c Progress on Global Access to HIV Antiretroviral Therapy \u201d , DATE , pp . CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ) . ORG Programme on HIV / Aids ( UNAIDS ) and WHO in their DATE country situation analysis on GPE also cited major barriers to HIV prevention , treatment , care and support as including limited public investment , limited service coverage and lack of a policy framework . There are also significant disparities in the provision of drugs between urban and rural areas ( WHO , \u201c ORG for HIV / Aids Treatment Scale - Up : GPE \u201d , DATE ) . In addition , progress in providing medical care has been offset by the ever - increasing number of people requiring treatment ( ORG , \u201c Aids Epidemic Update \u201d , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) and given the rapid population growth in GPE , its stable HIV incidence rate means that an increasing number of people acquire HIV DATE ( ORG , \u201c Aids Epidemic Update \u201d , DATE , p.
