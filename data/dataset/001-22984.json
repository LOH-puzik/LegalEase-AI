AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON and PERSON are NORP nationals , born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively , and live in GPE . They were represented before the Court by Mr A. Feichtner , a lawyer practising in PERSON ( GPE ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicants\u2019 father or husband , respectively , concluded a \u201c tenancy , option to purchase and mortgage agreement \u201d ( Miet- , Options- PERSON ) with the owner of an apartment in GPE ( GPE ) . According to this agreement its duration was to be DATE , the rent was CARDINAL NORP schilling per year and was considered as having already been paid as part of the contribution to the costs of construction . The tenancy contract automatically extended to future heirs . The owner would accept any successor named by the other party or its heirs as tenant . Furthermore , the owner granted him a right to pre - emption and an option to purchase the apartment to which he was bound for the duration of the contract . The price was fixed and in case of purchase would be set off against the contribution to the construction costs . Subsequently this agreement was entered in ORG ) .", "In DATE the ORG filed an action with ORG ( PERSON ) against the applicants , the heirs to their father or husband who had died in the meantime , requesting the court to declare void ( ORG der GPE ) the \u201c tenancy , option to purchase and mortgage agreement \u201d of DATE .", "On DATE ORG declared the agreement void . It found that the intention of the parties when concluding the contract of DATE had been to transfer a status tantamount to that of an owner on the applicants\u2019 father , as was apparent from the conditions set out in the contract although it had the form of a tenancy agreement . In view of the number of foreign land owners in GPE , the real property transaction authorities would not have given their consent to a sales contract . The contract of DATE was therefore a sham and had to be declared void under LAW , which provides that a contract concluded in violation of a prohibition established by law is void .", "Upon the ORG appeal , on DATE , ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) confirmed ORG judgment . On DATE the applicants filed a further appeal on points of law ( Revision ) with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) in which they argued that the power of ORG to request the courts to declare void contracts which had been concluded DATE violated their rights under LAW No . CARDINAL as the declaration by ORG constituted a disproportionate interference with a legal position they had enjoyed over DATE . Furthermore , they argued that the DATE amendment to LAW had not been properly published and was therefore unconstitutional .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG further appeal . It found that the DATE amendment had been properly published and that there was no reason for applying to ORG Verfassungsgerichtshof ) for a review of the constitutionality of that amendment . It also had no doubts about the constitutionality of Section CARDINALa of the Real Property Transactions Act as nobody could expect that a status acquired by an unlawful act could become one protected by the law in the future . The fact that ORG could file actions against sham contracts which had been concluded DATE did not interfere with acquired rights ( wohlerworbenen Rechten ) , the only limit being prescription after DATE .", "On DATE , after ORG had given its above decision , another chamber of that court decided that the right of ORG to request a declaratory decision applied only to transactions that were effected after DATE . If this right extended to previous transactions , that provision would be unconstitutional . On DATE ORG declared unconstitutional the DATE amendment to LAW , which established ORG powers , because it considered that this amendment had not been published as required by the relevant law .", "Under the Tyrol LAW DATE ( PERSON ) , a contract concerning the transfer of ownership over real property was subject to approval by ORG if agricultural and forestry land was concerned or if the purchaser did not possess NORP nationality ( Section CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . Such a contract could only take effect if it was approved by the real property transaction authorities ( Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . The purchaser of land was obliged to seek approval of the contract within DATE ( LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . If approval was withheld , the acquisition was null and void ( LAW ) . The conclusion of a tenancy did not require such consent , neither did an acquisition under a will .", "According to an amendment to LAW of DATE , ORG . DATE , which entered into force on DATE , tenancy agreements concluded with a foreigner could only be entered in ORG after ORG had given its consent .", "A further amendment to LAW of DATE enabled ORG to request a court decision declaring void a contract which constituted a circumvention of the requirement of consent under LAW ( Section CARDINALa ) . This right of ORG also related to transactions which had been concluded before that amendment entered into force ( LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
