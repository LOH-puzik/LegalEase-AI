The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She is a psychiatrist and has been registered since DATE as a psychological expert for court proceedings in custody and contact - rights - related disputes and decisions on public care as well as child abuse . Specialised in the psychological examination of children and adolescents , her focus is mainly on custody and contact - rights - related disputes .", "CARDINAL . The online publication \u201c meinbezirk.at \u201d was published and edited by the \u201c Print \u201d ORG , a private company which had its registered office in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The regional DATE print publication PERSON , which was sent to every household of the district free , was published and edited by the \u201c Print \u201d PERSON , a private company which had its registered office in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an article was published in \u201c meinbezirk.at \u201d as well as in the print version of PERSON , which stated as follows :", "\u201c The quality of experts in the spotlight ( ORG i m Visier )", "Disclosed : Court Expert for custody proceedings a case for therapy", "( Aufgedeckt : ORG Sachverst\u00e4ndige selbst ein Therapie - Fall )", "Suffering from up - and - down mood swings , panic attacks , suicidal thoughts and hallucinations , together with paranoid ideas \u2013 but working as a court - appointed expert . In DATE she has examined over CARDINAL married couples in custodyrelated disputes . Now it seems , it gets rough for [ the applicant ] as an expert report about her psychological condition has been disclosed ...", "A psychological expert report by Dr. PERSON was commissioned in DATE in the course of civil proceedings ( action because of an alleged breach of promise of marriage ) which unearthed the deficiencies of [ the applicant ] described above . Moreover , Dr. PERSON came to the conclusion that the applicant \u2019s impairments were hereditary , as the history of her family showed an accumulation of these impairments . DATE , the applicant was introduced to the \u201c expert community \u201d at ORG , and her integrity was beyond reproach for DATE until now . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The passage was followed by comments by a member of ORG , who had made a criminal complaint against the applicant with ORG office , ORG at ORG of GPE , and the Vice - President of ORG , who was responsible for managing the list of experts at the court . At the end of the article it was mentioned that the applicant was no longer answering her phone and had withdrawn from all her cases .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the article the applicant was confronted with questions related to it from colleagues and patients , and proceedings were initiated at ORG to clarify whether she was still fit to work as a court - appointed expert . In the course of those proceedings the applicant \u2019s mental status was also set to be examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an action with the St. ORG . She sought damages under section CARDINAL of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) and the publication of the judgment claiming that the article and in particular the passages dealing with the psychological expert report on the applicant had violated her intimate personal sphere and compromised her publicly . However , she did not argue that the expert report had been obtained unlawfully .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( FAC P\u00f6lten ) allowed the applicant \u2019s action , ordered the publisher to pay damages in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) and the operative part of the judgment to be published . Furthermore , the publisher was to bear the costs of the proceedings . The court found that an average reader would understand the article as putting the expert opinion from DATE in direct relation to the applicant \u2019s work as an expert now , thus questioning the quality of her work . The article , that also featured the applicant \u2019s full name and the description of her psychological impairment , touched her intimate personal sphere , since it created a link between her mental state and the quality of her work . However , the information itself did not allow for such a link , especially since the expert opinion dated from DATE and dealt only with a very specific question in the context of civil proceedings at the time . The incomplete and manipulative content of the article was not able to meet the standards of reporting on matters of fact . Furthermore , the court did not consider that there was a direct link between the contents of the article and the applicant \u2019s public position , given that she mainly worked as an expert in custody cases , which were not usually heard in public . Furthermore , it could be assumed that the applicant , a psychiatrist herself and a medical doctor , was managing her illness well and was able to do her work without any impairments .", "CARDINAL . The publisher appealed on points of law and fact , as well as against the sentence ( GPE wegen GPE , PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Thereupon , on DATE , ORG ( Oberlandesgericht Wien ) heard the appeal , set aside the judgment of the lower court , and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . ORG confirmed that the article and the impugned passages giving opinions on the applicant \u2019s mental state affected her intimate personal sphere and were capable of compromising her . However , the content of the article was true , as it only repeated true information that had not been disputed by the applicant . Furthermore , the court did not find the article to be incomplete or manipulative , but sufficiently well - balanced and faithful to the different sides of the story in that it also referred to the fact that the applicant \u2019s integrity had never been questioned in DATE ; the court also asked for statements from the Vice - President of ORG , a member of ORG , and ORG of ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further found that the publication in issue was directly linked to the applicant \u2019s public status . She had been included in the list of experts to be appointed by the courts since DATE and had been appointed in several cases . This regular work as an expert in court proceedings belongs beyond doubt to the public sphere ( \u201c ... ist zweifellos dem \u00f6ffentlichen PERSON zuzuordnen ... \u201d ) as she took part in association with the ORG - organised judiciary and held an important position in connection with the decision - making process of judges . Even though the impugned expert opinion dated from DATE and concerned a period in the applicant \u2019s life prior even to that date , the reporting in question touched sufficiently upon the present public activities of the applicant . Considering the importance and sensitivity of the area of custody proceedings and the dominant role of experts in the field , the psychological integrity of an expert assigned to those cases had to be beyond doubt . Any reservation in relation to the mental health of experts \u2013 if based on sufficient reasons \u2013 had to be met with a thorough investigation in the interest of good conduct of the administration of justice , which was what had happened as the next step in the present case . According to ORG , the article took up doubts arising from the neurologist opinion in DATE without denying the applicant \u2019s abilities as an expert in the area . The truthful information in the article and the public interest in the subject matter justified the article \u2019s critical questioning of exactly those abilities .", "CARDINAL . That judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s representative on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime the applicant lodged an action with ORG on DATE . She sought damages under section CARDINAL of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) and publication of the judgment claiming that the article , and in particular the passages dealing with the psychological expert report on her , violated her intimate personal sphere and compromised her publicly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Innsbruck ORG ( Landesgericht Innsbruck ) granted the applicant \u2019s action , ordered the publisher to pay damages in the amount of CARDINAL ( ORG ) and the publication of the operative part of the judgment . Furthermore , costs were awarded against the publisher . The court found that the average reader would understand the article as stating that the applicant was incapable of being an expert in custody proceedings because of her own mental health impairments in DATE and that this placed in question the quality of the applicant \u2019s work so far . That the applicant \u2019s psychological illness was directly linked to the intimate personal sphere was beyond doubt . The present article not only mentioned the applicant \u2019s mental health status , but also grossly exaggerated individual symptoms , which was also capable of compromising her . The article was so incomplete and distorted that it could not be considered a report of matters of fact . ORG in particular noted that the article did not mention that the period of examination was even DATE and that only certain aspects of the expert opinion had been published , while others had not . Scandalously the article created the impression that the applicant had rendered decisive opinions in custody proceedings for DATE while herself suffering from the symptoms described above . Furthermore , the publication was not linked in any way to the applicant \u2019s public status ( \u201c ... steht [ ... ] in keinem unmittelbaren PERSON \u00f6ffentlichen LOC ) . There was no connection between the applicant \u2019s work at present and her mental health status DATE . Her work in the context of custody proceedings was also not conducted in public .", "CARDINAL . The publisher appealed on points of law and fact , as well as against the sentence ( GPE wegen GPE , PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Thereupon , on DATE , ORG ( GPE ) granted the appeal , set aside the judgment of the lower court , and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . In contrast to ORG it found that the average reader would understand from the article at issue that in DATE an expert opinion was rendered in respect of the applicant that showed the above - mentioned psychological impairments . However , the article also stated that the applicant \u2019s integrity had not been questioned for DATE . The article , while focusing on the applicant \u2019s work in custody proceedings , gave space to comments from ORG of ORG of GPE , a member of ORG , and the Vice - President of ORG . The article did not indicate however that the applicant was not competent to exercise her profession as a psychological expert . Furthermore , the published information was true . The fact that only parts of the expert opinion were repeated in the article did not render the article distortive , nor the relevant information untrue .", "CARDINAL . As regards the connection to the public sphere and public interest , ORG found that the ORG administration , together with the administration of justice , belonged to the public sphere . The applicant had been included in the list of court - commissioned experts since DATE , and her repeated work as an expert in court proceedings must be considered as belonging to the public sphere . The activity was closely linked to the administration of justice , and had a considerable influence on judges\u2019 decision - making processes . The impugned article concerned the applicant \u2019s activity as an expert in custody proceedings . Considering the importance and sensitivity of the area of custody proceedings and the dominant role of experts in the field , the psychological integrity of an expert assigned to those cases had to be beyond doubt . Any reservation in relation to the mental health of experts \u2013 if based on sufficient reasons \u2013 had to be met with a thorough investigation in the interest of the proper administration of justice , which had happened as a next step in the present case . Insofar , a truthful report linked to a person \u2019s public status , which also contained information belonging to the intimate personal sphere must be permitted to be published . ORG concluded that the article , by way of an appropriate commentary , critically examined a matter of public interest and therefore exercised its role as a \u201c public watchdog \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
