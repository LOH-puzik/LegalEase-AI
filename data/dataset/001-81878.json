He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE , the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody ( inverzekeringstelling ) on suspicion of having committed rape , attempted manslaughter and/or intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm in that he \u2013 having twisted the victim \u2019s arm behind the latter \u2019s back and constrained the victim \u2013 had forcibly inserted a wooden ladle in the victim \u2019s anus , resulting in a perforation of the colon . At the material time and for DATE , the victim , the applicant and the latter \u2019s wife had been engaged in a longstanding tripartite relationship .", "On DATE , after having heard the applicant , the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) ordered the applicant \u2019s detention on remand ( inbewaringstelling ) for a period of DATE . The reasons stated by the investigating judge were :", "\u201c It appears from the case - file that there are serious indications against the suspect ( there is more than a mere suspicion ) .", "There are weighty reasons of public safety that warrant detention on remand , namely :", "detention on remand is necessary because it concerns an act which , according to the legal definition , attracts a prison sentence of DATE or more whereas in addition this act has seriously rocked the legal order ( the act is of an extraordinarily grave nature ) ; \u201d", "On DATE , after having heard the applicant , ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) ordered the applicant \u2019s further detention on remand ( gevangenhouding ) for DATE , holding :", "\u201c ORG considers that , after examination , it has appeared that the suspicion , indications and ground , which have led to the order for detention on remand ( bevel tot bewaring ) , currently still exist . \u201d", "The applicant filed an appeal against the decision of DATE with the \u2018 s - ORG ( gerechtshof ) . The applicant did not challenge the existence of serious indications against him but argued that , given the context in which the facts had occurred , his release would not give rise to any social unrest which would justify keeping him in pre - trial detention . In his opinion , nobody would be shocked if he was released from pre - trial detention , as little publicity had been given to the criminal investigation and his arrest . The public prosecutor argued that the release of a suspect of rape always caused upheaval in society and certainly in this case where the victim had suffered considerable harm . The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed on DATE by the \u2018 s - ORG ( gerechtshof ) . It held that the argument raised by the applicant failed to appreciate that his release could get wider publicity in the suspect \u2019s surroundings , thus rocking the legal order .", "In the meantime CARDINAL further prolongations DATE each \u2013 of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand were ordered by ORG on DATE and DATE , respectively .

On the basis of reports drawn up by a psychiatrist and a psychologist who had examined the applicant , ORG found that the applicant was suffering from an Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , an alcohol addiction and an anti - social personality disorder and concluded that , at the time of the commission of the offence , the applicant was able to understand the unlawful nature of his acts but that his mental faculties were so poorly developed that he could only be held responsible for these offences to a limited degree . In this light , ORG decided to sentence the applicant to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , of which DATE were suspended pending a CARDINAL years\u2019 probation period , less the time spent in pre - trial detention . In addition , it imposed a special condition ( bijzondere voorwaarde ) within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) to the effect that the applicant was to comply \u2013 during DATE with directives given to him by the local section of the GPE probation and social rehabilitation service ( reclassering ) , also if this would entail treatment for substance abuse .
