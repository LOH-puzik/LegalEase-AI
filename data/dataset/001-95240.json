He was represented before the ORG by Mr. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A prior application by the applicant ( no . CARDINAL ) concerned the length of the same proceedings which are at issue here and was disposed of by judgment of DATE .", "The facts of the present case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE CARDINAL masked and armed man entered the house of NORP in GPE , a town close to GPE . When PERSON , who owned a roofing business , and his wife returned home , they were threatened and beaten by the men , and forced to open their safe from which the CARDINAL men stole money , stocks and jewellery worth around MONEY ( ORG ) .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested in PERSON . On DATE the ORG issued a warrant of arrest against the applicant on the ground that there was a strong suspicion that he had committed CARDINAL offences of robbery , inter alia the robbery of PERSON , and CARDINAL count of robbery in connection with attempted murder .", "On DATE ORG charged the applicant with attempted murder , aggravated robbery causing physical injury , and an offence under LAW .", "On DATE ORG accepted the indictment without modifications and decided to open the main proceedings against the applicant and CARDINAL other accused .", "On DATE a police informant ( Vertrauensperson ) was questioned by police officer PERSON in connection with the ORG robbery .", "The informant reported that in DATE , DATE after the robbery , he / she had heard in the \u201c milieu \u201d for the first time that an elderly couple in ORG had been robbed . According to his / her information the robbery had been committed by an \u201c Emin \u201d and a \u201c PERSON . Allegedly they had first broken in and entered the house of the elderly couple . Then , the man had appeared and was overpowered . Shortly afterwards the wife had entered the house and was overpowered as well . The couple was tied up and forced to reveal the hiding place of the safe from which around DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL or CARDINAL were taken . A certain \u201c Djoni \u201d who had given the tip for the robbery in ORG had received some of the goods . As far as the informant remembered , each of the CARDINAL had got CARDINAL . \u201c FAC and \u201c PERSON \u201d had opened a bistro in PERSON with this money . \u201c PERSON had allegedly wasted much of the money . The informant further stated that he / she had also been told that shortly after the robbery the daughter of the robbed couple had appeared . DATE of the robbery had been her birthday . Details of the robbery were not known to the informant . He / she had heard though that the men had stubbed out burning cigarettes on the bodies of their victims .", "The informant had further reported that \u201c Emin \u201d and \u201c Zvonko \u201d were first names and that \u201c Emin \u201d was from GPE and \u201c GPE \u201d from GPE . The last name of \u201c GPE \u201d was not known to the informant , \u201c PERSON \u2019s \u201d last name was PERSON , according to the informant . When he / she had been shown photos in DATE by his / her supervisor he / she had recognised both men . During questioning in DATE the informant was again confronted with the same pictures and again recognised the CARDINAL men .", "The informant \u2019s supervisor , who was also questioned by police officer PERSON on DATE and who also remained anonymous , stated that he knew the identity of the informant and had worked with the person for DATE . In DATE the informant had told him about the robbery in ORG in DATE The supervisor further observed that what the informant had said when questioned by PERSON was essentially the same as the informant had told him in DATE .", "The first trial started on DATE . However , the proceedings had to be abandoned later on because CARDINAL lay judges fell ill ; the trial was then reopened on DATE .", "The applicant , who was represented by counsel during the trial , denied the charges and alleged that he had been in LOC , Former GPE , at the time of the robbery of L.", "During the first trial , on DATE , the defence challenged the calling of police officer PERSON as a witness , arguing that they did not know the identity of the informant and whether the guarantee of confidentiality was according to the law . If the informant \u2019s statements were introduced into the trial by way of hearing police officer PERSON as a hearsay witness the defence could not test the informant \u2019s credibility .", "On DATE ORG for the Interior of ORG made a declaration refusing to reveal the informant \u2019s identity ( PERSON ) . The Ministry argued , inter alia , that the informant had been guaranteed confidentiality and that it was necessary to keep his / her identity secret in order to protect his / her life and limb , especially in view of the brutality of the crimes the accused were charged with .", "On CARDINAL and DATE ORG , relying on the reasons given in the declaration of DATE , submitted CARDINAL more declarations refusing to reveal the identity of further informants and the informant \u2019s supervisor .", "During the second trial ORG heard , inter alia , police officer PERSON as a witness regarding the statements made by the informant and the informant \u2019s supervisor ( see above , CARDINAL . ORG - trial investigations ) , CARDINAL former cellmates of the applicant who claimed that the applicant had confessed to involvement in the robbery in ORG to them , and also heard CARDINAL counter - witnesses put forward by the defence .", "On DATE the applicant and his counsel lodged a request to take evidence by legal inspection through CARDINAL of the judges of the court ( richterliche Inaugenscheinnahme ) to make sure that the informant existed . The applicant reasoned that the proceedings so far , as well as the exclusion of questions of the defence with a view to verifying the reliability of the informant , had led to the impression that this person was an invention of the police in order to cover up the identity of the real informant . Since questions regarding the knowledge of the informant had so far been refused , this exclusion violated the principle of fair trial . The applicant further requested :", "\u201c Questioning of the informant directly by video", "+ multiple written questioning", "+ person is an invention of the police ! \u201d", "By decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request as inadmissible . It argued that a legal inspection was inadmissible . Direct questioning of the informant would be in conflict with ORG refusal to reveal the informant \u2019s identity . Irrespective of whether an optical and/or acoustic screening was admissible under NORP law , such questioning would run counter to the applicant \u2019s request because the existence of the informant would not thereby be disclosed . The court further reasoned that the informant had already been questioned ; the result had been introduced by hearing police officer PERSON as a witness . Regarding the allegation that the informant was \u201c an invention of the police \u201d ORG found that this was a conclusion of the applicant , who moreover had not given evidence for it .", "On DATE the ORG pronounced its judgment . It found the applicant guilty of the robbery of L. and his wife in ORG , convicted him of serious robbery and serious bodily harm and acquitted him of attempted murder ( regarding a different robbery ) and imposed a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant \u2019s co - accused were , inter alia , found guilty of attempted murder .", "In its long and detailed decision ORG based its conviction that the applicant had participated in the robbery on the statement of the informant , introduced through the testimony of police officer PERSON and corroborated by further evidence , as well as on the statements of the CARDINAL former cellmates of the applicant .", "ORG noted that the first lead concerning the applicant \u2019s involvement in the ORG robbery had come from confidential information received by the police , verification of which had reinforced the suspicion towards the applicant and his co - accused .", "Witness E. , a police officer from the ORG police department , reported in this context that in DATE an informant had provided another police officer , whose identity was confidential , with a lead regarding the robbery of a roofer and the involvement of CARDINAL PERSON named \u201c PERSON \u201d and \u201c GPE \u201d as well as someone named \u201c Jonni \u201d who had provided the tip for the crime . Witness PERSON had neither met the informant nor knew his name .", "Witness PERSON , the police officer who had questioned the informant , testified that in DATE there had been a lead that the mentioned \u201c Jonni \u201d had opened a restaurant on LOC or NORP coast . Further investigations had led to ORG in PERSON ( a town on LOC ) owned by a GPE . Then , in DATE , an informant had revealed that an \u201c Emin \u201d was staying with a NORP in PERSON and had had a child with her , born in DATE . According to this information \u201c Emin \u201d was an NORP and was considered to be the perpetrator of several robberies in ORG and GPE together with a \u201c PERSON . DATE these CARDINAL had , according to this information , robbed a couple who owned a roofing business close to GPE . A survey of all registered NORP women in PERSON had led to a woman who had named a Dzevdet Dzelili as the father of her child born in DATE . The police had subsequently photographed persons entering and leaving the apartment of the woman and shown these photographs to the informant , who had recognised both men he / she had mentioned , \u201c GPE \u201d and \u201c Emin \u201d , in these pictures . The persons where later identified as PERSON and PERSON alias PERSON .", "ORG observed in the reasoning of its judgment that the above outlined confidential information as well as the information received from the informant , as recalled during the trial by witness PERSON as interviewing officer , had proven to be correct in its essential points . Most of the information regarding the circumstances of the offence had been confirmed by the victims , Mr. and Mrs. PERSON , who had been heard as witnesses at the trial . CARDINAL parts of the informant \u2019s statement had proven to be incorrect , namely the purported mistreatment of the victims with burning cigarettes and that the day of the offence had been the birthday of the ORG daughter . However , DATE of the offence was the birthday of the ORG grandson and the ORG daughter had indeed arrived shortly after the robbery together with her husband and the grandson . ORG therefore found the statement regarding the daughter \u2019s birthday to be a simple mistake , not only an accidental parallel . Furthermore , the informant \u2019s statement regarding the takeover of a restaurant in PERSON , namely ORG , and the applicant \u2019s involvement in this business together with the named \u201c Djoni \u201d or \u201c LOC as well as the statement as to the stolen goods , had been confirmed by depositions of several witnesses . In this respect ORG also noted that the DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL to CARDINAL stolen in the ORG robbery provided an answer to the question as to how the applicant in DATE could afford to invest DEM MONEY in a restaurant , a fact that had been established by witness testimony .", "ORG further based its conviction on the testimony of CARDINAL former cellmates , according to whom the applicant had confessed to involvement in the robbery at issue . Given that CARDINAL of the witnesses had not repeated his pre - trial statement to that effect in court but rather stated that he was not able to recall details , the police officer who had questioned him was heard as a hearsay witness . While the court expressed doubts as to the reliability ( PERSON ) of the CARDINAL witnesses in general , it was convinced that with regard to the applicant \u2019s confession the statements were credible ( glaubhaft ) , in particular because they were consistent with one another and contained personal details which could only have been passed on by the applicant himself and not , as alleged by the defence , been taken from the reasoning of the arrest warrant .", "Upon request of the defence the court had also heard CARDINAL prison inmates as witnesses who knew the CARDINAL former cellmates of the applicant and , with CARDINAL exception , stated that these CARDINAL had intentionally made false statements regarding an alleged confession to obtain advantages for their own trials .", "As to the applicant \u2019s alleged alibi , ORG heard witnesses and came to the conclusion that it did not preclude the applicant \u2019s involvement in the crime because it was not continuous . Further witnesses from the Former GPE named by the applicant were summoned but informed the court that they would not appear .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against ORG judgment .", "The applicant alleged a violation of ORG duty to clarify the relevant facts ( PERSON ) as well as a violation of the applicant \u2019s right to question witnesses ( PERSON ) . The applicant submitted that ORG should have requested a review of ORG \u2019s declaration refusing to reveal the informant \u2019s identity of CARDINAL DATE in view of , inter alia , the time elapsed and the possibility of questioning by video link with acoustic and optical shielding . Also , in view of the applicant \u2019s request of DATE , which should have been taken as a suggestion to take evidence ( PERSON ) , the ORG should have considered other possibilities of enabling the defence to question the informant . Because it was ORG duty to counterbalance the handicaps resulting from maintaining the anonymity of the informant ORG should furthermore not have dismissed the request for \u201c multiple written questioning \u201d . The applicant also submitted that ORG had based his conviction to a decisive extent on the statements of an anonymous witness he had not been able to question , without documenting that it had treated these statements with adequate care .", "On DATE ORG , following an oral hearing , confirmed the judgment of ORG regarding the verdict ( Schuldspruch ) . In respect of the sentence ( PERSON ) the judgment was quashed and the case remitted to ORG for renewed sentencing .", "ORG noted that ORG had not had any reason to re - examine the ORG \u2019s declaration refusing to reveal the informant \u2019s identity . In particular the newly created possibility of questioning the informant by video link according to LAW did not give rise to a request for reconsideration by the court ; it could not dispel security concerns since anonymity would not be preserved . Acoustic and optical shielding during questioning by video link had at that time not been deemed admissible under domestic law . Furthermore , acoustic and optical shielding would not have been sufficient in the instant case , because the questions of the defence would have been targeted at the source of the informant \u2019s knowledge and his / her relationship to the accused and would have thereby endangered the informant \u2019s anonymity . According to LAW such questions , while limited to the \u201c necessary \u201d , can not be completely excluded . Therefore , ORG could not and did not have to expect ORG to consent to such a procedure .", "Regarding an alleged violation of the applicant \u2019s right to question witnesses according to CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( d ) of ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law as inadmissible because the applicant had only requested \u201c multiple written questioning \u201d of the informant during the trial but had not submitted the intended questions with his request of DATE . Hence , it was impossible for ORG to examine whether ORG had in fact violated the applicant \u2019s right to question a witness . Because the request of DATE was unsubstantiated ORG did not have to grant it .", "ORG further noted that ORG had , as required by its case - law regarding the so called \u201c corrective of the cautious assessment of evidence \u201d ( GPE der vorsichtigen PERSON ) , taken a cautious approach when assessing the statement of the anonymous witness , which was also corroborated by other evidence . Moreover , the statements of the applicant \u2019s former cellmates constituted evidence entirely independent from the informant \u2019s statement .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG .", "Before ORG the applicant argued that his right under LAW ( d ) of the LAW to question or have questioned witnesses of the prosecution had been violated . He submitted in particular that his conviction had been based to a decisive extent on the statements of the anonymous witness , who had not been heard in open court and who he or his counsel had had no opportunity to question .", "In view of the case - law of the ORG and the then novel possibility in national law to question witnesses by video link , the applicant argued that ORG would have at least had to put the question of a video link , possibly with acoustic and optical shielding , to ORG and ask whether it still upheld its declaration of DATE . While acoustic and optical shielding was at the time of the judgment of ORG not approved by ORG , the applicant submitted that its relevant decision dated from before the change in the law regarding questioning by video link . Since acoustic and optical shielding therefore no longer conflicted with domestic procedural law it should have been considered by ORG .", "With regard to the judgment of ORG the applicant complained that it had not examined his submissions concerning possible questioning by video link under his right to question witnesses but only with regard to ORG duty to clarify the relevant facts . He further submitted that ORG was incorrect in requiring him to disclose specific questions he wanted to put to the informant .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for examination . It found that in view of the ORG \u2019s case - law , in particular PERSON and Others v. GPE , the applicant \u2019s right to a fair trial had not been violated .", "In view of the inclination towards violence of the group of perpetrators and the resulting threat to the informant ORG found it acceptable that the lower courts had not requested ORG to reconsider its almost DATE declaration refusing to reveal the informant \u2019s identity , since a revocation of the declaration could not be expected . For these reasons the lower courts could also predict that ORG would not consent to questioning by shielded video link .", "Regarding the alleged violation of the applicant \u2019s right to question witnesses ORG found the submission of the applicant to be insufficiently substantiated . Since ORG had in this respect dismissed the appeal on points of law as inadmissible the constitutional complaint had to meet special demands regarding its substantiation . In contrast , the applicant \u2019s arguments against the decision of ORG were based solely on sub - constitutional law and hence his constitutional complaint was inadequately reasoned in the eyes of ORG .", "Article CARDINAL . [ Examination as to ORG and Personal Details ]", "...", "( CARDINAL ) If there is reason to fear that revealing the identity or the place of residence or whereabouts of the witness would endanger the ORG or another person \u2019s life , limb or liberty , the witness may be permitted not to give personal details or to give details only in respect of an earlier identity . However , if so asked at the main hearing , he shall be required to state in what capacity the facts he is indicating became known to him . ...", "( CARDINAL ) Where necessary , questions relating to circumstances justifying the NORP credibility in the case at hand , particularly concerning his relationship with the accused or the aggrieved party , shall be submitted to him .", "Article CARDINAL . [ Taking of Evidence ]", "...", "( CARDINAL ) In order to establish the truth , the court shall , ex officio , extend the taking of evidence to all facts and means of proof relevant to the decision .", "( CARDINAL ) An application to take evidence shall be rejected if the taking of such evidence is inadmissible . In all other cases , an application to take evidence may be rejected only if the taking of such evidence is superfluous because the matter is common knowledge , if the fact to be proved is irrelevant to the decision or has already been proved , if the evidence is wholly inappropriate or unobtainable , if an application is made to prolong the proceedings , or if an important allegation which is intended to offer proof in exoneration of the defendant can be treated as if the alleged fact were true .", "...", "Article PERSON . [ Witness Examination in Another Place ]", "If there is an imminent risk of serious detriment to the well - being of the witness were he to be examined in the presence of those attending the main hearing and if that risk can not be averted in some other way , namely by removing the defendant and excluding the public , the court may order that the witness remain in another place during the examination ; ... The decision shall be incontestable . A simultaneous video transmission of the testimony shall be provided in the courtroom . The testimony shall be recorded if there are grounds to fear that it will not be possible to examine the witness at a future main hearing and if the recording is necessary to establish the truth . ...", "For a request for evidence to be taken to be admissible it must necessarily identify a particular matter to be proven ( GPE ) , the aim of the application ( PERSON ) and the evidence ( ORG ) . If an application is not sufficiently substantiated in this regard it can still be a suggestion to take evidence ( PERSON ) or a request for evidence determination ( Beweisermittlungsantrag ) which the court must then consider under its duty to clarify the relevant facts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
