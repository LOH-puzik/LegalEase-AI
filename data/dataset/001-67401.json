The region \u2019s inhabitants use the groundwater ; in the event of seepage , it could become polluted by toxic waste . Cyanide has a high pH value , which is influenced by rainfall : when the pH level falls , the cyanide may transform into hydrogen cyanide ( HCN ) .

Consequently , it is possible that waste material containing cyanide , after pumping to the retaining dams , could seep into and pollute water sources and other sites [ where water is used ] ... The region \u2019s flora and fauna are also threatened . [ Accordingly ] , it must be borne in mind that cyanide use poses a considerable risk to human health and the environment ...", "In the light of the technical and legal conclusions and bearing in mind the ORG \u2019s obligation to protect the right to life [ and ] to a healthy environment ... , it is appropriate to overturn the judgment appealed against , given that the gold mine \u2019s disputed operational methods entail the risks set out in the environmental impact report and the expert reports and that , should those risks be realised , human health would be clearly affected , directly or indirectly , through environmental damage ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
