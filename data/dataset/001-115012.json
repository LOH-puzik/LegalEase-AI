The first and second applicants , who are sister and brother , were born in GPE in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants arrived in GPE with their mother and were in view of the children \u2019s particular situation granted a residence permit on DATE on the ground of strong humanitarian considerations ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the former DATE LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . During DATE the mother returned with the children to GPE , where the children first lived with their grandparents and then with their father and his wife . There they stayed until DATE , when the mother resettled in GPE with the children . In the meantime , on DATE ORG had granted them a settlement permit , while being ignorant about their stay in GPE from DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants\u2019 father applied for family reunification . His application , which was refused , prompted an investigation by the immigration authorities which revealed that for most of the period from DATE to DATE the applicants and their mother had lived in GPE . The authorities further observed that the applicants had strong attachment to GPE since they had lived and gone to school in that country from DATE to DATE and because their father still lived there . On DATE ORG decided to withdraw the ORG and their ORG settlement permit , on the ground that the permit had been granted on the basis of false information provided by the mother about her and the children \u2019s residence in GPE . It was also decided to refuse them further residence in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the ORG \u2019s decision . Several successive requests for reconsideration were rejected . In DATE the children were apprehended with a view to being deported to GPE . However , the police decided not to do so , based on their information that they had no contact with the mother or with the family in GPE . The police considered that it would be inappropriate to expel them without their mother who had disappeared around the turn of the year DATE . The applicants had no contacts with their mother until she was hospitalised in GPE in DATE . During this period they lived with an uncle and aunt in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant was convicted for unprovoked aggravated physical assault , having hit another person with his fist causing a fracture to the victim \u2019s nose and a QUANTITY scar on his eyelid that had to be stitched . For this and certain other offences ( withdrawal of CARDINAL NORP Krone ( ORG ) from cash points by using another person \u2019s credit card ; driving a stolen moped and the possession of QUANTITY of hashish ) he was sentenced to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In the light of these offences , ORG decided on DATE to expel him indefinitely , with reference to section CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW , as he had been convicted for an offence that was punishable by CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants sought to challenge the validity of the decision of DATE and , as regards the second applicant , that of CARDINAL DATE . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld their action .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the mother was expelled to GPE , in compliance with the immigration authorities\u2019 decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . She died in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found against the applicants . It was observed that when the settlement permit was revoked in DATE , the applicants had in reality resided unlawfully in GPE for DATE . At that time they had close relatives in GPE , including their father , with whom they had lived for periods DATE before . Nor did ORG find that the decision of CARDINAL DATE regarding the second applicant was disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a previous application ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) under the Convention , complaining that their deportation to GPE would constitute a violation of NORP CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . They also requested an interim measure to stay their deportation under Rule CARDINAL of ORG . On DATE the request was refused . The applicants did not pursue their application . On DATE , a ORG of CARDINAL judges decided to strike it out of the ORG \u2019s list of cases ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE ORG , in CARDINAL separate decisions , rejected the ORG requests for modification of the decision of CARDINAL DATE revoking their settlement ( and residence ) permit and , as regards the second applicant , the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE to expel him indefinitely from GPE . ORG observed that such modification was not warranted either by strong humanitarian considerations or a strong attachment to GPE ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the former DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the first applicant the ORG had regard to the fact that she had not had a residence permit since DATE and that any links established after this date ought to carry little weight . Furthermore , all of the first applicant \u2019s closest family lived in GPE and her brother , the second applicant , had been ordered to leave GPE indefinitely .", "CARDINAL . As regards the second applicant the ORG quoted from its decision of CARDINAL DATE and maintained its previous view :", "\u201c As to the [ second applicant \u2019s ] attachment to GPE , the ORG has attached particular weight to the fact that during the period from DATE , when he had a residence permit in GPE , he had essentially lived in GPE . By ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE his settlement permit was finally revoked . He does not have a residence permit and is obliged to leave the country . In practice , links that are established during unlawful residence carry little weight . Reference is also made to the fact that [ the second applicant \u2019s ] mother and sister do not hold a residence permit and are obliged to leave the country . In addition , the applicant has close family in his home country . He therefore ought to be seen as having relatively strong attachment to his home country .", "The ORG can not see that the [ second applicant \u2019s ] current situation has been significantly changed since the situation considered in the decision of CARDINAL DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of both applicants ORG also referred to the reasoning and conclusions in earlier decisions and judgments and emphasised that its conclusions in the present decisions ought to be viewed in the context of those .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants challenged that decision before the courts . In this connection they both requested an interlocutory injunction to stop their deportation . These requests were rejected by ORG on DATE and ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG quashed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , disagreeing with the ORG \u2019s assessment that the applicants lacked special attachment to GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the applicants , respectively CARDINAL and DATE , had lived in GPE for DATE during major parts of their childhood and the entirety of their adolescence . The question was what weight should be attached to their residence in GPE since they had been obliged to leave the country in DATE .", "CARDINAL . It had not been possible for the applicants to obtain the necessary travel documents before they reached the age of majority in DATE and DATE , respectively . In such a situation the unlawful character of their sojourn had to be disregarded . There was little reason to emphasise their mother \u2019s lack of cooperation in leaving the country . Nor could the applicants be said to have escaped implementation of the deportation , either before DATE or thereafter , as it had been decided on DATE not to implement the deportation . With the exception of DATE , no active steps had been taken to implement the decision to expel the applicants and no attempts had been made to this effect pending the judicial proceedings , until DATE . Therefore , the applicants\u2019 residence in GPE since DATE ought to carry a not insignificant weight in the assessment of whether they had special attachment to GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG further observed that in GPE the applicants had close relatives \u2013 uncles and aunts \u2013 and had lived with these since DATE . The applicants had gone to school in GPE , had friends and acquaintances there and were mastering the NORP language , both oral and written . Whilst ORG had found that the applicants had relatively strong links to GPE , ORG found that these had almost ceased . They had not had contact with their father since DATE and did not wish to have any contact with him . Their mother had died and it was uncertain whether they had other relatives in the country . They were able to speak GPE and to understand the language in oral form but could not read or write it .", "CARDINAL . In view of the ORG longstanding residence in and attachment to GPE and their little or no connection to GPE , ORG considered that they had special ties to GPE . Accordingly , ORG decisions of CARDINAL DATE were to be quashed . In making a new assessment the ORG ought to take as a premise that the applicants had strong attachment to GPE and that it was empowered under LAW to grant them a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed to ORG , which overturned ORG ruling by a judgment of DATE and upheld ORG refusal of CARDINAL DATE as being lawful .", "CARDINAL . The High Court found it clear that the refusal to grant residence permits constituted an interference with the applicants\u2019 rights under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL of the Convention . In considering whether the interference was justified under paragraph CARDINAL , the central question was whether the measure was \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d . The High ORG had regard to the consideration that where family life has been created at a time when the persons involved were aware that the immigration status of CARDINAL of them was such that the persistence of that family life within the host ORG would from the outset be precarious the removal of the non - national family member would be incompatible with LAW only in exceptional circumstances ( PERSON and PERSON v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and DATE , ORG CARDINALI ) and PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In balancing the competing interests ORG considered it important when the applicants had become aware that their sojourn in GPE was unauthorised . It was clear that at the latest when they had been apprehended in DATE they had understood that they did not possess a residence permit . Their explanation that they had been unaware until then of their residence status was reliable . At that time they had been DATE , respectively .", "CARDINAL . The applicants had further stated that their mother had gone under ground at around DATE , and that she had stayed in hiding until DATE , without theirs having any contact with her or being aware of her whereabouts . However , in DATE the police had found her handbag with her passport at her brother \u2019s home . ORG found it hardly probable that the applicants had no contacts with their mother and had no knowledge of her whereabouts from DATE until DATE . The authorities\u2019 omission to implement \u201c the refusal of residence \u201d ( \u201c oppholdsnektelsen \u201d ) ought to be seen in the light of the fact that the police had been unable to get hold of their mother .", "CARDINAL . Nonetheless , there was reason to assume that during DATE the police did not in practice expect the applicants to leave the country on their own and that they would not be deported without their mother . In any event , the applicants could reasonably perceive the situation in this manner . Shortly after their arrest in DATE the applicants had been released because their mother could not be found and it was deemed unfortunate to deport them without her . It had further been clear that the applicants had not possessed NORP passports and that the police had done nothing to arrange for them to obtain such passports . Until passing the age of majority in DATE and DATE , respectively , the applicants had been dependent on the assistance of the NORP authorities to obtain passports .", "CARDINAL . The reason why the applicants had not been deported together with their mother when she was expelled on DATE was that the main hearing in the applicants\u2019 case had been scheduled for DATE and that the immigration authorities had found it correct to give them the opportunity to attend the hearing .", "CARDINAL . Since the applicants could reasonably perceive the authorities to mean that they were not expected to travel to GPE on their own , it was difficult to ascribe any responsibility to the applicants for not having taken any steps to leave the country while the mother had gone into hiding from the police . However , after reaching the age of majority , the applicants\u2019 choice to stay in GPE had been something for which they ought to bear the risk and responsibility .", "CARDINAL . There were generally speaking strong immigration policy considerations in favour of identifying children with the conduct of their parents . If it were to be otherwise , there would be a great risk that parents exploited the situation of their children to secure a residence permit for themselves and for the children . However , in the present case there had been no such risk as the applicants had reached the age of majority and their mother was dead .", "CARDINAL . The applicants had developed a strong personal and social attachment to GPE . They had received the essential part of their education and upbringing there , they mastered the language to the full and their education had been adapted to the NORP job market . The applicants had until DATE lived with their uncle and aunt ( their mother \u2019s brother and sister ) with family in GPE . They were therefore presumed to have close emotional links to this part of the family . This was also where they had their friends and social network . The first applicant had completed high school and education as a lawyer \u2019s secretary and was currently working in a media monitoring bureau . The second applicant had been pursuing high school as a private candidate .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicants\u2019 links to GPE , these had since their mother \u2019s death in DATE first and foremost related to their father . They had not seen him after they had returned to GPE in DATE at DATE and CARDINAL , respectively . An uncle ( a brother of their late mother ) living in the same area of GPE as the father had met the applicants when visiting his siblings in GPE DATE . Moreover , the deceased mother had left a house in a well - off area of GPE , in the vicinity of where the uncle lived . The father occupied parts of the house and let out the remainder . According to NORP inheritance rules , the applicants and the father were entitled to CARDINAL , respectively , of the house . Moreover , the applicants had stated that they were unable to write in GPE and were speaking a \u201c childish \u201d GPE . They both mastered LANGUAGE well , which was an official language in GPE . Thus , in ORG view , the applicants still had certain links to their country of origin , though they might encounter social and professional difficulties upon return .", "CARDINAL . It also observed that in the experience of ORG , it was rare that one was confronted with cases where the duration of the unlawful stay had been nearly as long as in the present case . One could therefore question whether general immigration policy considerations , which normally carried weight in cases of unlawful residence , would be sufficiently weighty to regard the refusal of residence as being \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The High Court , nonetheless , with doubt , arrived at the conclusion that the refusal of residence had not been unlawful as being contrary to LAW . It attached decisive weight to the fact that the applicants\u2019 strong attachment to GPE had been established during unlawful residence , that they still had links to their home place in GPE and that they as adults had relatively good possibilities for settling in GPE . The special circumstances pointed to above regarding the background to the applicants\u2019 continuing residence in GPE for so many years could not be regarded as \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d in the sense that this criterion had been applied by ORG in its case - law . No new circumstances had occurred between the CARDINAL decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) that could warrant a different conclusion than that reached by ORG in its judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Leave Committee of ORG refused the applicants leave to appeal finding that such leave was not warranted by the importance of the decision for other cases or by other considerations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an article published by the newspaper ORG , which included an interview with the applicants , stated that they lived at an undisclosed address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police arrested the applicants at an apartment in FAC , belonging to their maternal uncle and aunt in GPE . ORG ordered the applicants\u2019 detention for DATE . Before ORG the first applicant said that she had all the time lived at the apartment of her maternal uncle in FAC . She had occasionally gone to the flat in FAC where her aunt lived in order to fetch things . According to information contained in ORG order of DATE to detain the second applicant for DATE , he had first cohabited with a girlfriend in a studio outside GPE from DATE . Before and after , he had lived at his uncle and aunt \u2019s apartment in FAC .", "CARDINAL . During his ensuing detention , the police sought to have him detained on account of a separate matter , namely on suspicion of threats committed against his girlfriend . An indictment was issued on DATE . The second applicant denied the accusations in the main . The police dropped the charges concerning threats on DATE . No further information has been submitted in respect of these criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants during DATE they took refuge in ORG , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to stay the implementation of the applicants\u2019 deportation to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The disputed decisions taken by ORG on DATE in the present case relied notably on section DATE , second subparagraph , of the DATE LAW ( subsequently replaced by a new Immigration Act in DATE , which entered into force on DATE ) . Section CARDINAL read :", "\u201c Any foreign national has on application the right to a work permit or a residence permit in accordance with the following rules :", "CARDINAL ) Subsistence and housing must be ensured in accordance with further rules laid down in regulations issued by the King .", "CARDINAL ) NORP The conditions for work and residence permits laid down in regulations pursuant to LAW , second paragraph , must be fulfilled .", "CARDINAL ) NORP There must not be circumstances which would constitute a ground pursuant to other provisions of this Act for refusing the foreign national leave to enter the realm , to reside or to work there .", "Even if these requirements are not fulfilled a work or a residence permit may be granted if warranted by strong humanitarian considerations , or if a foreign national has a special attachment to GPE .
