De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , Mr PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals who live in GPE PERSON . They were represented before the ORG by Mr J. Janas , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr J. PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE Tsar PERSON , then ORG , had issued a decree ( ukaz ) granting the inhabitants of the Rosochaty R\u00f3g village a profit \u00e0 prendre which amounted to a right to fish from shore in the Wigry and GPE . The right was approved on DATE by ORG and entered in the NORP land register in DATE . The right to fish was enjoyed only by those peasants who had the right entered in their so - called \u201c liquidation tables \u201d , and after their death by their legal heirs .", "CARDINAL . In DATE GPE regained independence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW was adopted ( ustawa wodna ) which introduced a general rule that all waters were public unless they constituted private property pursuant to the LAW or pursuant to special legal titles . Subsequently , further numerous legal acts were adopted aimed at nationalisation of waters .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are owners of land adjacent to LOC .", "CARDINAL . In DATE they filed a statement of claim with ORG ( PERSON ) against ORG in which they referred to the Tsar \u2019s decree of DATE , granting the inhabitants of the Rosochaty R\u00f3g village a profit \u00e0 prendre which amounted to a right to fish in LOC . They stressed that the owners of the land adjacent to the lake had benefited from the right to fish in the lake until DATE , when the director of ORG had prohibited the applicants from fishing there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered a judgment in which it found that since DATE the applicants had had a right to fish in the lake , which had not been revoked by any of the subsequent legal regulations . The court specified that the right was limited to the right to fish from the shore , without using boats or platforms . In addition , the fishermen had to respect the fish - protection periods .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) upheld the firstinstance judgment . The judgment is final .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants filed another statement of claim against ORG in which they asked the court to declare that their fishing rights comprised also the right to fish from a platform and while standing in the water .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment . It confirmed that the applicants had a right to fish for their own needs in LOC and that they could exercise that right from their land , from a platform or while standing in the water .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that decision .", "CARDINAL . On the defendant \u2019s appeal , on DATE ORG ( PERSON ) quashed both judgments and dismissed the claim . It held that since DATE at DATE when the new FAC had come into force - the applicants\u2019 right to fish in LOC had expired . The court stressed that by virtue of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of that Act all waters in GPE had been nationalised . It further considered that nationalisation constituted a primary method of acquiring property so that ownership of the waters had been transferred to the ORG without any servitudes .", "CARDINAL . ORG , inter alia , found :", "\u201c The lower courts omitted the consequences for the existence of the claimants\u2019 fishing rights which follow from sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "In accordance with the unanimous opinion of the legal doctrine and of the jurisprudence this LAW led to nationalisation of waters . ( ... ) In line with the generally accepted approach the nationalisation constitutes a primary method of acquiring property which signifies that the title to property is transferred to the ORG free from any servitudes , unless the nationalisation act provides for an exception in this respect . ( ... )", "Thus , it can be reasonably argued that private waters were nationalised free from any servitudes . Although , generally speaking , in the present case the right to fish encumbered the ORG object from the outset , nevertheless the primary goal of the nationalisation of waters ( rationalisation of their use ) argues in favour of the view that this nationalisation , a fortiori , led to the expiry of the property rights ( prawa rzeczowe ) encumbering ORG waters . Thus , even if the fishing rights had not expired earlier , they did so on the date of the entry into force of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants subsequently filed a constitutional complaint . On DATE the Constitutional Court refused to examine it . The applicants appealed . On DATE ORG allowed their appeal and decided to consider their case .", "CARDINAL . The applicants subsequently filed a request with ORG , for the reopening of the proceedings that had been terminated on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon a question of law referred by the Ombudsman relating to fishing rights in other lakes , ORG adopted a resolution ( III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and stressed that the fishing rights had been unenforceable since DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG request for reopening .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision in which it discontinued the proceedings in the applicants\u2019 case on formal grounds . It held that the constitutional complaint had not concerned an alleged unconstitutionality of a legal provision but rather a flawed application by ORG to the facts of the case . One of the judges in his dissenting opinion considered that even assuming that the applicants\u2019 right to fish in LOC was a property right , it had been limited by LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW was adopted ( ustawa o rybo\u0142\u00f3stwie ) . The LAW stipulated that the right to fish was linked to the ownership of the waters in question . In public waters the right belonged to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . By DATE CARDINAL of LAW ( prawo wodne ) all waters in GPE were nationalised . The LAW is no longer in force . Currently , the legal status of inland waters is regulated by LAW of DATE which entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( ustawa o ochronie przyrody ) of DATE , as worded at the material time , provided that fishing was prohibited in natural parks , with the exception of areas specifically designated in the conservation plans . The LAW was amended and this provision repealed on DATE . LAW ( CARDINAL ) paragraphCARDINAL now provides :", "\u201c Catching fish and other water - borne living organisms with the exception of areas specifically designated in the conservation plans [ is prohibited ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG referred to ORG a question of law ( pytanie prawne ) as to whether the fishing rights granted in DATE ( to fish in certain PERSON lakes ) had expired in DATE with the adoption of the new LAW . The Ombudsman referred to the divergent practice of the domestic courts and ORG in examining such claims .", "CARDINAL . In its resolution of DATE ( III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , adopted by a bench of CARDINAL judges , ORG dealt with this question . The court referred to LAW and concluded that the fishing rights granted in DATE had not expired in DATE . However , they had been unenforceable since the entry into force of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
