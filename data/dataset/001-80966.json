THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON and PERSON , are a married couple . They are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They were represented before the Court by Ms S. Land , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE , the applicants applied for asylum in the GPE . They claimed that the first applicant had attracted the negative attention of the NORP authorities for having publicly criticised the latter . The second applicant \u2019s asylum claim was mainly based on the first applicant \u2019s alleged problems . On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) rejected the applicants\u2019 asylum request . Their objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision was declared inadmissible by the Deputy Minister on DATE for having been filed out of time . The ORG subsequent appeal was rejected on DATE by ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch .", "On DATE , the applicants filed a new asylum request based on newly emerged facts and circumstances within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) . This new request was rejected on DATE by the Deputy Minister , who noted , inter alia , that the first applicant had submitted and relied on a summons issued by ORG , addressed to his father and relating to the applicant , whereas \u2013 according to an individual official report ( individueel ambtsbericht ) drawn up on DATE by the Minister of ORG on an inquiry carried out \u2013 this document was not authentic . As the applicants had failed to react to the conclusion set out in this individual report , the Deputy Minister concluded that no credence could be attached to the applicants\u2019 asylum account . The applicants unsuccessfully challenged this decision in administrative appeal proceedings . The final , negative decision on this second asylum request was taken on DATE by ORG of The GPE sitting in PERSON .", "On DATE , the applicants filed a third asylum request based on , inter alia , an allegedly authenticated copy of a judgment given on DATE by ORG in which the first applicant had been convicted and sentenced for political opposition activities .", "The final , negative decision on this third asylum request was given on DATE by ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) in which it rejected the ORG appeal against the refusal of the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON Integratie ; the successor of the Deputy Minister of ORG ) to grant them asylum . As regards the copy of the judgment relied on by the applicants , ORG held that the copy submitted did not constitute a \u201c new fact \u201d warranting a reconsideration of the applicants\u2019 asylum claim as \u2013 for want of reference materials \u2013 its authenticity could not be determined by ORG ( ORG ) whilst the applicants had not demonstrated by means of evidence and arguments that it was an authentic NORP document and had given contradictory accounts about the manner in which it had been obtained .", "On DATE , the respondent Government were requested under Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of ORG to draw up an individual official report on , inter alia , the authenticity of the NORP judgment of DATE relied on by the applicants in their third asylum request .", "Following certain steps taken by the respondent Government , apparently aimed at the applicants\u2019 actual expulsion to GPE , the ORG decided on DATE to indicate to the Government , under Rule CARDINAL of ORG and until further notice , not to expel the applicants . The ORG further endorsed the request to ORG under Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) .", "By letters of CARDINAL and DATE , the respondent Government informed the ORG that , according to the findings of an inquiry carried out in GPE , the judgment of DATE was not an authentic document .", "The applicants\u2019 brief comments in reply contained in their letter of CARDINAL DATE did not address the findings of the inquiry conducted in GPE . The applicants merely informed the ORG that they seemed to be eligible for a GPE residence permit under a general amnesty arrangement set out in the new ORG \u2019s coalition agreement ( coalitieakkoord ) of CARDINAL DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
