THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . She is represented before the Court by Mr FAC ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant \u2019s partner , PERSON , was killed on DATE in PERSON during a fight between supporters of the GPE soccer club LOC and supporters of the GPE soccer club PERSON . Following an investigation by the regional police GPE \u2013 PERSON of the killing of PERSON , a number of suspects were arrested .", "Shortly afterwards , the regional police GPE - Amstelland opened an investigation into whether and to what extent LOC supporters formed part of a criminal organisation specifically involved in ( the organisation of ) fights and/or street vandalism and violence . In this context , the GPE public prosecutor ( officier van justitie ) opened a preliminary judicial investigation ( gerechtelijk vooronderzoek ) against NN ( nomen nescio ; i.e. against a person or persons unknown ) .", "In the course of this preliminary judicial investigation and upon the request of the public prosecutor , the investigating judge ( rechtercommissaris ) authorised the tapping of a telephone line , the number for which was registered in the applicant \u2019s name . It was tapped DATE and DATE . In addition , the investigating judge authorised that a print - out be obtained of all telephone communications having taken place on this line DATE and DATE . At no point did any suspicions arise that the applicant herself had been involved in any criminal activities .", "The lawyer who was acting on the applicant \u2019s behalf in the criminal proceedings against the suspected perpetrators of the killing of PERSON , and who also acted as defence counsel in criminal proceedings against a soccer supporter called PERSON , learned of the existence of the tapping of the applicant \u2019s telephone , as it was mentioned in PERSON \u2019s case - file . With PERSON \u2019s permission , the lawyer informed the applicant of the tapping of her telephone .", "In a letter of DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer put the following questions to the public prosecutor :", "\u201c a. Is it correct that the above telephone number has been tapped under your responsibility ?", "b. If so , during which period has this taken place ?", "c. Can you tell me when you informed my client of this , i.e. that her telephone was tapped during a certain period ?", "d. In case this has not taken place so far , when would you have intended to do so and , if so , mentioning what grounds ?", "e. What were the reasons for the \u201c tapping \u201d and of what criminal offence was she suspected ?", "f. Is she still suspected of having committed that criminal offence ?", "g. Would you kindly provide me , on behalf of < the applicant > , with a copy of all conversations that were recorded and listened to , in particular all the formal records of interception ( processen \u2013 verbaal van opname ) . \u201d", "In his reply of DATE , the public prosecutor informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer as follows :", "\u201c In answer to a number of your questions I could refer you to the formal record that is already in your possession in your capacity as the lawyer of the suspect PERSON On page CARDINAL of that record it is set out that and why the telephone of your client < the applicant > has been tapped . I will nevertheless reply to your questions point by point .", "a. Yes .", "b. From DATE to DATE .", "c. I have not informed her of this .", "d. I did not have the intention to inform her of this , since the tapping took place in the context of a preliminary judicial investigation against NN .", "e. Your client was the partner of PERSON , who was killed during the clash between ORG and PERSON supporters in PERSON and who was formerly a barkeeper in the caf\u00e9 U. , that was owned by your client and where , according to the information of ORG ( Criminele Inlichtingen ORG ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) , the hard core group of ORG supporters gathered . On this ground it was considered plausible that as yet unknown members of the hard core group , who were involved in acts of violence , could have contacts via the telephone number at issue . Your client was not suspected of a criminal offence in this connection .", "f. See the last sentence under e.", "g. No . The tapping has \u2013 as said \u2013 not taken place in the context of criminal proceedings against your client . A number of intercepted telephone conversations have been added to the note requesting authorisation to conduct a house search in connection with one of the suspects . In consultation with the investigating judge , it has been decided to grant you access to those conversations . \u201d", "In his letter of DATE to the public prosecutor , the applicant \u2019s lawyer pointed out , inter alia , that the applicant had sold caf\u00e9 U. DATE and that it would have been understandable had the caf\u00e9 \u2019s telephone been tapped , but the fact that the applicant \u2019s private telephone line had been tapped was incomprehensible . The lawyer requested the information which had led to the telephone tapping , and a copy of the memoranda and other evidentiary items indicating that the applicant \u2019s telephone line would be used by members of the hard core group , and that these persons maintained contacts via this telephone .", "In his reply of DATE , the public prosecutor stated inter alia :", "\u201c ... My answer is possibly understandable ... when you see the situation as a whole and not only for a part thereof .", "Let me , in spite of this , formulate it differently : your client was the owner of a caf\u00e9 where the group of ORG hard core supporters met regularly . The suspicion that members of this hard core group would maintain contacts via the private telephone line of your client is not so incomprehensible when account is taken of the fact that your client \u2019s partner , PERSON , apparently belonged to that group since he went along to the planned violent clash between the hard core of ORG supporters and the hard core of PERSON supporters , during which clash he was killed .", "In any event , the investigating judge considered this sufficient to issue an authorisation for tapping the telephone number concerned .", "Since your client is not a suspect in this case , I will not add the \u2018 memoranda and other evidentiary ORG requested by you . \u201d", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer transmitted a copy of the letter of DATE to the investigating judge , requesting a copy of the documents he had asked for in his letter of CARDINAL DATE . Despite a reminder sent on DATE , it remained unanswered .", "Until DATE , the rules about the interception of communications made through public telecommunication networks or services were set out in Articles CARDINALf - h of LAW ( PERSON ; the \u201c ORG \u201d ) . Further rules on the practical exercise of the power to intercept communications were set out in LAW ( PERSON ) of DATE , a copy of which could be obtained by any interested person . The text of these Guidelines had further been published in , inter alia , ORG ( Nederlands Tijdschrift voor de Mensenrechten ) of DATE . These Guidelines , which did not have the formal character of law , had been issued as a model letter from the senior public prosecutors to the police .", "The above rules initially only covered communications by telephone . As from DATE , when ORG ( Wet op de Computercriminaliteit ) entered into force , they also covered communications by fax and e - mail . On DATE , when the Act of CARDINAL DATE on amendments of the ORG in relation to special methods of criminal investigation entered into force , the provisions of LAW of the ORG were replaced by ORG CARDINAL m and ORG .", "Pursuant to LAW ORG , as in force at the material time , the tapping of communications can only be effected in regard to offences for which detention on remand ( voorlopige hechtenis ) may be imposed , i.e. offences of a certain gravity carrying a punishment of imprisonment of DATE or more ( LAW ORG ) . The tapping can only concern communications in which a suspect is likely to participate , and it can only be ordered where the investigation urgently requires it . It must be authorised by the investigating judge . Furthermore , a record ( proces - verbaal ) of the tapping must be prepared within TIME .", "Under LAW ORG , as in force at the relevant time , records without importance for the investigation must be destroyed as soon as possible by order of the investigating judge . As to the destruction of information obtained via the interception of telephone conversations , the standard practice in fact differed from the Guidelines . On the basis of , inter alia , the ORG \u2019s findings in the cases of ORG and PERSON v. GPE ( judgments of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A&B ) as regards the possibility of inspection by the judge and by the defence , the official records and transcripts of tapped telephone conversations were not destroyed immediately but were kept until shortly after the closure of the case . Anyone requesting access to such material was required to give reasons for such a request .", "Where no suspect can be identified immediately and in order to obtain a tapping authorisation from the investigating judge , a preliminary judicial investigation against a person or persons unknown ( \u201c NN \u201d ) may be opened . As soon as the name(s ) of the suspected perpetrator(s ) can be established , the preliminary judicial investigation is to be put in the name of the suspect(s ) concerned ( LAW ORG ) . By subsequently availing him or herself of the right to be granted access to the case - file ( LAW ORG ) , a suspect can become aware of the fact that communications have been tapped during the investigation .", "Until DATE , the Code of Criminal Procedure itself contained no provision on the period during which tapping of telecommunications may be carried out . However , pursuant to the Guidelines on the Interception of Telephone Conversations , a period of not DATE was set . PERSON could also not exceed DATE . After DATE the responsible police officer was required to submit an interim report to the public prosecutor and the investigating judge . The provisions of ORG CARDINAL m and FAC , as in force as from DATE , incorporated these DATE rules ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
