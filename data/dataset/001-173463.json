However , the court refused to call them .

The court examined and dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim that the explosives had been planted on her .

The court further found that the applicant must have drafted the text of the handwritten note herself and that she had not copied it from NORP websites on the Internet , as she had claimed , since the note had contained modifications and corrections .", "CARDINAL .

They further complained that the court had unreasonably refused their request to be allowed to question police officer A. and that there had been no documents in the case file showing that A. had been away on a work - related mission at the time of the hearing . Moreover , the court should have called the attesting witnesses , PERSON and PERSON , because they could have testified about the circumstances preceding the personal search of the applicant in the police station .", "DATE .

ORG held that the videotape had been shown at the request of the defence and that no objections or complaints had been lodged with the court after the videotape had been played , including that not all of the videotapes had been shown .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that the questioning of A. had not been possible due to his absence on a work - related mission and that his pre - trial statement had been read out with the consent of the defence . As for CARDINAL attesting witnesses PERSON and PERSON , their personal appearance had not been necessary since the applicant claimed that the explosives had been planted in her bag before their arrival . In any event , the defence agreed to proceed to the closing arguments and had not had any objections or additional requests about the examination of the applicant \u2019s case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-b", "6-3-d"]}
