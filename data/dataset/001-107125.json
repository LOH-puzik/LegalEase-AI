The applicant was born in DATE and currently lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at DATE , she arrived in GPE . The following day she applied to ORG ( Migrationsverket ) for asylum and a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel was appointed for the applicant , who in a communication of CARDINAL DATE and during an interview on DATE held by ORG , stated her reasons for requesting asylum as follows . The applicant was born and raised in GPE in a family which had been NORP for several generations . She had a university degree and had taught GPE in a secondary school in GPE from DATE until she left the country . She was married , but had been separated from her husband since DATE . Her parents and CARDINAL of her siblings remained in GPE . In DATE she had become active in a NORP organisation called ORG , ORG ( NORP JPIC ) . She had worked as a volunteer in her free time and the purpose of the NORP JPIC had been to create understanding between NORP and NORP and to carry out charity work on a local level . She had , inter alia , helped women in vulnerable situations . In DATE she and some of the members of the organisation had been threatened and harassed through letters and text messages to their mobile phones . She was convinced that religious fundamentalists were responsible for the threats because they wrongly believed that the NORP JPIC tried to convert NORP to ORG . Her father had destroyed the CARDINAL or CARDINAL letters which had come to their home and she had only read CARDINAL of them . She had read CARDINAL text messages , thereafter she disposed of her ORG card . In TIME CARDINAL DATE , following TIME mass , she had been travelling on the organisation \u2019s minibus with the President , Vice - President and CARDINAL other members when they had been stopped by CARDINAL fundamentalists on motorbikes . She seemed to remember that the minibus had a red cross on the roof . The assailants had used cricket bats to try to break the windows of the minibus and had accused the group of blasphemy against ORG . The driver had succeeded in driving away from the assailants . The President of the organisation had reported the assault to the police . Thereafter , the applicant lived with her aunt in another town until she left GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s arrival in GPE , she was informed by her father that she had been formally accused of blasphemy and that an arrest warrant had been issued against her . Her father sent her a copy of the arrest warrant and of a police report , but she did not know how her father had obtained them or where the originals were . She believed that the arrest order had only been shown to her father . Later , he also sent her a copy of a summons , but she was not sure whether it was an arrest warrant or a summons ; she would have to verify that with her father . The said documents could be described as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A copy of poor quality of a document in GPE which was not translated . According to the applicant , the translation was the \u201c ORG \u201d ( FIR ) lodged by CARDINAL named persons at a GPE police station on DATE . It was registered as ORG . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and contained accusations against the applicant and CARDINAL other members of the NORP JPIC of having violated Articles CARDINAL(b ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW . The document stated that the person who lodged the report attacked and assaulted the applicant and CARDINAL others and tried to kill them . It further stated that the attackers searched for the applicant in her home with the intention of killing her .", "CARDINAL .

A copy of a certificate written by the President of ORG , dated DATE , in which he certified that the applicant was an acting member of the NORP JPIC GPE and that she had visited him to ask for help because she felt threatened by religious fundamentalists . She and her colleagues had reported this to the police and the President had also looked into her claims together with his team and had found that the applicant \u2019s life was endangered by religious fundamentalists . He considered that the applicant was in need of complete protection .", "CARDINAL . A copy of a certificate dated DATE by the Director of the NORP Justice , FAC and ORG , Custody of GPE the GPE , GPE . The Director certified that the applicant had been an active member of the organisation since DATE and that she had voluntarily devoted her time to the organisation . The organisation worked for peace and justice and to bring harmony through interfaith dialogue in order to allow different religions to understand each other . They also assisted poor people , in particular women . It was further stated that the applicant and other members of the organisation had received life - threatening calls , letters and text messages . CARDINAL times , unknown persons had thrown stones at them . NORP extremists wanted to kill them and their families because the extremists mistakenly believe that the organisation wants to convert NORP to ORG . The last threatening letter had stated that the members of the NORP JPIC were \u201c kafar \u201d and that the authors had commenced \u201c jihad \u201d against them and would kill them . They also threatened to have them punished through the blasphemy laws . The organisation had reported this to the police but without results so they had stopped their activities . The Director requested that the applicant be granted asylum in order to save her life .", "CARDINAL . A copy of a letter very similar to the CARDINAL above but written by the President of the NORP JPIC , dated DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the application . It first noted that neither the general situation in GPE nor the general situation for NORP in GPE were such as to justify granting the applicant protection in GPE . As concerned her personal grounds , ORG considered that the certificates from the NORP JPIC did not substantiate that she had been the victim of threats and harassment . Moreover , the arrest warrant did not state expressly why she was sought by the authorities . Hence , even if the documents were real , they did not show that she would risk being punished for blasphemy in a discriminatory manner . The ORG further questioned whether the police report was genuine as the applicant had handed it in to ORG after she had submitted the arrest warrant . It also found it unlikely that persons would admit to crimes in a report to the police giving their names and details , since making threats and assaulting someone were also crimes in GPE . Lastly , it found it remarkable that the applicant could not explain how her father had obtained the documents . Hence , the documents did not substantiate the applicant \u2019s story . Turning to her credibility , ORG considered that the applicant had given a rather vague and unclear account . She had also altered some of her statements and , in large parts , her story was based on information from her father , as he had read and destroyed the letters and obtained the documents concerning blasphemy . Furthermore , the applicant had not been able to explain why she had been of particular interest to the fundamentalists as opposed to the others who had been prominent members of the organisation . Her explanation , that she had been very active as a volunteer and thus visible , was not convincing to ORG . In any event , the acts of which she had been the victim were criminal acts and for the NORP authorities to deal with . Although some discrimination existed in NORP society , it was not so flagrant that it could be said that the authorities lacked ability or willingness to protect its citizens . In this respect , the ORG observed that the applicant had not reported any of the threats , and that her family had not tried to find out the details about why the police were looking for her . It did not consider that the applicant faced a real and concrete risk of being punished for blasphemy . Furthermore , it noted that the applicant had an aunt in another city and that , since the NORP JPIC according to the applicant was a very small and local organisation , she should be able to avoid problems by settling in the same city as her aunt . Consequently , the ORG concluded that the applicant was not in need of protection in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) and requested a change of lawyer . She alleged that her sister had been kidnapped and her parents had disappeared . She further alleged that she could not live with her aunt , as her cousin had abused her while she had been staying with them in DATE . She pointed out that the warrant of arrest did state why she was sought by the authorities in that it made reference to LAW which concerned defiling and similar of the Holy Koran and could lead to imprisonment for life . Reference had also been made to LAW , which concerned the use of derogatory remarks and similar in respect of ORG and could lead to the death sentence . Furthermore , she had received CARDINAL leaflets from a friend in GPE showing that fatwas had been issued against her and her colleagues in the NORP JPIC . Also , it was clear that the applicant , as a NORP and as a woman , could not count on the protection of the police . Instead , going to a police station where there were only NORP men would put her at further risk of abuse . Furthermore , the organisation had reported the threats to the police and the other members at risk had also fled the country . Lastly , she stated that she was in very poor mental health following the disappearance of her family , which she considered to be her fault .", "CARDINAL . She submitted , inter alia , the following documents :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A copy of a letter dated DATE sent by the applicant to the President of ORG informing him , inter alia , that the organisation had received threatening letters and that CARDINAL times unknown persons had thrown stones at them .", "CARDINAL . A copy of a letter by the President of ORG in GPE , dated DATE , and addressed to the Inspector General of Police in GPE . It referred to a letter from the applicant as \u201c acting member , NORP JPIC GPE , \u201d which the President had received and which he enclosed ( it referred to the threats made by extremists against the applicant and other members of the NORP JPIC ) . The President was asking the Inspector General to take the necessary legal action in order to protect the life of the applicant and her colleagues .", "CARDINAL . A copy of a handwritten letter from the NORP JPIC to ORG in GPE in which they reported that they had been attacked , when travelling on their bus , by a group of unknown men who had thrown stones at them . The letter was stamped as received at FAC on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A CARDINAL - page leaflet in LANGUAGE which , allegedly , was a fatwa issued by PERSON and in which the applicant and the other named members of the NORP JPIC were accused of having insulted Allah and the Prophet . They should therefore be killed in Jihad and the person who carried out this deed would be allowed into heaven . He requested all NORP to join in this work of justice .", "CARDINAL . A CARDINAL - page leaflet in LANGUAGE which , allegedly , described how NORP were insulted by other religions and stated that the applicant and other named members of the NORP JPIC had insulted the Koran and the PERSON . It requested ORG to arrest the guilty parties immediately and to hang them . If not , it was all ORG duty to participate in Jihad against the infidels and to kill them .", "CARDINAL . A medical certificate by a physician in psychiatry dated DATE , which stated that the applicant had been treated at the clinic CARDINAL DATE for suicidal thoughts . According to the physician the applicant was suffering from serious depression and ORG ( PTSD ) , In particular , the applicant was worried about returning to GPE and her relatives in GPE . Some family members had fallen ill and her sister had been kidnapped .", "CARDINAL . A medical certificate , dated DATE , written by the same doctor as above . It stated that the applicant had been in treatment since DATE . She had been committed to a closed psychiatric unit DATE because she had collapsed and had suffered from a serious mental disorder , including suicidal thoughts and depression . Due to her severe depression she had been treated with ECT ( electric shocks ) . Since then she had been taking antidepressants and seeing a doctor DATE . In DATE she had been found still to be suffering from severe depression and she claimed to hear voices from her family and sometimes to see them in front of her . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s request for a change of counsel was rejected by ORG , notably because the case was almost ready for judgment and the acknowledged differences between counsel and the applicant could not justify a change of counsel . Leave to appeal against that decision was refused by ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing during which the applicant was heard . Her appointed counsel was present , as well as an adviser . The applicant maintained that her parents had disappeared DATE after they had reported the kidnapping of her sister to the police . When the applicant had learned what had happened to her family , she was admitted to hospital .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ORG found against the applicant . From the outset it considered that the written evidence submitted in the case was of low evidential value as the copies were of very poor quality and unclear . The leaflets allegedly containing fatwas issued against the applicant , for example , which were shown to the court in originals ( documents nos . CARDINAL and DATE ) , could easily be produced and did not have much weight as evidence . Moreover , the applicant had not known how her father had obtained the alleged arrest warrant or the police report ( FIR ) . As concerned the applicant \u2019s credibility in general , the court found that her story had been vague and uncertain , in particular in respect of the content of the threats . She had claimed that her father had protected her from most of the threats arriving at the home by letter and telephone and , hence , she could not account for their content . She had also claimed that she did not know the identity of those who had threatened her . In the court \u2019s view , however , this was rather contradictory since these persons allegedly had stated their names in the FIR . It thus appeared odd that they would have made anonymous threats . Furthermore , in the ORG the persons had written that they had sought the applicant at her home with the purpose of killing her . However , the applicant had not mentioned this at all . Also , the court considered that the threat against the applicant appeared disproportionate having regard to the fact that she had not been a member of the organisation , just a volunteer , and that she had not held any prominent or official role . Allegedly , the organisation was very small and worked only locally . As concerned the applicant \u2019s family in GPE , the court noted that it was very unclear what had happened to them . In any event , it had not been substantiated that their alleged disappearance had anything to do with the threats against the applicant . Lastly , it considered that the applicant was suffering from poor mental health but that this was not life - threatening or so serious that it could justify the granting of asylum in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , relying on the same grounds as previously . She added that the President of the NORP JPIC had been granted asylum in GPE and that the Vice - President had been granted asylum in GPE . She submitted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A medical certificate dated DATE issued by the physician in psychiatry mentioned in documents CARDINAL and CARDINAL . He stated that the applicant was still under treatment at the out - patient psychiatric unit and that she was suffering from an acute crisis reaction and a severely depressive period . He concluded that the applicant \u2019s mental state of health was fairly bad and that the risk for suicide was probably high . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
