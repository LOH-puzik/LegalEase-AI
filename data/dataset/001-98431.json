They live in GPE . Mr Shimidzu was represented before the ORG by PERSON D. ORG , a barrister practising in GPE ; PERSON by PERSON PERSON , a barrister also practising in GPE . They were each assisted by ORG and Mr C. Nicholls GPE , counsel .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL DATE , the first applicant , PERSON , was tried before a judge and jury in ORG on charges of assault occasioning bodily harm , obstructing a police officer and resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty . He was acquitted by the jury after a submission of no case to answer was rejected by the trial judge . When Mr ORG \u2019s counsel made application for costs after the trial , the Chief Justice said :", "\u201c But , PERSON , you know that you ca n\u2019t get costs . I would grant them , if I could , you know that the law is against you . \u201d", "When counsel persisted the Chief Justice said :", "\u201c You keep trying , PERSON , I understand why you keep trying , but in my opinion it is an unjust system , which says , you can award costs against the defendant on conviction , you can not award costs in ORG on acquittal . It is not a just system , but it \u2019s not something that I can get round , however much I would enjoy trying to weave it . I just can not , and it is a matter for the ORG , but it is a matter perhaps that the ORG ought to be invited to give their attention to . \u201d", "On DATE , the second applicant , PERSON , was tried before the same court on charges of rape . At the conclusion of the prosecution case , the trial judge upheld a defence submission of no case to answer and , on his direction , the jury acquitted the second applicant .", "Mr ORG made a motion to challenge the refusal to award costs . This was referred by ORG to ORG of Gibraltar on DATE .", "PERSON was given leave to intervene in the proceedings before ORG in Mr Shimidzu \u2019s case . Before ORG , the applicants argued , inter alia , that the relevant provision of NORP criminal law , section CARDINAL of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance , violated LAW . They relied on sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . In respect of section CARDINAL , they argued that LAW violated their right to a fair hearing and was a violation of the presumption of innocence . It appears that it was accepted before ORG that while section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) allowed ORG to order the prosecution to pay costs to an acquitted defendant , all defendants before ORG would be unable to fulfil the conditions laid down in CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) since in order for a person to be committed for trial they would have to be detained in custody or bound by recognizance ( see section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) below ) . ORG unanimously rejected the applicant \u2019s submissions in respect of the presumption of innocence and the prohibition on discrimination contained in section CARDINAL . By a majority , it found that section CARDINAL violated the right to a fair hearing contained in section CARDINAL .", "The Attorney - General for ORG appealed to ORG of ORG . On DATE , ORG allowed the appeal , holding that section CARDINAL , while unattractive and lacking even - handedness , did not violate the LAW . This unattractiveness was relieved by the fact that the subsection ( CARDINAL ) of the section , allowing the prosecution to claim costs from a convicted defendant , was a dead letter . ORG , relying on this ORG \u2019s rulings in PERSON and PERSON v. the GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and PERSON v. GPE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , found that LAW did not require a discretion to award costs to an acquitted defendant . While an even - handed discretionary power to order reimbursement of costs incurred by a successful prosecutor or a successful defendant would be desirable , it was not correct to find , as ORG had , that such a power was universal among LOC countries . The principle of equality of arms sought to ensure that a defendant did not suffer an unfair procedural disadvantage but did not require that the situations of the prosecutor and defendant should be assimilated and neither applicant had been able to show any procedural disadvantage in the conduct of the trial from the inability to recover his costs . In respect of the presumption of innocence ( and referring to this ORG \u2019s findings in PERSON , cited above ; PERSON v. the GPE , judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL ; and PERSON v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , ORG found that where the domestic court had a discretion to order costs against a prosecutor in favour of an acquitted defendant , the court should not refuse to make such an order in terms which threw doubt on the presumption of innocence . However , where domestic law granted no discretion and did not permit the making of an order , the failure to make such an order could not be rationally understood as throwing doubt on the defendant \u2019s innocence .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( now superseded by LAW ) , in so far as it is relevant , provided as follows :", "\u201c It is hereby recognised and declared that in GPE there have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race , place of origin , political opinions , colour , creed or sex , but subject to respect for the rights and freedoms of others and for the public interest , each and all of the following human rights and fundamental freedoms , namely\u2015", "( a ) the right of the individual to life , liberty , security of the person and the protection of the law ;
