Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , who are NORP nationals , lived in GPE at the material time . Mr PERSON was born in DATE and is a former publishing director of the DATE satirical newspaper ORG encha\u00een\u00e9 . PERSON was born in DATE and is a journalist on ORG encha\u00een\u00e9 .", "CARDINAL . DATE was a period of industrial unrest within the Peugeot motor company . The workforce 's demands included pay rises , which the management , led by the company chairman and managing director Mr PERSON , refused to award .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG encha\u00een\u00e9 published an article by PERSON under the headline :", "\u201c PERSON turbo - charges his salary \u201d", "with the subhead :", "\u201c His tax forms reveal more than he does . The ORG boss has given himself a PERCENT rise over DATE . \u201d", "The article itself included the following :", "\u201c When PERSON appeared on the LAW programme ' ORG in DATE , he refused to answer a question about his pay . This is seen as a public - relations blunder on the part of the ORG boss , but the ORG is now in a position to put it right , thanks to the famous PERSON 's CARDINAL most recent tax - assessment forms , which have come into our hands by chance . At the time of the broadcast , he was earning MONEY net per month .", "These documents show that , DATE , PERSON 's total salary ( plus benefits in kind and sickness benefit ) rose by PERCENT . According to ORG 's own figures , the average pay of the group 's CARDINAL workers rose by PERCENT over DATE in other words , CARDINAL times less than the boss 's .", "PERSON blues", "PERSON has turned ORG around in spectacular style , but in a recent interview on Antenne CARDINAL he said he was under stress due to his group 's position in the face of the NORP offensive . It would appear that this painful psychological crisis has not prevented him from swelling his income \u2013 though it should be noted that PERSON is far from LAW in the hit - parade of chief executives ' salaries .", "In DATE he awarded himself a PERCENT increase in his DATE pay , bringing it to MONEY \u2013 that is , MONEY DATE . Why ? Probably because the Revenue had grabbed a big slice of DATE income . And this dreadful tax - pay spiral continued its destructive course DATE . In DATE , in order to scrape by , PERSON was forced to give himself another rise , of PERCENT . His salary that year came to MONEY , i.e. MONEY DATE after deductions ... \u201d", "The article was illustrated by a box reproducing a photocopy of that part of each of the CARDINAL notices of assessment to tax which detailed Mr PERSON 's \u201c total taxable income \u201d and showed the amounts he had received by way of \u201c salary , benefits in kind and sickness benefit \u201d . Each of the CARDINAL totals was circled in pencil .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON lodged a criminal complaint against a person or persons unknown , together with an application to join the proceedings as a civil party claiming damages , with the senior investigating judge at GPE tribunal de grande instance . He submitted that the events in question must have involved the unlawful removal and possession of the originals or copies of documents normally held by the tax authorities and amounted to the offences of misappropriation of deeds or documents by a public servant , breach of professional confidence , misappropriation of documents for the time needed to reproduce them and handling unlawfully obtained documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor applied to the investigating judge for an investigation to be opened into allegations of theft , breach of professional confidence , unlawful removal of deeds or documents by a public servant and handling unlawfully obtained goods .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for the ORG also lodged a criminal complaint , together with an application to join the proceedings as a civil party claiming damages , against a person or persons unknown for unlawful removal of government documents and breach of professional confidence . On DATE the public prosecutor requested that a further investigation be opened .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the investigation , an analysis of the computer reference number on the copy documents in Mr PERSON 's possession revealed that they were photocopies of the part of the tax - assessment notice which is kept by the tax authorities and is not intended to leave their LOC . An inspection of the LOC confirmed that the locks on the cabinets containing the documents had not been forced and that the alarm protecting the LOC outside TIME had not been activated .", "An examination of the original of Mr PERSON 's tax assessment for DATE revealed a palm - print belonging to the ORG Director of Taxes . However , it was asserted that this person had called up the relevant tax file on DATE at the request of the Head of the Revenue and the Director of Taxes for the d\u00e9partement . The person or persons responsible for unlawfully removing the document from the tax authorities ' premises could not be identified , with the result that no one was ever charged under that head .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were charged with handling copies of notices of assessment to tax obtained through a breach of professional confidence , unlawful removal of deeds or documents and theft .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor filed a report recommending that no one should be charged with the offences of theft or breach of professional confidence , that all the charges against the first applicant should be dropped and that the second applicant should be committed for trial before ORG on charges of handling photocopies of Mr PERSON 's tax assessments obtained through a breach of professional confidence by an unidentified tax official .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge ordered that , as no culprit had been identified , the proceedings for theft and breach of professional confidence should be discontinued . The judge committed both applicants for trial before ORG on charges of handling confidential information concerning Mr PERSON 's income obtained through a breach of professional confidence by an unidentified tax official and of handling stolen photocopies of Mr PERSON 's tax assessments .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted CARDINAL arguments in their defence : first , that the conditions for publishing directors to be criminally liable , laid down in CARDINAL of the Freedom of LAW of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) did not apply and , second , that the elements of the offences with which they had been charged , as defined in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , were not made out in their case .", "CARDINAL . At the trial Mr PERSON stated that the first time he had seen the extracts from the tax assessments printed in the newspaper was when he looked at the proofs before personally passing the article for press . He said he had asked PERSON \u201c whether his documents were sound in journalistic terms \u201d , that is to say , \u201c whether the information was accurate and had been checked \u201d . He acknowledged that , as a general rule , passing copy for press was the responsibility of an editorial assistant , who , \u201c if there is a problem , consults the editor and , in the last resort , the publishing director \u201d .", "The second applicant stated that the photocopies of the tax assessments had been sent anonymously in an envelope addressed to him by name , DATE before they were used in the paper . He explained that he had \u201c checked the plausibility \u201d of the information in the documents , in particular by looking up the level of Mr PERSON 's remuneration in specialist works including ORG . He said that he had also checked with various persons to ensure that the documents were photocopies of \u201c genuine \u201d tax - assessment notices . He specified that he had also verified that they really were tax - authority documents , adding that once it appeared that there was no proof that they had been obtained unlawfully , \u201c the overriding consideration was the documents ' significance \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG acquitted the applicants , holding that the principal offences of theft and breach of professional confidence had not been made out because it had proved impossible to identify who had disclosed the documents or to establish the circumstances in which the offences had been committed .", "In relation to the offence of breach of professional confidence , the court held as follows :", "\u201c ...", "In the instant case , while it has been established that the originals of the documents in question are notices of assessment to tax held on Mr PERSON 's tax file , it can not be inferred from this that the person guilty of wrongfully taking them for the time needed to photocopy them , or of disclosing them to third parties , or of divulging the information contained in them , necessarily fell within CARDINAL of the categories of person defined in the above - mentioned provision [ Article PERSON of LAW ] ; since the tax authorities themselves have suggested that the perpetrator might be ' someone from outside ' ... \u2013 whatever the security regulations at the time .", "The fact that the status and professional functions of the person responsible for the disclosure are unknown therefore rules out any possibility of proving one of the essential elements of the offence of breach of professional confidence .", "Consequently , there is no formal proof that this offence was committed , so that the charge against the defendants of handling the fruits of a breach of professional confidence has not been made out ... \u201d", "In relation to the theft charge , the court held :", "\u201c ... In particular , it has not been shown that the person who originally copied the documents had any unlawful intention or had such an intention at the time of taking the documents .", "Hence , without further rehearsing the numerous questions remaining unanswered concerning how these documents found their way into PERSON hands , we find that the elements of the offence of theft have not been sufficiently proved .", "Unless it can be precisely established that , in the first place , an act defined as a serious crime ( crime ) or other major offence ( d\u00e9lit ) was committed , and its elements can be made out , the prerequisite for an offence of handling is lacking , and the defendant must be acquitted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively , the public prosecutor and the civil parties claiming damages appealed .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG reversed the judgment and found the applicants guilty of handling photocopies of Mr PERSON 's tax returns obtained through a breach of professional confidence by an unidentified tax official . Mr PERSON and PERSON were sentenced to , respectively , fines of MONEY ( ORG ) and ordered , jointly and severally , to pay Mr PERSON CARDINAL by way of damages for non - pecuniary damage and FRF CARDINAL by way of reimbursement of legal costs under LAW .", "ORG held as follows :", "\u201c This ORG can not agree with the manner in which the court below analysed the facts . The results of the investigations show that only a tax official familiar with the department could have leaked the documents , since no outside party had requested PERSON file and that file was found , on TIME CARDINAL DATE , in its normal condition , with the documents filed according to the particular practice of ORG . It is certain that CARDINAL party , someone who was not a civil servant or was from outside the tax department , could not \u2013 without attracting attention \u2013 have taken documents filed in CARDINAL separate places in the file , photographed or photocopied them and put them back in exactly the right place , given that the file is kept in a metal cabinet in a locked room to which there is access only for authorised persons .", "Contrary to the court below , we therefore hold that , in this case , it has been established that the offence of breach of professional confidence was committed , and that the fact that the culprit has not been identified is irrelevant .", "PERSON told the investigating judge that the photocopies of PERSON tax notices were sent to him anonymously at the newspaper , in an envelope addressed to him personally . He confirmed that he had questioned various people in order to ensure that they were indeed copies of genuine tax documents .", "PERSON article , containing a reproduction of the documents in question , was submitted to PERSON , the publishing director of ORG encha\u00een\u00e9 , who , personally , passed it for press .", "PERSON told the investigating judge that he saw the extracts from PERSON tax notices at that point . He explained that DATE as a general rule \u2013 copy is passed for press by the senior editorial assistant , who , if there is a problem , consults the editor and , in the last resort , himself .", "The offence of handling the fruits of a breach of professional confidence was characterised , in the instant case , by the publication of documents obtained in breach of the provisions of LAW and was committed by PERSON and PERSON given that , in the light of the nature of the documents and of the checks which PERSON says he carried out , the defendants must have known that those documents came from a tax file . Moreover , this explains why the article was passed for press by PERSON , the publishing director , and not an editorial assistant or the editor . It is worth recalling that , although Mr PERSON was not the person to whom the documents were sent , he saw them before giving his authorisation to publish the article reproducing extracts from them . Therefore , both the actus reus and the mens rea of the offence of handling the fruits of a breach of professional confidence are present in his case as well as in that of the author of the article , PERSON ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON and PERSON appealed to ORG on points of law . In their grounds of appeal ( and subsequently in a reply to Mr PERSON 's pleadings ) , they submitted CARDINAL arguments .", "As the first ground of appeal , PERSON argued that , since he was a publishing director as defined in the LAW of DATE , the lower courts ORG were not empowered to convict him of a handling offence under the general criminal law , but only of CARDINAL of the offences specially defined in that LAW . In his reply , he pointed out that the other side was confusing \u201c handling \u201d with \u201c publishing \u201d , submitting that Mr PERSON was concerned , not by the handling but by the publication \u2013 something which did not contravene any provision of the press laws , so that the prosecution had resorted to another , inappropriate , charge , that of handling .", "As the second ground , both applicants argued that the elements of the offence with which they had been charged , as defined in the relevant domestic law , including sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of LAW , were not made out in their case . On that point , they maintained that Mr PERSON 's tax assessments were not covered by a duty to preserve confidentiality \u2013 so that there could have been no breach of such a duty \u2013 but contained information which was available to the public . They argued that a journalist could not lawfully be convicted of \u201c handling information \u201d and submitted that ORG had failed to demonstrate how the actus reus and mens rea of the offence with which they had been charged DATE namely possession or control of the thing in question and knowledge that it had been obtained unlawfully DATE were made out in their case . With regard to the fact that ORG had deduced that PERSON must have known that the documents had been obtained unlawfully since , when he had received them , he had verified that they were indeed copies of tax assessments , PERSON submitted that he had \u201c merely fulfilled his duty as a journalist : before publishing information , he had checked that it was genuine , as required by the obligation on all journalists to exercise caution and verify sources \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE , holding as follows :", "\u201c ...", "The grounds [ of ORG judgment ] , following as they do from findings of fact which are not subject to review by ORG , show that the appellate court , having established that the defendants knowingly had in their possession or control documents obtained through a breach of professional confidence , contrary to LAW , did not misdirect themselves in law as alleged [ by the appellants ] .", "In particular , ORG can not be held to have misinterpreted LAW as it stood at the time , in which the only offence defined is that of handling stolen goods , since , although it found the applicants guilty of handling unlawfully obtained photocopies , it rightly dismissed the charge of handling unlawfully obtained information on which the journalists were committed for trial before FAC .", "Information , whatever its nature or source , is covered neither by LAW nor by LAW which came into force on DATE , so that , if a problem arose \u2013 that is , if certain information were published and that publication were challenged by the persons concerned \u2013 the only legal provisions governing it would be those specifically concerning the freedom of the press or of audiovisual communication ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
