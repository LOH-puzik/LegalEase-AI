THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On CARDINAL DATE a warrant to search the applicant \u2019s home was granted by justices sitting at ORG under , inter alia , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE . The warrant authorised a search for cannabis and associated drug paraphernalia . It was granted on the basis of an ORG dated DATE , sworn by police constable PERSON , which set out the following grounds for the application :", "\u201c In DATE , the police were contacted by an anonymous male stating that they had witnessed various persons visiting the target address at all times of DATE , both on foot and in vehicles . These persons were unknown to the source but only visited the target LOC for a matter of TIME before leaving . It has been stated that the LOC were involved in the supply of cannabis .", "The source has since contacted the police and confirmed that the activity is constant .", "This same unregistered source has contacted the police on several occasions and has supplied reliable information .", "Enquiries with the council reveal that [ the applicant ] is the tenant of the semi - detached property and they have also received complaints in relation to vehicles visiting the address in DATE by local residents .", "The vehicles , which are visiting the address on a regular basis , are used by the local drug fraternity who have previous criminal convictions for possession of cannabis . \u201d", "The Information went on to outline why alternative methods of enquiry were considered unsuitable and why the search was necessary . It stated :", "\u201c A search warrant is considered to be a proportionate response \u201d .", "The warrant was executed on DATE . CARDINAL police officers searched the applicant \u2019s home for TIME , during which time the applicant and his wife were present . No items were found and no further action was taken against the applicant .", "The applicant issued judicial review proceedings in DATE , alleging that the failure of the justices to give reasons for their decision or to make a record of the hearing at which the warrant was granted meant that there were no adequate or effective safeguards against abuse of the warrant procedure . He submitted that the information supplied to the justices was ambiguous and inconsistent ; for example because the \u201c anonymous \u201d male was also a \u201c source \u201d known to the police , and because the statement that the premises were involved in the supply of cannabis was merely an unattributed assertion . Moreover , the source of the statement about the use of the vehicles by the local \u201c drug fraternity \u201d was unclear .", "Permission to apply for judicial review was granted on DATE . Witness statements were served from the police officer , the CARDINAL lay magistrates and the legal adviser who were at the hearing on DATE . The police officer made CARDINAL statements , the second of which outlined police concerns that , as applications for warrants were often based on confidential information , recording of the evidence or the justices\u2019 reasons at the hearing of an application for a warrant could have a severe impact on police effectiveness . As to the particular application , the officer recalled being asked various questions by the justices about the vehicles mentioned in the ORG and the geographical layout of the area .", "The legal adviser to the justices , although unable to remember the specific case , gave details in his statement of his \u201c invariable practice \u201d when dealing with applications for warrants . In particular , he stated that he would draw the ORG attention to the relevant statutory requirements and if any matters arose during the application which did not appear within the body of the ORG , he would direct the justices to endorse those matters on the Information . In general , he asserted that the ORG itself became the written record of evidence , together with any additional comments noted as a result of the justices\u2019 questions to the constable . Taking a full note of the evidence would therefore simply be to restate the facts already set out in the ORG and serve no useful purpose .", "In ORG judgment on DATE , the Lord Chief Justice , dismissing the application and endorsing the views of the legal adviser to the justices , said :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The evidence that exists in this case , as it seems to me , shows that the safeguards which the statute rightly requires and which article CARDINAL makes necessary , which would also be required in the appropriate circumstances by article CARDINAL , were fully complied with . In considering compliance with article CARDINAL and article CARDINAL the facts of the particular case will in the end always be decisive . When justices accept an information as containing all the material upon which they rely as satisfying them ... it is unreasonable to require them to make a note . If a particular matter is elicited in the course of questioning the deponent who is seeking the warrant , then ... it would be desirable to make a note of that matter , not only for the benefit of any subsequent citizen who wished to challenge the legality of the warrant , but also to protect the justices and police from unwarranted allegations . \u201d", "The Lord Chief Justice went on to say that , in the applicant \u2019s case :", "\u201c The material upon which the warrant was issued is clearly contained in the information and the basis on which the warrant was issued is obvious without any need for the justice merely to repeat that he is satisfied as required by LAW . To require the justice to set out that he was so satisfied would serve no purpose whatsoever . \u201d", "ORG referred with approval to the prescribed form in which ORG was contained , noting that it appeared to have been carefully drafted with Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW in mind . The court concluded that , whilst an exceptional case would have to be considered on its merits , in the ordinary case it would be unreasonable to require anything additional to the ORG itself , which the person affected ought to be able to obtain . The court refused permission to appeal , as did ORG itself on DATE .", "Section CARDINAL of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act CARDINAL ( \u201c PACE \u201d ) provides :", "\u201c Search warrants - safeguards .
