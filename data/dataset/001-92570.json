Of CARDINAL hearings scheduled between CARDINAL DATE and DATE , none was rescheduled on the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . Sixteen hearings fixed between CARDINAL DATE and DATE were adjourned because of incorrect service of the court summons , late exchange of applications by the parties , belated submissions or the failure of the national authorities and the parties to respond to court orders in time . A hearing fixed for CARDINAL DATE was postponed due to the applicant \u2019s absence for work - related reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the plaintiffs\u2019 claim and recognised their title to the property . It rescinded the DATE gift and declared that PERSON had the title to CARDINAL of the property . The court established that Mr PERSON had tenancy of the property since DATE and that the plaintiffs had authorised the defendants to buy the property under the condition of caring for them and living under the same roof . As the applicant had divorced her husband and ceased to live with the plaintiffs , the court held that the right to buy the apartment remained groundless and considered it as if it had not been established .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted an appeal by the applicant and remitted the case for a fresh consideration . It established that the lower court had not given sufficient reasons for its decision . It further ordered a stay of the proceedings pending assessment of the validity of the sale agreement of DATE , the subject of other proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG granted Mr ORG \u2019s action and annulled the DATE gift . It further ordered their daughters to restore the property into Mr PERSON \u2019s possession . Lastly , it ordered the applicant not to dispose of the property . The court established that the applicant had made the DATE gift while the proceedings regarding the DATE gift had been pending on appeal . It ruled that the applicant accordingly had known or ought to have known that she could not make the DATE gift while the proceedings in respect of the DATE gift were pending . It dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection that her lawyer had not been provided with explicit authority to represent PERSON In this respect , it held that the applicant had been her daughters\u2019 statutory guardian and they all acted as a single party to the proceedings .

On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision concerning the annulment order and injunction .
