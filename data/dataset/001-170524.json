On DATE the above - mentioned complaints were communicated to the Government .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were born in what is now GPE in GPE . The first applicant moved to GPE in DATE and has lived there ever since , on the basis of regularly renewed residence permits . In DATE he was granted a permanent residence permit , which was renewed in DATE and DATE . The second applicant moved to GPE in DATE and has lived there subsequently , on the basis of regularly renewed residence permits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP Minister of Interior adopted decisions to include the applicants in the list of aliens prohibited from entering and remaining in GPE and GPE ( hereinafter \u201c the blacklist \u201d ) for an indeterminate period of time .

The ORG had informed the Minister of ORG that both applicants had been engaging in criminal activity and planning to commit a serious crime , and hence posed a threat to national security and public order and safety . The part relating to national security grounds was identical in both decisions and stated :", "\u201c The ORG indicated that the information obtained attests to [ the applicant \u2019s ] criminal activity in a leading role within an organised criminal group . Similarly , it is apparent from the information provided by the ORG that [ the applicant ] is planning to commit a serious or especially serious crime which may have irreversible consequences on national security . As a consequence [ the applicant ] in his activity [ is ] a threat to public order and national security . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants were not made aware of the ORG \u2019s report .", "CARDINAL . The decision concerning the first applicant pointed to the fact that he was married to a NORP national . It was therefore concluded that he would not encounter any obstacles in meeting his spouse outside GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the decision concerning the second applicant it was noted that he was married to a NORP national . His former wife ( a NORP national ) and their minor child were also residing in GPE . The decision went on to state that an interference with the second applicant \u2019s right to respect for his private and family life was justified , taking into account , among other things , that during DATE he had resided in GPE \u201c he had not learned the [ State language ] , which [ had ] clearly obstructed his integration into society \u201d . It was also pointed out that he had moved to GPE when he was over DATE , which meant that his ties to his native country had not disappeared . With regard to him having an opportunity to meet his young son , the decision stated that he had already agreed in DATE , while still residing in GPE , that the child would reside with his mother in GPE . It was therefore concluded that he \u201c would not be entirely deprived of opportunities to meet [ his ] son \u201d in GPE .

On DATE the applicants , through their legal representative , applied to ORG of the ORG of ORG to challenge the Minister of ORG \u2019s decision to put their names on the blacklist . On CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the ORG refused to accept the applicants\u2019 complaints for lack of jurisdiction , indicating that such reviews fell within the competence of the Prosecutor General if the decision had been adopted \u201c on the basis of information obtained as a result of intelligence or counterintelligence \u201d .

On CARDINAL occasions the appeals were amended to include , inter alia , the allegations that in DATE the applicants had collaborated with the NORP State security services in a hostage liberation operation in GPE . Later the appeal was amended to include the second applicant \u2019s allegation that subsequently he had refused to cooperate with a ORG officer in relation to certain activities of the leaders of the NORP community in GPE , and therefore the expulsion had been instigated in revenge for that .", "CARDINAL . In a reply of DATE ORG dismissed the request for access to the requested documents . He noted that the possibility to familiarise oneself with information containing ORG secrets , if necessary with the assistance of specially authorised representatives , as provided in CARDINAL of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , applied only to administrative court proceedings . ORG in his reply also stated :", "\u201c ... By envisaging in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW that an appeal against a decision the Minister of Interior adopted on the basis of information obtained in the course of intelligence or counterintelligence activities carried out by a ORG security institution could be lodged with the Prosecutor General [ but ] not a court , the legislator wished especially to protect information obtained in the course of intelligence or counterintelligence activities ; [ granting ] access to such information to persons not possessing special permission ... could seriously infringe the work of the ORG security institutions ... thus seriously impairing national security . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of DATE the Prosecutor General reformulated the Minister of ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

The condition set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) has therefore been established , which serves as a basis for the adopted decision to include [ the applicant ] in the list of aliens prohibited from entering GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor General also dismissed the applicants\u2019 fear that they could be exposed to ill - treatment in GPE due to their alleged involvement in the hostage liberation in DATE , as that involvement remained unconfirmed . In particular , the witnesses questioned had provided controversial submissions , which did not correspond to the testimony of other witnesses , including the statements obtained from the hostages liberated during the operation . In examining the allegations about the risk of ill - treatment after expulsion , the information ORG had obtained from ORG and the applicants\u2019 relatives confirmed that on numerous occasions DATE the applicants had entered GPE , including GPE .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the complaint of unlawful activity by a ORG officer , ORG noted that the meeting between the ORG officer and the second applicant had been recorded in accordance with the law , and that the second applicant \u2019s allegations were ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , in the light of the Prosecutor General \u2019s decision to reformulate the basis on which the ORG names had been put on the blacklist , on DATE their legal representative wrote to the Minister of ORG and director of the ORG asking for a review of the decisions to include them in the list .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG representative received a response from the director of the ORG , stating that his request of CARDINAL DATE did not refer to any new circumstances which could serve as a basis for amending or revoking their report to the Minister of Interior in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE the Minister of ORG gave a similar reply to the ORG representative .", "CARDINAL . In a letter sent to ORG DATE the ORG representative brought to the ORG \u2019s attention the following :", "\u201c ... [ I]n DATE the applicants were informed that in an unofficial conversation with a certain high - ranking police officer , [ a staff member of the ORG ] had stipulated that he would \u201c take care \u201d of any potential complaints the applicants might submit to the ORG , and certain politicians would make sure the complaints were not successful . ... The applicants considered this information irrelevant before the above mentioned official information [ the ORG \u2019s letter ] was received . \u201d", "They further drew the ORG \u2019s attention to CARDINAL questions , the first being how the ORG became aware of their application to the ORG , and the second how the application influenced the decisions of the ORG and Minister of Interior .", "CARDINAL . The authorities apprehended the first and second applicants on CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively . They were both placed in a ORG temporary detention facility . The first applicant met CARDINAL of his lawyers on DATE of his detention , and the other one the following day . The second applicant met his lawyer on DATE of his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the acting chief of the GPE branch of ORG adopted decisions to expel the applicants from GPE and to deport them to GPE . The reason was that the applicants constituted a threat to national security , public order or safety under section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL part CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The decisions indicated that it was possible to lodge an appeal without suspensive effect to the chief of ORG . On DATE both applicants were made aware of the respective decisions . They both appealed ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On TIME the applicants were taken to the NORP border and expelled from GPE .", "CARDINAL . That afternoon one of the legal representatives sent a fax to , inter alia , ORG , asking the applicants not to be expelled to GPE \u201c because they are possibly agents of ORG and their expulsion to the receiving ORG puts them under threat and they could be subjected to torture \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG initial submissions to the ORG , \u201c DATE after their expulsion to the GPE \u201d they were summoned by NORP police and were questioned about their role in the hostage liberation operation in DATE before being beaten up . The case file contains an identical certificate for each applicant issued by a NORP hospital , confirming that on DATE both applicants had been found to have concussion , a brain injury and multiple bruises and scratches . The applicants alleged that as a result of what had happened they had had to flee GPE and were now hiding in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 representative submitted appeals against the expulsion orders of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , complaining , inter alia , of the authorities\u2019 failure to strike a fair balance between the right to respect for their family life and the alleged threat to national security , as required under LAW . The chief of ORG dismissed the first and second applicant \u2019s complaints on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . In their appeal to ORG of DATE the applicants also said that before adopting the impugned decision ORG had not heard them , meaning they had not been able to provide information on the possible threat they would face at the hands of the security services after their expulsion to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in CARDINAL judgments , upheld the impugned decisions in relation to both applicants . ORG established that prior to expulsion the applicants had not approached the NORP authorities with allegations concerning the risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW if expelled to GPE . It also noted that on DATE both applicants were informed that the expulsion would be carried out the following day , on DATE . On DATE of the applicants submitted a request to the chief of ORG asking to be given several impounded goods in custody , but no other requests were made . Both applicants met their lawyers after being detained .", "CARDINAL . The court referred to its well - established case - law and noted that the decisions to put the applicants\u2019 names on the blacklist on national security grounds had been reviewed and upheld by ORG , so neither ORG nor the administrative court were competent to review the Minister of ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . By addressing the complaint that in adopting the impugned expulsion decision of CARDINAL DATE the applicants were not heard , the court noted that even if it constituted a minor procedural shortcoming , the lack of hearing of the applicants and witnesses could not have an effect on the outcome of the case . In particular , the court noted that the review of the Minister of ORG \u2019s decision fell outside the scope of the present administrative proceedings . Any information the applicants might have submitted in relation to the adoption of the above decision could not have any effect on the content of the contested decision of CARDINAL DATE to expel the applicants . Moreover , the applicants were not prevented , with the assistance of their legal representatives , from communicating to ORG any information regarding the alleged interference the impugned decision would have on their family life .", "CARDINAL . The judgments also stated that there were no obstacles for the applicants to enjoy their family life in GPE . Nor were there any special circumstances to the effect that the family members could not join them outside GPE . The wife of the first applicant was a NORP national and she would not have any restrictions to travel to GPE , whereas the second applicant would not encounter any obstacles in meeting outside GPE his child whose mother was a NORP national .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( in relation to the first applicant ) and on DATE ( in relation to the second applicant ) ORG of the ORG of ORG refused to initiate cassation proceedings . The ORG stated , in particular , that the contested expulsion orders were a final stage in the proceedings initiated by the decisions of the Minister of ORG . The ORG further noted that it had been made aware of the decisions of the Minister of ORG and the letters of ORG on which the decision was based , and of the decisions of ORG Review of the above decisions fell outside the scope of the present proceedings , but these decisions attested to the lawful basis and legitimate aim of the applicants\u2019 expulsion .", "CARDINAL . On the question of the proportionality of the interference with the applicants\u2019 family lives , the ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s findings and noted that the applicants had not advanced any arguments indicating any restrictions to enjoy their family life outside GPE . In relation to the second applicant , the ORG noted that in DATE , while still residing in GPE , he had agreed that the child would reside with the applicant \u2019s former wife , a NORP national , in GPE . The ORG also stated that both applicants had entered GPE as adults and throughout their stay in GPE they had not learned NORP , which showed that their ties with the expelling ORG were not strong .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the acting director of ORG decided to withdraw the first applicant \u2019s residence permit and refused to grant the second applicant a temporary residence permit because of their inclusion in the blacklist .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 legal representative lodged appeals against the above - mentioned decisions on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE respectively . CARDINAL levels of administrative courts dismissed the complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG of the ORG of ORG refused to initiate cassation proceedings in relation to the second applicant . The ORG noted , in particular , that the authorities had concluded that the applicant posed a threat to national security , and that depriving him of residence permit served a legitimate aim . The ORG also did not see any reasons why the applicant could not meet his minor child outside the territory of GPE , especially in the circumstances where already in DATE , while still residing in GPE , the applicant had agreed that the child would reside with his mother in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The cassation complaint submitted by the first applicant is pending examination before the ORG .", "CARDINAL .
