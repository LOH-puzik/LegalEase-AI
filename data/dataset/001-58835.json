THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - claim dismissed", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , an NORP , appeared together with PERSON and PERSON before ORG , composed of a judge and a jury , to be tried for conspiracy to defraud .", "CARDINAL . After the defence had stated its case , the judge started his summingup , which he had almost completed by DATE TIME when he adjourned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE TIME a juror arrived at the court and handed an envelope to the court usher containing the following complaint :", "\u201c I have decided I can not remain silent any longer . For some time during the trial I have been concerned that fellow jurors are not taking their duties seriously . CARDINAL have been making openly racist remarks and jokes and I fear are going to convict the defendants not on the evidence but because they are NORP . My concern is the defendants will not therefore receive a fair verdict . Please could you advise me what I can do in this situation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The juror who had written the complaint was asked not to join the other jurors . The judge discussed the complaint with counsel in chambers and then adjourned and listened to submissions in open court . The defence asked the judge to dismiss the jury on the ground that there was a real danger of bias . The judge , however , decided to call the jury back into court , at which stage the juror who had written the complaint joined the others . The judge read out the complaint to them and told them the following :", "\u201c Members of the jury , TIME I received a note from CARDINAL of your number expressing extreme concern that some of your number are not taking your duties seriously , are making openly racist remarks and jokes about NORP and may not reach your verdicts upon the evidence but because of some racial prejudice .", "I am not able to conduct an inquiry into the validity of those contentions and I do not propose to do so . This case has cost an enormous amount of money and I am not anxious to halt it at the moment , but I shall have no compunction in doing so if the situation demands .", "When you took the oath or affirmed as jurors it was , you will remember , to bring in true verdicts according to the evidence . That is solemn and binding and means what it says .", "I am going to adjourn now and I am going to ask you all to search your conscience TIME and if you feel that you are not able to try this case solely on the evidence and find that you can not put aside any prejudices you may have will you please indicate that fact by writing a personal note to that effect and giving it to the jury bailiff on your arrival at court TIME . I will then review the position . Thank you very much . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The next morning the judge received CARDINAL letters from the jury . The first letter , which was signed by all the jurors including the juror who had sent the complaint , stated the following :", "\u201c We , the undersigned members of the jury , wish to put on record to the ORG our response to DATE 's note from a juror implying possible racial bias .", "CARDINAL . We utterly refute the allegation .", "CARDINAL . We are deeply offended by the allegation .", "CARDINAL . We assure the ORG that we intend to reach a verdict solely according to the evidence and without racial bias . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second letter , which the judge commended , was written by a juror who appeared to have thought himself to have been the one who had been making the jokes . The juror in question explained at length that he might have done so , that he was sorry if he had given any offence , that he was somebody who had many connections with people from ethnic minorities and that he was in no way racially biased .", "CARDINAL . The judge decided that he would not discharge the jury and told them the following :", "\u201c Ladies and gentlemen , the events of DATE TIME were clearly distressing for you , but I am sure you will see and realise that when a judge receives a note from CARDINAL of your number raising those sort of issues it is the judge 's duty to bring it to the attention of the whole jury .", "Whether the suggestions were well or ill - founded is not something I or any judge can decide , nor is it something that can be investigated by the judge . It would be an improper activity . I took the course I did in the exercise of my discretion and I am sorry you were offended and upset .", "However , CARDINAL of you have TIME utterly refuted the allegation , expressed your deep offence at it and assured the ORG that you intend to reach a verdict or verdicts solely according to the evidence and without racial bias . CARDINAL of your number has also written at length a most cogent and balanced letter , and it is quite clear to me that each and every one of you are conscious of the oath or affirmation that you have taken and are dutifully prepared to abide by . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the jury found the applicant guilty , but acquitted PERSON , who was also NORP . On DATE the judge imposed on the applicant a sentence of DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was given leave to appeal against conviction . In his appeal he raised , inter alia , the following ground : The judge should have reacted to the juror 's complaint by dismissing the jury ; in any event , the juror who had written the complaint should not have been segregated from the other members of the jury in the early stages and the judge should not have disclosed to the jurors the contents of the complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . As regards the above - mentioned ground it considered the following : The court had regard to the letter signed by all the members of the jury , and the letter of the juror who was probably responsible for the remarks that had given offence , and found that the trial judge did not err in reaching the conclusion that there was no real risk of bias . Moreover , the judge was right to confront the jury with the problem and ask them to consider it . It was perhaps unfortunate that the juror who had written the complaint was for a time segregated from the other members of the jury , as this led to his identification . However , it would be unrealistic to suppose that the jury would not have wanted to know who the author of the complaint was and the judge dealt with the possibility of tensions among the jurors perfectly sensibly in the direction he gave to them ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
