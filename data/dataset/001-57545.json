To say that the medical doctor , who admits or receives the child into the hospital , by complying with the request of the holder of the parental rights , has made a decision which the child itself may request to be reviewed in court would be meaningless , as indirectly it would constitute an interference with the statutory right of the holder of the parental rights to make decisions , within the limits of the law , on the personal life of the child .
