The applicant was born in DATE and lives in the village of Nemcha in the Kursk region .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is an agronomist . When collective farms were being privatised , he left the ORG collective farm in LOC , LOC , and became head of a private farm \u201c LOC \u201d ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) . In DATE , by decisions of the Head of ORG of GPE , GPE was granted CARDINAL plots of agricultural land DATE hectares from the lands of the former ORG collective farm and CARDINAL hectares from a special State land fund . As the applicant considered himself the sole owner of the land and the other CARDINAL partners in ORG disagreed with his position , disputes began between them . ORG has been involved in various court proceedings since DATE and the land has not been farmed since that time .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of DATE ORG of GPE pointed out violations of law in the setting up and registering of ORG and suggested that ORG of the Kursk region ( \u201c the FAC \u201d ) should take steps to remedy the situation . On DATE the Head of ORG no . CARDINAL whereby , inter alia , ORG no . DATE , drawn up in the name of PERSON V.A. Zhigalev , was annulled as having been issued in breach of the law and the rights of the other partners in ORG . Resolution no . CARDINAL of DATE , issued by the Head of ORG ( by which ORG was registered and on which Mr V.A. ORG was named as head of ORG ) was supplemented with a list of CARDINAL partners in ORG , comprising PERSON A.V. Gerasimov , PERSON S.V. ORG , PERSON N.N. Belov , PERSON A.N. Kazyulkin and PERSON PERSON ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG Acting as head of ORG , Mr GPE brought proceedings on behalf of the farm , seeking to have ORG no . CARDINAL declared invalid . The proceedings ended with a decision by ORG of ORG of DATE granting ORG action , on the ground that the Head of ORG had had no jurisdiction to make such decisions , which could only be made by a court with regard to annulment of the land certificate , and on the basis of the relevant documents , adopted by the farm , with regard to including the list of its partners in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an application by the Head of ORG , an investigator from ORG initiated criminal proceedings , having detected that CARDINAL copies of a Land Certificate concerning ORG land DATE one issued to Mr Zhigalev by ORG and ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and the other one held by ORG , which ought to have been signed by the former Head of ORG , bore the signatures of CARDINAL different persons .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the investigation , it was established that , on the basis of ORG no . CARDINAL on the allocation of land to ORG , issued by the Head of ORG on DATE , Mr PERSON , former Chairman of ORG , had prepared ORG no . DATE concerning a plot of QUANTITY of land . The investigator found that , as a result of negligent performance of his duties , Mr Kolkov had failed to specify in ORG that the land had been allotted to ORG , and not to ORG alone . He had also failed to register this Land Certificate with ORG .", "CARDINAL . Later , on the basis of ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE on amendment of the above ORG no . CARDINAL , issued by the Head of ORG , PERSON PERSON had prepared ORG , no . DATE , concerning the same CARDINAL.CARDINAL-hectare plot and a plot of QUANTITY . It had been properly registered in the relevant records of ORG as no . CARDINAL . The investigator found that , as a result of negligent performance of his duties , PERSON PERSON had again failed to specify in this Land Certificate that the land had been allotted to ORG , including all its partners , and not to ORG alone . Another oversight was that ORG contained no reference to ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE , on the basis of which it had been issued . Furthermore , an original copy of the ORG belonging to ORG had been lost , and there remained CARDINAL copy , that issued to ORG . Mr PERSON had then prepared another unnumbered ORG , identical to ORG no . DATE save that it was issued in the name of ORG . This had been kept in ORG archives . The investigator found that ORG was unlawful , in that it had not been signed by ORG and did not bear ORG official stamp .", "CARDINAL . According to statements by PERSON Kolkov , he had considered that , by drawing up ORG in Mr Zhigalev \u2019s name , he had actually issued them to ORG inasmuch as ORG had been head of the farm .", "CARDINAL . In his decision of CARDINAL DATE , the investigator held that PERSON PERSON \u2019s actions contained elements of negligence punishable under LAW . However , as the DATE limitation period applicable to this offence , committed in DATE , had expired , the prosecution was time - barred . The proceedings were therefore terminated . On DATE a copy of the decision was served on Mr Zhigalev .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Zhigalev , head of ORG , decided that PERSON A.N. Kazyulkin and PERSON S.V. ORG were to be dismissed from ORG . On DATE the same decision was taken in respect of Mr GPE Gerasimov . The farmers challenged the lawfulness of their dismissal in court .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of the LOC established that the above - named individuals had always been partners in ORG and not its hired workers . Accordingly , the court held that ORG had had no authority to dismiss them .", "CARDINAL . Acting as head of ORG , Mr GPE brought proceedings against ORG on behalf of the farm , seeking compensation in connection with the adoption of Resolutions nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of DATE and ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE . Mr ORG alleged that the adoption of those Resolutions had prevented cultivation of the land . He claimed compensation for expenses which the farm would necessarily incur in remedying the situation , and for loss of profit .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of the Kursk Region established the facts of the case as follows .", "CARDINAL . By Resolution no . CARDINAL of DATE , issued by the Head of ORG , ORG had been granted a plot of QUANTITY from the lands of the former ORG collective farm and a plot of CARDINAL hectares in lease for DATE . By the same Resolution V.A. ORG had been confirmed as head of ORG and GPE GPE , GPE ORG , ORG , ORG and PERSON ORG as partners in ORG .", "CARDINAL . By Resolution no . CARDINAL of DATE , issued by the Head of ORG , ORG had been registered as a legal entity .", "CARDINAL . Land Certificate no . DATE had been issued to ORG in pursuance of the above ORG for the founding of ORG .", "CARDINAL . By Resolution no . CARDINAL of DATE , issued by the Head of ORG , the earlier ORG no . CARDINAL had been amended in order to specify the size of the plot of land given in life - time inheritable possession to each partner in the farm .", "CARDINAL . Resolution no . CARDINAL of DATE , issued by the Head of ORG , had concerned the renaming of ORG as GPE farm by its partners and their re - election of the farm \u2019s head following a vote of no confidence to ORG . It had also ordered ORG to annul ORG issued to ORG and to prepare new documents accordingly . By ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE , issued by the Head of ORG , ORG had been re - registered as ORG . Resolutions nos . QUANTITY and CARDINAL had then been reversed by the Head of ORG , and , when the court delivered its judgment on DATE , Resolutions nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of DATE were in force in their earlier version .", "CARDINAL . By Resolution no . CARDINAL of DATE , issued by the Head of ORG , ORG no . DATE was annulled and ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE had been made more precise in respect of the partners in the farm . By a decision of ORG of ORG of DATE , ORG no . CARDINAL had been declared null and void .", "CARDINAL . Having examined the evidence in the case , ORG of GPE found that there was no single document from which it would follow that Mr Zhigalev had been the sole founder of ORG . The court held that ORG had been set up by the CARDINAL farmers ( ORG , ORG ORG , ORG , ORG and PERSON ORG ) and the farm \u2019s property had been formed from their property shares . In accordance with LAW , the property of a farm belonged to its partners as their common share property or common joint property , if the latter course was decided unanimously by a farm \u2019s partners . According to the legislation in force at the material time ( LAW ) , a farm \u2019s property was common joint property .", "CARDINAL . The court found no causal link between the adoption of Resolutions nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL and the failure of the farmers to farm the land . The court held that there had been no obstacles to cultivating ORG land . It held that ORG had failed to substantiate his claims and that it was in fact his attitude that had brought about the possibility of losses for the farm .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court dismissed PERSON ORG \u2019s claims as manifestly ill - founded . That judgment was upheld by a decision of ORG of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor of the Kursk Region brought an action against ORG and ORG in defence of state and public interests before ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor requested that ORG no . DATE concerning the right of ownership to the plot of QUANTITY , which had been issued by ORG in Mr ORG \u2019s name , be declared null and void . The same request was made in respect of Land Certificate no . DATE on the right of ownership to the same plot of QUANTITY and the right of life - time inheritable possession to the CARDINAL-hectare plot , which had also been issued by ORG in Mr ORG \u2019s name . The prosecutor stated , inter alia , that the Land Certificates certifying Mr Zhigalev as the sole owner of the land had impaired the rights of the other CARDINAL partners in the farm , each of whom had been entitled to his share of the land .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor also requested a finding of invalidity in respect of Resolutions no . CARDINAL of DATE , on the allocation of a plot of land for the organisation of ORG , and no . CARDINAL of DATE , on the amendment of ORG no . CARDINAL , both of which had been issued by the Head of ORG . The prosecutor argued that the size of the plot of land given to ORG had exceeded the relevant statutory limit .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor requested that Mr Zhigalev , head of ORG , be joined to the proceedings as a third party on the defendant \u2019s side .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE ruled that Mr Zhigalev , head of ORG , was to be joined to the proceedings as a third party because the submitted action concerned his interests . The court referred to LAW , which regulated the procedural status of a third party who did not have separate claims with regard to the subject matter of a dispute .", "CARDINAL . By the same decision , the court ordered the parties to produce documentary evidence and scheduled a hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court adjourned the hearing to CARDINAL DATE in view of ORG failure to produce documentary evidence .", "CARDINAL . The court , composed of CARDINAL judges , held a hearing on DATE . Representatives of the defendant authorities admitted the claim in full . ORG explained that neither of ORG complied with LAW . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , on the basis of which they had been issued .", "CARDINAL . Mr ORG submitted an application to be recognised as a codefendant in the case . In its ruling of CARDINAL DATE , the court refused the application on the ground that the prosecutor \u2019s action concerned the validity of the documents adopted by ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The head of ORG argued that the prosecutor \u2019s claim should be rejected in view of the expiry of the relevant limitation period .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor submitted that the limitation period had been interrupted by ORG adoption , on DATE , of ORG no . CARDINAL on the amendment of Resolutions nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Resolution no . CARDINAL had been reversed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court held that , in accordance with LAW , a limitation period was applied exclusively at the request of a party to a case . As head of ORG , Mr ORG was not a party to the present proceedings pursuant to LAW , and the court could not therefore apply this ground for rejecting the prosecutor \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . Having examined the evidence in the case and heard the prosecutor , the defendants and the head of ORG in his capacity as a third party , ORG of the Kursk Region established the facts of the case as follows , as summarised in its judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG had lodged an application with ORG of the Kursk Region for allocation of a plot of QUANTITY of agricultural land as a life - time inheritable possession ( \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f ) for the founding of ORG , together with the following partners in ORG : ORG , ORG , ORG and PERSON ORG .", "CARDINAL . Following applications by members of the ORG collective farm , namely ORG , ORG ORG , ORG , ORG and PERSON ORG , seeking to leave the farm and be granted a plot of land , on DATE the administration of ORG collective farm had decided that the said individuals would leave the collective farm with a share of CARDINAL hectares each .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of ORG had adopted Resolution no . CARDINAL which stated that , pursuant to the above decision by the administration of ORG collective farm , a plot of QUANTITY from the land of GPE collective farm was to be given , free of charge , in ownership , for the founding of ORG . In the same ORG had ordered that a plot of QUANTITY of plough land be given to ORG in lease for DATE . The ORG had further confirmed V.A. ORG as head of ORG and GPE GPE , GPE ORG , ORG , ORG and PERSON ORG as partners in ORG . The ORG had further stated that ORG had been directed to delimit the plots of land on site and to issue a ORG for the right to use the land .", "CARDINAL . ORG had delimited the plot of QUANTITY on site , drawn up a plan and prepared a ORG , numbered DATE , certifying the right of ownership to this plot of land , in which ORG had been specified as the sole owner of the land .", "CARDINAL . Having examined an application submitted on DATE by ORG , head of ORG , to grant the land to ORG in life - time inheritable possession and not in lease , the Head of ORG had adopted ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE , by which the earlier ORG no . CARDINAL had been amended in respect of the plot of CARDINAL hectares . It had now stated :", "\u2018 That QUANTITY of arable land is to be transferred from a special land fund to ORG in life - time inheritable possession , in the following shares :", "V.A. ORG CARDINAL ha [ hectares ]", "GPE Gerasimov CARDINAL ha [ hectares ]", "ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL ha [ hectares ]", "ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL ha [ hectares ]", "PERSON CARDINAL ha [ hectares ]", "PERSON ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL ha [ hectares]\u2019", "CARDINAL . Following Resolution no . CARDINAL ORG had prepared ORG , numbered DATE , certifying the right of ownership to the same plot of QUANTITY and the right of life - time inheritable possession to the plot of QUANTITY , in which ORG was again specified as the sole owner and possessor of both plots of land .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above findings of fact , ORG of GPE found that the fact that ORG no . DATE did not specify the share of QUANTITY belonging to each partner in ORG ran counter to the content of ORG no . CARDINAL and to the law , particularly section CARDINAL of LAW ( \u00ab \u041e \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c ( \u0444\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c ) \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 GPE ) , which provided that the property of a farm belonged to its members as common share property or as common joint property . The court further held that the same omission \u2013 the lack of information concerning the share of land for each partner in ORG - in ORG no . DATE was unlawful on the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG of the Kursk Region declared Land Certificates no . DATE and no . DATE null and void . The court rejected the remainder of the prosecutor \u2019s claim concerning Resolutions no . CARDINAL of DATE and no . CARDINAL of DATE , issued by the Head of ORG , because the court found no grounds to declare the said Resolutions unlawful .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , head of ORG , appealed against the judgment on the ground that the first - instance court had refused to examine his submission concerning the limitation period . At a hearing on DATE , in which the parties and Mr Zhigalev in his capacity as a third party participated , ORG of ORG of GPE , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , examined the appeal .", "CARDINAL . It noted that on the basis of Resolutions nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , issued by the Head of ORG , the land had been allotted to each of the partners in ORG . Land Certificates no . DATE and no . DATE , issued in Mr Zhigalev \u2019s name on the basis of those ORG , had been found to be unlawful by the firstinstance court .", "CARDINAL . It further noted that it followed from the applicant \u2019s appeal that the only ground for quashing that court \u2019s judgment was its refusal to examine the applicant \u2019s submission concerning the limitation period . However , the court held that , pursuant to LAW , only a party to a case was entitled to request the application of a limitation period . As the applicant was not a party to the case it was not open to him to lodge such a request . The court dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal , in which he requested that the decisions of the lower courts be quashed as they had allegedly been delivered in breach of the procedural and material law . In particular , he complained that his request for participation in the proceedings in the capacity of a defendant had been unlawfully rejected , which allegedly deprived him of the possibility to assert his rights to the land . The appeal was examined on DATE by ORG of ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , in the presence of the parties and Mr Zhigalev as a third party . The court summarised its findings as follows .", "CARDINAL . It followed from the materials of the case file that , in accordance with Resolutions no . CARDINAL and no . CARDINAL , issued by the Head of ORG , the land had been given to each of the partners in ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG had been issued in Mr ORG \u2019s name as the owner of the land , without specifying the shares of the other CARDINAL partners in the farm .", "CARDINAL . As these Land Certificates contradicted ORG no . CARDINAL and section CARDINAL of LAW , which provided that the property of a farm belonged to its members as common share property or common joint property , the first - instance court \u2019s decision to declare null and void LAW issued in Mr Zhigalev \u2019s name had been wellfounded .", "CARDINAL . Resolutions nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG , pursuant to which the plots of land had been allotted for the founding of ORG , had been adopted in accordance with the legislation .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint alleging the court \u2019s failure to join him to the proceedings as a co - defendant , the first - instance court had rightly rejected this request and ordered that the applicant be joined to the proceedings as a third party , because the claims concerned documents adopted by ORG and ORG . The claims had been admitted by the defendants . The parties to the proceedings had not raised the issue of the expiry of a limitation period . Mr ORG was not a party to the present dispute and the right to request the application of a limitation period was therefore not vested in him .", "CARDINAL . In those circumstances the judgment of the first - instance court and the decision of the appeal court had been lawful and well - founded .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG upheld the judgment of ORG of GPE of DATE and the decision of ORG of GPE of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the outcome of the above proceedings , on DATE ORG no . CARDINAL , in which it ordered that the old Land Certificates no . DATE and no . DATE be annulled and a new ORG be issued to ORG by ORG in accordance with ORG Resolution no . CARDINAL of DATE and LAW . In pursuance of Resolution no .

According to the relevant legislation in force at the material time ( the PERSON on LAW and Decrees no . CARDINAL of DATE and no .

The court further addressed the applicant \u2019s argument that ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE was null and void in that it had allotted the land to each of the CARDINAL farmers in equal shares , allegedly in breach of the law . The court held that this issue had already been examined in the earlier proceedings , which had ended with the judgment of ORG of GPE of DATE , as upheld by higher courts , whereby the application to have ORG no . CARDINAL declared null and void had been dismissed . In accordance with LAW no . CARDINAL of ORG of DATE , the above judgment was binding , and the facts once established in a previously decided case were not subject to proof again in a case involving the same persons .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL violated the rights of ORG and his rights as a founder of the farm by depriving the farm of its right of ownership to QUANTITY and its right of life - time inheritable possession to QUANTITY . Mr Zhigalev claimed that all this land should belong to him as head of the farm because he was the only person whose name had appeared on ORG no . DATE and no . DATE . In support of his claims the applicant referred to the unlawfulness of Resolutions no . CARDINAL of DATE and no . CARDINAL of DATE , issued by the Head of ORG , to the lawfulness of Land Certificates no . DATE and no . DATE , issued in his name , and to the fact that ORG had exceeded its authority when adopting ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL . A representative of the defendant ( that is , ORG ) submitted that the contested Resolution no .

The defendant authority further submitted that the applicant now had no documents certifying his title to the land and that neither ORG nor ORG had taken any measures to confiscate the land from ORG , which could continue farming it .", "CARDINAL . The court pointed out that the judgment of ORG of GPE of DATE had declared null and void ORG no . DATE , issued by ORG pursuant to ORG no . CARDINAL , because , in accordance with the legislation then in force , the correct legal document certifying rights to land was a Land Title Certificate , issued by a Department of ORG for ORG Property and Transactions with Immovable Property .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the legal documents establishing the rights to the land in the present case were Resolutions no . CARDINAL and no . CARDINAL of DATE , issued by the Head of ORG . These ORG had been declared lawful by the final judgment of ORG of GPE of DATE , as upheld by higher courts . The applicant \u2019s argument concerning the unlawfulness of the said Resolutions was therefore unfounded .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that Land Certificates no . DATE and no .
