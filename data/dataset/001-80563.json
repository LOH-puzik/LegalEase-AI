Supplementing his earlier statement , Mr PERSON den PERSON described what he had seen from the fifth - floor walkway of the high - rise building . He had seen a uniformed police officer running towards the doorway . He had seen a coloured male go to meet the policeman from the doorway . This man had been walking very slowly , at a snail \u2019s pace . The police officer had wanted to grab hold of the man , by his left arm , as it appeared to Mr PERSON den PERSON . The coloured man had made a gesture as if to push away the police officer . He had hit the police officer , knocking him off balance somewhat , which enabled the coloured man to pass .", "CARDINAL . After he had passed the police officer , the coloured man had drawn a pistol or a revolver , a firearm at any rate , which he had held in his right hand . He had held his arm slanted downwards , thus pointing the pistol towards the ground , and had tried to continue on his way . Mr PERSON den PERSON had not seen the police officers draw their pistols . Feeling threatened by the pistol which the coloured man had drawn and not wishing to be hit by a stray bullet , he had dived for cover . He had therefore not witnessed the actual shooting , but he had heard shouts of \u201c Drop it \u201d several times .", "CARDINAL . Officer PERSON , by then under investigation as a suspected perpetrator of a criminal act , was questioned under caution by Detective Chief PERSON in TIME of DATE . The lawyer retained for him and Officer PERSON , Mr PERSON , was present .", "CARDINAL . Officers Brons and ORG had completed some assignments and had been on their way back to the police station .

They had been told the make of the scooter and its colour and had been given a summary description of the thief and the direction in which he had fled . They had not been told that he was armed .", "CARDINAL . Driving in the direction reported , Officers Brons and ORG had seen a scooter and a driver fitting the description given to them turning into the doorway of a lift in the NORP block of flats . This had surprised them , because they would have expected him to try and evade arrest on noticing that he was being followed by a marked police car .", "CARDINAL . Officers Brons and ORG had agreed that Officer PERSON would go after the thief while Officer PERSON parked the car . Officer PERSON had run towards the doorway holding a CARDINAL - way radio . When Officer PERSON was at a distance of between twenty and QUANTITY from the doorway , the thief had emerged and run for a short distance . He had stopped and raised his hands when he had seen Officer PERSON and shouted something unintelligible .

Officer PERSON had shouted something to him which Officer PERSON had been unable to understand .", "CARDINAL . Officer PERSON had understood that the thief would not come quietly and that Officer PERSON needed help ; he had therefore left the car and run towards them . He had reached a point CARDINAL seven metres from the thief when the thief managed to tear himself loose and ended up at a distance of QUANTITY from Officer PERSON . Suddenly Officer PERSON had seen the thief holding a silver - coloured weapon which he had not seen him draw . It was a small pistol and it was pointed towards the ground . Officer PERSON had not seen whether or not the pistol was cocked . It had seemed to him that Officer PERSON had also seen the pistol , because Officer PERSON had stepped backwards , drawing his service pistol and adopting a defensive posture .

The thief had not reacted by dropping his pistol , much to the surprise of Officer PERSON seeing that Officer PERSON had him covered . Given that the thief was armed and apparently had no intention of doing as he was told , Officer PERSON had considered that Officer PERSON was under threat . He had considered it highly possible that the thief would use his weapon against Officer PERSON . He had been completely focused on the thief . He had seen only the thief , holding a pistol with his finger on the trigger . At that point Officer PERSON had not yet considered it necessary to draw his own service pistol because the thief was covered by Officer PERSON . His hand had been close to , but not on , the holster .", "CARDINAL . Officer PERSON had then seen the thief turn to the right , towards him , and turn the front of his body in his direction at a distance of CARDINAL to QUANTITY . He had seen the thief raise his pistol and point it in his direction . Afraid that the thief would fire at him , Officer PERSON had drawn his pistol from its holster with lightning speed ( bliksemsnel ) and had immediately fired CARDINAL shot at the thief . He had had no time to aim at any particular part of the body . He remained convinced that if he had not fired first , the thief would have shot him .", "CARDINAL . Officer PERSON had thought at the time that he had hit the thief high in the chest . Only later had he learned that he had hit the thief in the neck . The thief had remained on his feet for a short while longer ; he had then tottered and collapsed , dropping the pistol . He had tried to stand up , milling his arms about .

Officers Brons and ORG had been taken back to the police station by a fellow officer . Officer PERSON had handed in his pistol there . Officers PERSON and Bultstra had received assistance and comfort from fellow officers and superiors and had been informed about the further procedure .", "CARDINAL .

Officer PERSON had not seen him stick his hand inside his clothing . Seeing the gesture , Officer PERSON had thought that the man was acting like someone who was about to draw a weapon . His common sense had told him to be on his guard . He had stepped backwards and placed his right hand on his service pistol , releasing the holster clip at the same time . He had not drawn his service pistol but had positioned himself so as to be able to do so immediately . Pointing to the man with his left hand , he had called out : \u201c Show me your hands .

The application was signed by PERSON as the ORG representative and by each of the applicants individually . They stated that the information available did not admit of the conclusion that the shooting of Moravia Ramsahai by Officer PERSON was sufficiently justified . They also pointed out that certain key parts of the investigation after the shooting had been carried out by the GPE / GPE police force \u2013 that is , Officer PERSON \u2019s direct colleagues DATE and argued on that ground that the investigation had not been \u201c effective \u201d and \u201c independent \u201d . Further complaints addressed the failure to question ORG until DATE after the event , the failure to question all the police officers who had arrived at the scene after the shooting about what had been said by ORG , the failure to determine the precise trajectory of the bullet ( which the applicants submitted would have been possible ) , the failure to secure gunshot residue samples from the hands of ORG , the failure to conduct a reconstruction of the incident , and the absence from the autopsy report of drawings or photographs showing the entrance and exit wounds caused by the bullet . Reference was also made to Police Commissioner PERSON \u2019s statement , as reported in the newspaper PERSON , to the effect that he would not allow an independent inquiry , and to the fact that ORG ( hoofdofficier van justitie ) of GPE retained overall responsibility for the investigation and any decision to prosecute .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Acting Procurator General ( plaatsvervangend procureur - generaal ) at ORG submitted an opinion in response to the ORG complaint about the failure to prosecute Officer PERSON .

Although perhaps some might have preferred the non - prosecution decision to have been taken by an official body further removed from the GPE police , that was not a wish which needed to be taken into account by the courts .

On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG complaint against the public prosecutor \u2019s decision not to prosecute . In its reasoning it endorsed the decision of the \u201c judge delegate \u201d not to hold a public hearing .

Moreover , that would defeat the purpose of the applicable legal provisions .", "CARDINAL . As to the merits of the case , ORG was satisfied that Officer PERSON had acted to avert a threat of harm by a deadly weapon and had acted in legitimate self - defence . It based this finding on the statements of ORG and Mr Van den Heuvel . It added that if there had been more time , it might have been possible to avoid inflicting a lethal wound ; however , an immediate reaction had been required in the circumstances , as had subsequently been borne out by the fact that PERSON pistol had had a round chambered and its hammer cocked in the firing position . This conclusion was reinforced by the available information that DATE he had stolen a vehicle at gunpoint and used the pistol in a threatening way on CARDINAL other occasion , as well as by the retrospective finding of traces of alcohol and the active ingredient of hallucinogenic mushrooms in LOC body .

NORP The Minister of ORG \u2019s reply was received in ORG on DATE ( ORG , PERSON \u2013 ORG of ORG , Appendix to the parliamentary record DATE , no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) . The following is an excerpt from it :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It is important to note that there is no question of a substantive violation of LAW ; the ORG is unanimous in finding that the police officer acted in self - defence . The ORG concludes that there has been a procedural violation of LAW on CARDINAL points : the ( excessively ) late involvement of ORG in the investigation and the fact that the decision under LAW not to prosecute the policemen involved was not [ given in ] public . As to the involvement of ORG , a few matters should be noted . ORG does not criticise the position of ORG in relation to the police as such ; it finds explicitly that that position is consonant with the independence required by LAW . However , in this case the investigation into the shooting was carried out during TIME by police officers belonging to the same police force as the police officer who had fired the fatal shot . Only afterwards was the investigation taken over by ORG . The ORG finds that the ( independent ) ORG became involved in the investigation too late in this specific case . Since the decision of ORG of DATE in the GPE case ( unpublished ) , the duty system of ORG has been improved [ aangescherpt ] , so that they can be at the place of the incident sooner . ORG now reaches the scene of events within , on average , TIME and a half after the incident is reported . It is therefore no longer possible to conclude that the procedures now followed in the GPE as regards investigations into fatal shootings involving police officers are not compatible with the LAW . I am therefore of the opinion that structural changes in the existing procedures are not needed . It is , however , useful to make the procedure more precise on some points , in particular as regards the involvement of ORG . To this end , ORG General [ College van procureursgeneraal ] is drawing up a new \u2018 Instruction on how to act in the event of the use of force by a ( police ) officer\u2019 [ PERSON handelwijze bij geweldsaanwending ( politie ) ambtenaar , hereafter \u2018 the Instruction\u2019 ] , to replace [ an earlier instruction ] . This ORG will explicitly provide that ORG shall be informed immediately [ terstond ] in cases where there has been use of force by a police officer , and that the duty officer concerned from ORG shall proceed to the scene of the incident as quickly as possible . Until he arrives , the local police force shall only act to freeze the situation , for example by cordoning off the scene of the incident . However , the local force will , in principle , not carry out investigative measures . This ORG is expected to enter into force early next year .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision such as provided for in LAW , the complainant \u2019s interest in publicity is opposed to the interest in secrecy of the person whose prosecution is sought . The starting point , for the present , is that during the phase in which a decision has yet to be taken as to whether a person is to be prosecuted , that person \u2019s interest in avoiding publicity outweighs the complainant \u2019s interest in publicity . Since a decision under LAW does not concern a \u2018 criminal GPE in the sense of LAW , the requirement of publicity for such decisions does not flow from that Article . In the relevant judgment of ORG , the requirement of publicity is however derived from LAW . The ORG takes the view that the decision should have been given in public , in view of the seriousness of the case and the fact that it concerned a person invested with public authority . It will not be possible to give effect to the judgment without amending LAW .", "At the moment we are still examining the question whether to introduce a request for referral to ORG under LAW . I will inform you of the outcome DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG finds that ORG position in relation to the police is sufficiently independent . The fact that a public prosecutor is dependent on the police for the provision of information and support does not affect this finding . The ORG notes in addition that the actions of the public prosecutor are subject to independent supervision by the courts . In this case the public prosecutor in charge of the case was a public prosecutor with particular responsibility for the area within which the work was carried out at GPE police station , at which station the police officer concerned worked . I share the ORG \u2019s view that it is undesirable ( from the point of view of independence ) for a public prosecutor to maintain excessively close ties with the police force to which the police officers concerned belong . In that connection I refer to the said ORG . This ORG will provide that in cases such as the present the investigation will in no circumstances be led by a public prosecutor who maintains close ties with the district to which the police officers belong , for example the district public prosecutor . I note in addition that ORG [ PERSON ] gives advice on the follow - up to investigations into police use of firearms actually involving firing and where investigations have actually been carried out by ORG . ORG is obliged to submit to ORG the decision he proposes to take . In that way a kind of \u2018 second GPE is built into such cases . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Whenever an incident has taken place to which the ORG applies , the investigation will be carried out by ORG . The regional police force is to inform that department of the incident immediately . The duty officer from ORG will proceed to the scene of the incident as quickly as possible . The local police are to take any necessary urgent measures , such as cordoning off the area concerned , caring for any casualties and taking down the names of any witnesses ; they are not themselves to carry out any investigations unless and to the extent that their involvement is unavoidable .", "CARDINAL . Any investigations that can not be carried out by ORG itself are done by ORG Bureau PERSON ) of the police region concerned or by members of a neighbouring police force . For any technical investigations the assistance of forensic investigators from another police region will be sought .", "CARDINAL . The presumption is that a police officer who needs to resort to force in the exercise of his duty is normally entitled to claim justification through superior orders or self - defence . A police officer in such a position is therefore not viewed as a criminal suspect unless it is clear at the outset that there is reasonable doubt on this point ; he will be questioned as a witness , though under caution that he is not obliged to incriminate himself .", "CARDINAL . The Chief Public Prosecutor , who bears the ultimate responsibility for the investigation and the decision whether to bring a prosecution , is required to ensure that the investigation is not under any circumstances supervised by a public prosecutor who maintains close links with the police unit to which any police officers concerned belong ; every appearance of a lack of independence is to be avoided .", "CARDINAL . If the violent incident has involved the use of a firearm , then before deciding whether or not to bring a prosecution ORG is required to submit the decision he proposes to take and the supporting documents to ORG , which will give an advisory opinion within DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
