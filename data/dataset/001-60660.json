On DATE he had raped ORG , had beaten and strangled her , had forced her to swallow drugs , had burned her skin with cigarettes and had cut her vagina with a knife causing a deep laceration as well as opening the abdominal cavity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Geschworenengericht ) of ORG ( PERSON ) convicted the applicant of both offences of aggravated rape and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In assessing the penalty , the court considered as mitigating circumstances the applicant \u2019s partial confession regarding the rape of ORG and , to some extent , that he had acted under the influence of alcohol and drugs . As aggravating circumstances , the court considered the applicant \u2019s criminal record , the fact that he had committed CARDINAL rapes and the extreme brutality which the applicant had shown when committing the offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a plea of nullity ( GPE ) and an appeal against sentence ( GPE ) . In his plea of nullity the applicant complained , inter alia , that ORG had failed to hear the requested witnesses from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) confirmed ORG judgment as regards the rape of ORG and quashed the judgment as regards the other charge of rape and the sentence . It found that there had been sufficient information to identify the witnesses from GPE and that ORG should have attempted to take this evidence . It remitted the case to that court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the new trial commenced before ORG sitting with another jury and on DATE ORG convicted the applicant of raping PERSON and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . When fixing the sentence the court considered as mitigating circumstances the applicant \u2019s confession regarding some of the facts concerning the charge of having raped ORG and , to a certain extent , his intoxication . As aggravating circumstances it considered the applicant \u2019s criminal record , that he had committed CARDINAL rapes and his extreme brutality when committing the offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a plea of nullity and an appeal against sentence . In his appeal against sentence the applicant submitted that ORG had failed to give sufficient weight to the mitigating circumstances , namely his neglected education , his difficult childhood and his intoxication . The applicant did not request to attend the hearings before ORG or ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in private , rejected as inadmissible the applicant \u2019s plea of nullity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG fixed the hearing date for the applicant \u2019s appeal against the sentence for DATE . The applicant received a notification which stated that he , being detained , could only appear through his counsel and would not be brought to the court as the conditions of LAW [ LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ] of LAW ( GPE ) were not fulfilled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after having held a hearing in the absence of the applicant but in the presence of his defence counsel , dismissed the appeal against the sentence . As regards the weighing of mitigating and aggravating circumstances by ORG , ORG found that the applicant \u2019s partial confession was merely a contribution to the establishment of the truth ( PERSON ) and did not qualify as a mitigating circumstance . Further , there were additional aggravating circumstances such as the particular cruelty which the applicant had used when committing the offences , as well as their concurrent nature ( PERSON strafbarer PERSON ) . As regards the circumstances invoked by the applicant , the", "ORG found that they could not be taken into consideration as mitigating circumstances . A neglected education and difficult childhood could not be considered as the applicant was now an adult and it could not explain his excessive use of brutality . Also no weight could be given to his intoxication because he should have known about the effects of alcohol on his person , and the experts had stated that it had no bearing on him committing the offences . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s offences were not a consequence of a mental defect but of frustration and increased aggression and he had not shown any consciousness of his guilt . Thus , there was no reason to reduce the sentence .", "CARDINAL . A first - instance judgment of an assize court may be challenged by a plea of nullity to ORG on the specific grounds enumerated in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW The sentence as such may be challenged by way of an appeal against sentence to ORG . It may concern both points of law ( in particular whether mitigating or aggravating circumstances have been correctly taken into account ) and factors relating to the assessment of the sentence . Where the substance of an appeal is examined , a public hearing must normally be held . Unless an appeal against sentence is filed together with a plea of nullity and ORG decides on both remedies , such a hearing is held before ORG .", "CARDINAL . As regards the personal appearance of the accused at a public appeal hearing , section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of LAW provides :", "\u201c An accused who is detained shall always be summoned and an accused who is detained shall also be brought before the court if he has made a request to this effect in his appeal or counter - statement or otherwise if his personal presence appears necessary in the interests of justice . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"]}
