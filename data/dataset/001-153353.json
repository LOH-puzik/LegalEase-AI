From the documents submitted it follows that the criminal investigation is still pending .", "CARDINAL . The Government stated that the investigation had not obtained any evidence proving that ORG agents had been involved in the disappearance of the applicants\u2019 brother or that he was dead .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that it had been established \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d that ORG agents had been involved into the abduction and disappearance of Mr PERSON . In support of that assertion they referred to the ample evidence contained in their submission as well as the contents of the criminal investigation file . They also submitted that they had made a prima facie case that their brother had been abducted by ORG agents and that the ORG failed to provide a plausible explanation to the events . In view of the absence of any news of Mr PERSON for a long time and the life - threatening nature of unacknowledged detention in the region at the relevant time , they asked the ORG to consider him dead .", "CARDINAL . The Court shall examine the application at hand in the light of the general principles applicable in cases where the factual circumstances are in dispute between the parties ( see PERSON v. \u201c the former GPE \u201d [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , ECHRCARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has addressed a whole series of cases concerning allegations of disappearances in GPE . Applying the abovementioned principles , it has concluded that if applicants make a prima facie case of abduction by servicemen , this is sufficient for them to show that their relatives fell within the control of the authorities , and it is then for the Government to discharge their burden of proof either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred ( see , among many examples , GPE and Others , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . If the Government fail to rebut that presumption , this will entail a violation of LAW in its substantive part . Conversely , where applicants fail to make a prima facie case , the burden of proof can not be reversed ( see , for example , ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ; Movsayevy v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ; and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has also found in many cases concerning disappearances that a missing person may be presumed dead . Having regard to the numerous cases of disappearances in GPE which have come before it , the ORG has found that in the particular context of the conflict in the region , when a person has been detained by unidentified ORG agents without any subsequent acknowledgment of the detention , this could be regarded as lifethreatening ( see , among many others , GPE and Others v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL , ORG and CARDINAL , DATE , and ORG and Others v. GPE , cited above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has made findings of presumptions of deaths in the absence of any reliable news about the disappeared persons for periods ranging from DATE ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) to DATE .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the circumstances of the present case , the ORG notes that the documents from the investigation file furnished by the Government ( see , for example , paragraphs CARDINAL and QUANTITY above ) demonstrate that the applicants\u2019 brother , Mr PERSON , was detained at home in TIME by a group of armed men and gone missing since . In their submissions to the authorities the applicants consistently maintained that their brother had been abducted by ORG agents ( see , for example , paragraphs DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The investigators took steps to verify this theory ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) . In view of all the materials in its possession , the ORG finds that the applicants have presented a prima facie case that their brother was detained by ORG agents and subsequently disappeared .", "CARDINAL . The Government did not provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation for the events in question . Their arguments are in contradiction to the evidence reviewed by the ORG and insufficient to discharge them of the burden of proof which has been shifted to them in this case .", "CARDINAL . Bearing in mind the general principles enumerated above , the ORG finds that Mr PERSON was taken into custody by ORG agents on DATE . In view of the absence of any reliable news of him since that date and the life - threatening nature of such detention ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG also finds that Mr PERSON may be presumed dead following his unacknowledged detention ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2", "3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1", "5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
