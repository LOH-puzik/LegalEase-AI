The applicants are brothers . They were born in DATE and DATE and live in GPE ( GPE ) and LOC ( GPE ) respectively .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 father owned a piece of real estate located in the centre of the city of LOC , which comprised a plot of land and buildings standing on it .", "CARDINAL . On their father \u2019s death in DATE , the applicants each inherited CARDINAL of that estate .", "CARDINAL . The estate was subsequently seized by a ORG - owned enterprise and some of the buildings were torn down and new ones built . The new buildings included a garage .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG - owned enterprise was privatised and transformed into a joint stock company .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants brought an action for removal of the garage and vacant possession of their land . This action and its outcome is the main subject matter of the present application . The details are given below .", "CARDINAL . In DATE title to a portion of the real estate , which included the garage , was transferred from the joint - stock company to CARDINAL individuals . Consequently , the action of DATE was redirected against them .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants brought another action seeking a judicial ruling declaring them to be the owners of the plot on which the garage was situated and of an adjacent plot . The action was directed against the CARDINAL beneficiaries of the transfer of DATE ( see previous paragraph ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , at which the defendants acknowledged the applicants\u2019 title , ORG ( ORG s\u00fad ) allowed the action of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of the ruling of DATE , the applicants and the defendants settled their differences by exchanging title to the garage for title to the adjacent plot , under the judgment mentioned above , and by setting off their mutual financial claims , including those under the judgments mentioned below .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an action with ORG seeking a judicial order for removal of the garage and vacant possession of their land .", "CARDINAL . ORG ruled on the action on DATE and DATE . These judgments were quashed on appeal ( odvolanie ) and the action was remitted by ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) on DATE and the Pre\u0161ov Regional Court on CARDINAL DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled on the action anew . It relied on the above - mentioned decision of the ORG of DATE in acknowledging that the applicants were the owners of the land on which the garage stood and that the garage had been constructed on that land without the consent of its owners . The garage was therefore considered an \u201c unlawful construction \u201d . It was not practicable ( \u00fa\u010deln\u00e9 ) to remove the garage or to have the applicants take over title to it . The situation had to be resolved under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW by establishing an easement for the benefit of the owners of the garage and by ordering that they pay the applicants compensation in an amount equivalent to QUANTITY ( ORG ) . The amount of compensation was determined on the basis of an expert assessment with reference to existing prices as opposed to future prices .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the judgment of DATE following appeals by both the applicants and the defendants . ORG fully endorsed the reasoning provided by ORG , referred to previous judicial practice and held that in matters such as that at hand the courts were not bound to follow the parties\u2019 specific requests , but rather had to resolve the matter within the parameters set by statute .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants challenged the judgment of CARDINAL DATE by way of an appeal on points of law ( dovolanie ) . They relied on Article CARDINAL ( e ) of LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) and argued that the courts had wrongfully ruled on their action ultra petitum . In particular , the applicants argued that in litigious matters such as theirs the courts were bound by the plaintiffs\u2019 formulation of the claims . The applicants had been seeking a ruling for removal of the garage or alternatively to have them established as the owners of the garage . However , the courts had made a ruling establishing an easement , which had not been sought . In addition , the applicants argued that the lower courts had failed to hear and examine all the evidence they had adduced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) declared the appeal on points of law inadmissible . It upheld ORG view that when dealing with \u201c unlawful constructions \u201d the courts were not bound by the specific requests made by the parties to the proceedings . A specific request for the situation to be resolved by way of establishing an easement had therefore not been required . The applicants did not have a right as such to have all evidence they adduced examined and taken into account . The appeal was thus not admissible on the ground identified by the applicants and neither was it admissible on any other ground envisaged by law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a complaint by the applicants under Article CARDINAL of the LAW , ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) found that ORG had violated their right to a hearing within a reasonable time and ordered that ORG proceed with the case without delay . It awarded each applicant the equivalent of some ORG CARDINAL in just satisfaction in respect of non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a new constitutional complaint . They contested delays in the proceedings subsequent to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE and challenged the judgments of ORG of DATE and the ORG of DATE as having treated them unequally .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible . It discerned no unjustified delays in the proceedings and rejected the relevant part of the application as manifestly ill - founded .", "ORG held that an appeal on points of law was a remedy that was available to the applicants , and observed that they had in fact used it ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . As it was still pending , that part of their constitutional complaint was premature .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a fresh constitutional complaint . They relied , inter alia , on Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL and challenged the rulings of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Pre\u0161ov Regional Court of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) arguing that these rulings were incompatible with their property rights , of which they had failed to obtain protection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible . It found that the complaint had been lodged outside the statutory DATE time - limit in so far as it concerned the rulings of the ORG of DATE and ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The complaint in respect of the decision of ORG of DATE was manifestly ill - founded because that decision was not vitiated by any constitutionally relevant unlawfulness , arbitrariness or irregularity .", "The written version of ORG decision was served on the applicants\u2019 lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The \u201c right to judicial and other legal protection \u201d is laid down in Section ( Oddiel ) CARDINAL of Part ( PERSON ) CARDINAL , dealing with \u201c basic rights and freedoms \u201d . The relevant part of DATE provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

If the violation that has been found is the result of a failure to act , ORG may order [ the authority ] which has violated the rights or freedoms to take the necessary action . At the same time it may remit the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings , order that authority to refrain from violating the fundamental rights and freedoms ... or , where appropriate , order those who have violated the rights or freedoms set out in paragraph CARDINAL to restore the situation to that existing prior to the violation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision on a complaint ORG may grant appropriate financial compensation to the person whose rights under paragraph CARDINAL have been violated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , a complaint under LAW is admissible only where the complainant has used effective remedies provided for by the law to protect his or her fundamental rights . A complaint to ORG can be lodged within DATE of a decision finally taking effect or from the date of a contested measure or notification of another interference with a person \u2019s rights ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The settlement of matters related to \u201c unlawful constructions \u201d is regulated by Article CARDINALc , which provides that \u2013 if a construction is erected on a surface belonging to someone else , the removal of the construction at the expense of its owner may be ordered by a court upon application for this remedy by the owner of the surface ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "If however the removal of the construction does not prove practicable , and subject to consent by the owner of the surface , the court establishes the owner of the surface to be the owner of the construction , in return for the payment of compensation ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The court also has the power to settle the relations between the owner of the surface and the owner of the construction differently , in particular by establishing an easement to enable the exercise of the ownership right in respect of the construction .", "CARDINAL .

They are summarised , for example , in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of GPE PERSON Springer GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In case no . III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL the complainant alleged a violation of his procedural rights and property rights by virtue of judicial decisions at first instance and on appeal . In parallel to his constitutional complaint he lodged an appeal on points of law relying on LAW ( f ) of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible . It found that since the complainant had asserted his rights by way of an appeal on points of law , and since that appeal was still pending , the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in LAW and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW precluded a parallel examination of the same subject matter by ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , however , ORG made a pronouncement concerning the application of the statutory DATE time - limit for lodging a fresh constitutional complaint in the eventuality of a rejection of the complainant \u2019s appeal by ORG . In that respect , \u201c bearing in mind the purpose of the fundamental right to judicial protection under LAW \u201d , and making a specific reference to the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of GPE and GPE v.
