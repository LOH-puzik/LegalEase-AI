PERSON refused saying that he did not have that amount of money ( PERSON testimony , pp . DATE , CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . In reaction , the accused put a knife first to the victim 's neck and then to his stomach and told him that he would beat up him and his wife up . As the accused was under the influence of alcohol and behaved in a vulgar and aggressive manner , his threats made PERSON fear for his and his wife 's life .

That incident was observed , from DATE , by PERSON and PERSON [ also present at the train station ] who decided to inform the police . After their intervention CARDINAL uniformed police officers arrived . Seeing them , the accused started to run away . He was apprehended after a while .

CARDINAL , CARDINAL CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) . He had met PERSON there and had had a quarrel with him ; however , he had stated that they had not been involved in a scuffle and denied that he had threatened him at knifepoint ; he had only insulted him ( pp . CARDINAL , QUANTITY , CARDINAL ) . He also stated that he had proposed that they had a drink to smooth things over ( ... ) PERSON had not wanted to go for a drink but had given him money of his own free will for the purchase of alcohol . Some time later , at the train station , PERSON along with another man had demanded his money back , saying that if he refused things would turn bad for the accused ( pp . CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) . This demand had so annoyed the accused that he had caught PERSON 's shirt and shaken him violently , but , as he stated , he had had no intention of getting into a fight . ( p. CARDINAL ) . ...", "The court refused to consider the explanations given by the accused as credible as they were incompatible with PERSON 's deposition made during the investigation . ... After the accused had been apprehended , PERSON had recognised him as the person who had attacked him and had identified some of the banknotes which he had had with him .", "It is true that on DATE PERSON made a written statement that all charges against the accused were erroneous and were caused by a succession of misunderstandings and that the accused had neither threatened the victim nor his wife , nor used a knife against LANGUAGE ( pp . CARDINAL ) . However , when questioned before ORG , that witness had convincingly explained the motives which had prompted him to make this declaration , saying that he had made it at the request of the accused 's wife and his colleagues as he had not wanted to jeopardise his relationship with the couple ( p. CARDINAL ) . On the same occasion he made a deposition which had fully confirmed his deposition made on DATE ( pp . CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . [ NORP ] admitted that the accused had threatened him and his wife and that he had been using some sort of instrument at that time , but did not remember whether it had indeed been a knife . He emphasised that he had given money to the applicant under threat .", "The court considers that PERSON 's statements were credible and is of the view that his declaration of DATE had been made as a result of pressure exerted on him by the family and friends of the accused . The testimony of that witness is clear , consistent and coherent . ( ... ) It should be emphasised that before the incident PERSON had never met the accused . He did not therefore have any grounds on which to make a false accusation against the accused because he had held a grudge against him .", "PERSON recognised the accused immediately after his apprehension by the police ; he also identified some banknotes which the accused had on him as the same which the accused had previously taken from him . He tried to describe the material events in an objective manner , without over - dramatising or distorting them . It is also of relevance for the assessment of his credibility that the police were informed of the incident by objective by - standers .", "The defence , in its final oral submissions to the court , disregarded these factors relating to PERSON 's credibility . The defence lawyer focused on the fact that PERSON had not been questioned by the trial court and on the procedural shortcoming committed by ORG in that it had failed to summon the applicant and his lawyer to the questioning before that court . Defence counsel stressed the level of education and post held by the accused which , in his view , indicated that he could not have committed the offence at issue .", "The court went on to explain the grounds why it did not consider that the applicant 's denial of having committed the offence was credible . It went on to say :", "The court considers that it is of paramount importance that testimony given by the victim has been confirmed by depositions made by the eyewitnesses to the incident , PERSON and PERSON was standing at the market place just CARDINAL \u2013 CARDINAL.CARDINAL metres away from the victim ( p. CARDINAL ) and he saw the incident clearly .

CARDINAL ) .", "When that witness [ PERSON ] was heard again , at the hearing of QUANTITY DATE , he did not , due to the lapse of time , remember the exact details of the incident ; however , he confirmed his earlier deposition .", "Witness PERSON also confirmed the version of events given by the victim . Questioned immediately after the incident , he had stated that the accused had threatened the victim at knifepoint and with murdering him and raping his wife , and had demanded PLZ CARDINAL,CARDINAL from him . PERSON had given him PLZ CARDINAL and PERSON took the money ( p. CARDINAL ) . When [ that witness ] was questioned at the hearing held on DATE , he had confirmed the veracity of his earlier deposition , even though he did not remember on that occasion whether it had been the accused who had subsequently been apprehended by the police at the train station ( pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "When the trial in the present case was conducted again , attempts to serve the summons on that witness [ PERSON ] so that he could be questioned again failed .", "It should be stressed that it was as a result of the intervention of GPE and PERSON that the accused was apprehended by the police . Neither knew the accused or the victim before ; hence they could not have had any reasons for falsely accusing him .", "Neither the accused nor his lawyer made any concrete objections as to the veracity of the depositions made by these CARDINAL witnesses .", "The court concluded that the evidence in the case , seen as a whole , allowed the conclusion that the applicant was guilty as charged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's legal - aid lawyer lodged an appeal against this judgment . He submitted that the court had based its finding of guilt on testimony given by the victim PERSON , despite the fact that he had never been heard by the NORP court and the \u0141uck court had failed to summon the applicant and his lawyer to the questioning . It had also failed to question PERSON 's wife . This rendered the conviction unsafe .", "CARDINAL . A hearing before the appellate court was held on DATE in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer . The court upheld the firstinstance judgment . It stressed , inter alia , that ORG had expressly requested the NORP authorities to summon them to that hearing ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The first - instance court could not be held responsible for the NORP authorities ' failure to summon the applicant and his lawyer for the questioning of witnesses before ORG , as requested . Moreover , ORG had afterwards summoned both PERSON and his wife to the hearings to be held on DATE and DATE , to no avail . Furthermore , the applicant 's lawyer had acquiesced to the prosecutor 's request that the depositions of witnesses who had not been questioned during the trial be read out from the file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's legal - aid lawyer lodged a cassation appeal with ORG . It was argued that the hearing before the appellate court was unfair in that the applicant had not been assisted by an interpreter .

On DATE ORG held the cassation hearing in the presence of the applicant 's legal - aid lawyer . It quashed the judgment of DATE and remitted the case for re - examination to that court . It observed that the absence of an interpreter at the hearing held on DATE constituted a serious procedural shortcoming and limited the applicant 's procedural rights . It further noted that the remaining arguments submitted by the applicant were merely a re - statement of the grounds of appeal which had already been examined by the appellate court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing in the case in the presence of the applicant , his legal - aid lawyer and an interpreter . On DATE the court delivered its judgment in the presence of an interpreter . It upheld the first - instance judgment . The court stated that the failure of ORG to comply with the terms of the international judicial assistance request could not , by itself , justify the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings against the applicant . Nor should it have prevented ORG from reading out PERSON 's deposition before that court . The applicant had been aware of the questions to be put to PERSON before ORG . He had not contested them and had not requested that they be supplemented by any other questions . Under LAW , the parties had a right to participate in the taking of evidence carried out by a judge or court other than the one examining the merits of a case , but their participation was by no means mandatory . The first - instance court had repeatedly taken steps with a view to examining both PERSON and his wife in the applicant 's presence , in conformity with the recommendations formulated by ORG on DATE . However , as all these efforts had failed , that court was justified in considering that it had been ultimately impossible to have this evidence taken before that court in adversarial proceedings .", "In so far as the applicant relied on lack of legal aid during the investigation held in DATE and DATE , ORG noted that it was only after DATE had entered into force that a grant of legal aid to a foreign citizen became possible . In any event , after the entry into force of that Code the case - law of ORG had already affirmed that lack of legal aid at the pre - trial stage of proceedings could serve as a basis for quashing a judgment only when it had not been subsequently rectified by a grant of legal aid at the judicial stage of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's defence counsel lodged a cassation appeal against this judgment , essentially reiterating his previous arguments .", "CARDINAL .
