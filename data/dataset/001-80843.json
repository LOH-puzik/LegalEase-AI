The inspector in charge stamped the invoice for the purchase of the car to indicate that the customs formalities had been accomplished and no customs clearance was needed .", "On DATE ORG registered the applicant \u2019s vehicle .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicant that he had failed to comply with clearance requirements when he imported his motor vehicle into GPE and had to present his car to ORG before DATE to obtain clearance .", "By a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG notified the applicant that he had failed to pay customs duties and other related taxes on his imported car totalling ORG ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) in time .

According to the directive issued by ORG of GPE on DATE ... , a customs control can not be finalised unless there is proof of the transfer of customs duties and other taxes collected in GPE to the federal budget of GPE . The customs officer sent no such request to the NORP authorities and , accordingly , such proof is missing .", "The customs officer , who checked and stamped your documents did , therefore mislead you ... and will take responsibility for this . However , this does not absolve you of the obligation to clear duly the motor vehicle through customs in the proper manner .", "As you failed to produce the vehicle within the fixed time - limit and did not perform the customs clearance in ORG in compliance with [ our ] orders of DATE and DATE , administrative proceedings for breach of customs regulations have been brought against you ... \u201d", "The applicant stated that he had never received the order of DATE and that he had attended ORG once , on receipt of the first summons .", "The applicant challenged the decision of ORG concerning the imposition of the duties and a fine in court .", "On DATE the ORG of GPE ( \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0448\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u041c\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 ) gave a judgment in the applicant \u2019s favour .", "It found that the applicant \u2019s vehicle pertained to a category of goods originating in a third country that had been duly released into free circulation on the territory of GPE .

It noted that the court decision of DATE was res judicata in the applicant \u2019s case and therefore the applicant was under an obligation to pay the customs duties amounting to ORG ( approximately LAW ) . However , it absolved the applicant of payment of the surcharges after noting that his failure to pay the customs duties in time had been due to the general uncertainty and ambiguity of the regulations governing the import of goods from GPE to GPE .", "On DATE ORG upheld the first instance judgment on appeal .", "According to the applicant , he had to pay the sum due by instalments because of its size . He discharged his obligation in full in DATE .", "LAW provides , as follows :", "\u201c Import customs duties , taxes and contributions of equivalent value on goods originating in a third country shall be levied in the budget of ORG which is the country where such goods are consigned . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG provides , so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c The Contracting Parties ... shall abolish customs control at the border between them ... provided that reliable customs control is exercised at their external borders \u201d .", "In line with the Agreement , on CARDINAL DATE the President of GPE issued decree no .

In order to obtain the exemption a document had to be produced proving that the import duties paid to the NORP customs authorities had been transferred into the budget of GPE .
