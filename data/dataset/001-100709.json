On DATE a mother contacted the police on account of a suspicion that her child A. , a boy born in DATE , had been sexually abused by a family friend , the applicant . On the same date the police took a statement from the mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE was interviewed at the children 's hospital at the request of the police . The interview was conducted by a psychologist . The investigating police officer , the head psychologist of the hospital , and the deputy head physician PERSON , specialised in child psychiatry , followed the interview behind a mirrored wall . The interview was recorded on video - tape . The applicant was not present when the interview was conducted and apparently he had not even been informed about the investigation at that point .", "CARDINAL . A psychological examination was performed on NORP on CARDINAL occasions , namely CARDINAL and DATE , by the head psychologist . A physical examination was also performed . The mother was interviewed by a specially trained nurse on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr S. and the CARDINAL psychologists gave a written statement of their findings . They concluded that ORG 's account seemed reliable , that is , he was recounting events that had very likely taken place . Certain changes in ORG 's behaviour were also mentioned which , according to those medical experts , reflected sexual abuse to which he had been subjected . According to PERSON and the CARDINAL psychiatrists , no such circumstances had emerged in the examinations , or the previous information produced in the case , which supported some alternative explanation to PERSON 's account and symptoms . No specific findings of ORG 's physical examination were mentioned in the statement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr S. gave another statement noting , inter alia , that issues regarding the suspected abuse had disturbed ORG 's psychological balance and caused him confusion , insecurity and anxiety . In her opinion , subjecting ORG to more questions about the matter would be harmful to him and he should not be interviewed again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police questioned the applicant as a suspect . He denied all allegations of sexual abuse . On DATE , after having taken another statement from ORG 's mother , the police closed the pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor preferred charges against the applicant with ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tt ) accusing him of having sexually abused PERSON", "CARDINAL . After having been served with the summons , the applicant contacted a lawyer . On DATE he submitted a communication to ORG noting that , apparently , the prosecutor intended to present the video recording of PERSON 's interview as evidence before the court . The applicant agreed that , in the light of PERSON last statement , PERSON should not be heard again . He pointed out , however , that he had not been afforded an opportunity to put questions to A. during the pre - trial investigation as required by section CARDINAL(a ) of LAW ( esitutkintalaki , f\u00f6runders\u00f6kningslagen , Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL with later amendments ) . Nevertheless , instead of requesting the court to exclude A. 's account due to that procedural error , the applicant wished to submit the video recording as evidence on his behalf . In the applicant 's view the recording contained certain absurdities and showed that GPE was merely repeating sentences that he had been rehearsed to say .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held its first session . Having heard the prosecutor 's opening arguments , the applicant now claimed that the video recording could not be used in evidence , since his legal right to put questions to the witness had not been respected . The prosecutor was of the opinion that the recording should be viewed in order to allow the court to assess PERSON 's level of maturity and the value of his account as evidence . The complainant , that is NORP represented by his mother , joined the prosecutor 's pleadings . After a discussion concerning the recording , the applicant consented to its being viewed and the court proceeded with the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The court was presented with the CARDINAL written statements given by the psychologists and PERSON During its first session , the court also received testimony from PERSON 's mother , the applicant and the applicant 's former wife . PERSON 's mother testified on the events leading to her suspicions of sexual abuse and what PERSON had told her about those events . The applicant 's former wife testified to his character . The court held another session on DATE , during which the video recording of ORG 's interview was played back . It appears that PERSON gave testimony in that connection as a medical expert making also an assessment of the credibility of ORG 's account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered its judgment . As to the proceedings , it noted that the law did not allow the use of video - taped testimony of a person DATE if the accused had not been provided with an opportunity to have questions put to that person . It observed that the applicant had not been afforded such an opportunity . It further observed PERSON statement concerning the negative consequences for DATE if interviewed again . The court acknowledged that there had been a procedural error which could not be rectified . However , it noted that the video recording of A. 's interview had been shown to the court with the applicant 's consent and PERSON had given testimony as to the credibility of his account .", "CARDINAL . As to the merits , the court found that neither ORG 's account nor the other evidence presented to it supported the charge and acquitted the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor and the complainant appealed against the judgment to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tt ) . In his response to their pleadings , the applicant again pointed out the flaw in the proceedings in respect of his right to examine witnesses against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing . It was presented with the same evidence as ORG , along with some fresh written evidence .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor named the video recording of A. 's interview as evidence , with no opposition from the complainant party . The applicant , on the other hand , maintained his argument that he had been deprived of his legal right to put questions to A. and that the court should assess whether the video recording could , in those circumstances , be admitted . The applicant further argued that his consent in ORG was not relevant in that respect and that he had not himself submitted the recording as evidence .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal observed that , in ORG hearing of DATE , the applicant had named the video recording as evidence in its totality . The applicant then argued that he had been left with no other choice , as ORG had allowed PERSON to testify to ORG 's account , which was merely second - hand evidence . He further stated that if ORG were , in turn , also to allow the use of PERSON testimony and her written statement concerning PERSON ' interview , he would have to name the video recording as evidence again . In response to the court 's inquiry as to what questions the applicant had wished to ask PERSON , he mentioned a certain detail about A. 's account of events for which he wanted to have a clarification . He had also wished to ask PERSON if his mother had told him about the interview beforehand and whether she had asked him to say anything in particular .", "CARDINAL . The court made reference to the relevant legislation and its travaux pr\u00e9paratoiresIt noted , in particular , that due to the circumstances mentioned in PERSON statement of DATE , it had not been possible to hear A. again . The court found that ORG 's videotaped account was to be considered as a statement given in a pre - trial investigation , within the meaning of LAW , LAW , of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) . Since the applicant had not been given the opportunity to put questions to A. , in a manner described in more detail in LAW , the video recording of A. 's interview could not , in principle , be played back before the court and used in evidence . The court found , however , that testimony about A. 's account of the alleged events could be received from his mother . The statement concerning PERSON 's interview , and testimony by PERSON on that matter , were also permissible . The court then noted the applicant 's submissions that , under those circumstances , he would invoke the video recording as evidence . Having regard to the fact that he had already done so in ORG , it found that the recording could also be treated as evidence in ORG . Consequently , the video recording was played back in the appellate court 's oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment . It found that the accounts given by A. , his mother and PERSON , as well as the written statement concerning ORG 's psychological examination , showed that the applicant had committed one of the sexual acts specified in the indictment . It convicted him of sexual abuse of a child and sentenced him to one year 's suspended term of imprisonment .", "CARDINAL .

The investigator may decide that the questions are to be put through him or her . A party and his or her counsel have the right to request the investigator to ask the person being questioned about matters necessary for the clearing up of the case at other times as well ( section CARDINAL , Act No .

The suspect must be provided with an opportunity to put questions to the witness . The suspect may also put questions through legal counsel or another representative .

A statement in a pre - trial investigation report or another document may , as a rule , not be admitted as evidence in court .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the above - mentioned provision places emphasis on both the idea that giving testimony before the court may be detrimental to , inter alia , a child and on the importance of respecting the rights of the defence . The PERSON states that a recorded account could be used in evidence even where the defendant has not availed him or herself of the opportunity to put questions to the witness in question , provided that he or she had been afforded such an opportunity . The PERSON does not recognise an exception to that rule .", "CARDINAL . As to the hearing of a child under DATE at the trial , LAW , LAW No .

ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ( voting ) examined the question of admissibility as evidence of a video recording in a case concerning alleged sexual abuse of a child . In that case the plaintiff child 's interview had been recorded on video - tape during the pre - trial investigation . The defendant had not , however , been afforded an opportunity to put questions to the child . In its procedural decision ORG stated :", "\u201c ...", "ORG notes that during the pre - trial investigation A. had not been provided with an opportunity to put questions to PERSON , who is a minor . Thus , and having regard to LAW , Article CARDINAL ) of the Code of Judicial Procedure , PERSON 's account , recorded on video - tape , should not have been used in evidence by the lower courts . Those courts should have brought that issue to the defendant 's attention on their own initiative . There would not , however , have been any impediment as to the use of the video recording in evidence had the defendant been given explicit consent to it or if the handicap caused by the lack of opportunity to put questions to the child could have been rectified before the court by , for example , hearing PERSON in person .", "When considering the admissibility of the video recording as evidence in ORG , the court firstly notes that absolute prohibitions [ in that respect ] are exceptional in the NORP legal system . The main rule is the principle of free assessment of evidence . That largely leaves it up to the parties to decide what circumstances and evidence they wish to invoke in their case . It is left to the court 's discretion to decide which evidentiary value it attributes to each piece of evidence .", "The restriction on the admissibility of recorded statements laid down in LAW , Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW is ultimately aimed to ensure a fair trial for the suspect . Therefore , in the interpretation of the extent of that restriction , attention must be paid to the proceedings as a whole . LAW , Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the [ Code ] in turn lays down the principle that , if a witness can not be heard before the court in person , the court may admit as evidence his or her recorded statement even if it is , according to the main rule , otherwise inadmissible as evidence .", "... \u201d", "ORG went on to note that the child had not been heard before the lower courts , nor could that flaw be rectified by hearing [ him ] before ORG , given [ his ] young age and level of development and the time elapsed since the alleged events . ORG observed that the defendant had been represented by counsel already at the pre - trial stage . He could thus have requested an additional interview with the child prior to the trial . As he had not done so , nor made any argument concerning the lack of opportunity to put questions to the child until ORG drew [ his ] attention to that issue , it seemed likely that the defendant had not been disadvantaged by that flaw in the proceedings . The court also found that the defendant had apparently considered that submitting the video recording as evidence , even in ORG , benefited his defence . ORG concluded that the use of the video recording , already played back before the lower courts , did not compromise the defendant 's right to a fair trial . Moreover , he was able to express his opinion on the evidentiary value of that recording in ORG oral hearing . ORG thus admitted the recording as evidence . Having held its oral hearing , the court upheld the defendant 's conviction .", "CARDINAL . In another ORG precedent concerning alleged sexual abuse of a child , no . ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL , the question at stake was hearsay evidence . The court noted , at the outset , that such evidence was not prohibited by the domestic law and could be taken into account according to the principle of free assessment of evidence . In this case , the complainant child had initially been examined by a psychologist , who had interviewed her on CARDINAL occasions . These interviews had given rise to a suspicion of sexual abuse and led to a criminal complaint . At the request of the police , the child had been interviewed again , now as a part of the pre - trial investigation . Unlike the previous interviews , the third interview had been recorded on video - tape , but the suspect was not given an opportunity to put questions to the child . In that third interview , the child had retracted her previous statements . Charges were subsequently brought and the defendant was convicted of sexual abuse . The conviction was upheld on appeal . According to the appellate court the main evidence against the defendant had not been the video - taped interview but the child 's account as given to the psychologist . That court found it very unlikely that hearing the child again would shed more light on the matter , as the child had retracted her initial account .", "ORG noted that the courts had not been able to assess the child 's own original account of events but they had only to rely on the psychologist 's testimony and written statement in that respect . This prevented a reliable assessment being made of the child 's third , video - taped interview . Furthermore , as the defendant had not been given an opportunity to put questions to the child , the conviction could not be based to a decisive degree on the hearing of the psychologist . In the absence of other substantial evidence in support of the charge , ORG acquitted the defendant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
