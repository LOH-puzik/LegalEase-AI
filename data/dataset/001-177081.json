The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are the parents of PERSON , who was born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The latter was detained in the psychiatric wing of FAC on CARDINAL occasions , from DATE to CARDINAL DATE and from CARDINAL DATE to DATE , that is to say for a total period of DATE . On both occasions he benefited from discharges on probation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in private session , once again ordered the detention of the ORG son under DATE ORG in respect of ORG , Habitual Offenders and LAW as amended by act of DATE ( \u201c the Social Protection Act \u201d ) . During his detention in the psychiatric wing of PERSON he was the subject of several disciplinary measures owing to his aggressive attitude to staff and other detainees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ordered his discharge on probation and made him subject to medico - social supervision by attaching a number de conditions to his provisional discharge .", "CARDINAL . By order of CARDINAL DATE , owing to his non - compliance with his conditions of discharge , ORG with ORG decided to return the ORG son to the psychiatric wing of FAC . PERSON was arrested on that same date and detained for insulting and threatening CARDINAL police officers .", "CARDINAL . On his arrival at the police station TIME , he was examined by a general practitioner before being transferred in TIME to FAC , where he was examined by PERSON , who prescribed a sedative and a sleeping tablet .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 son was then placed in an individual cell in an ordinary section of FAC .", "CARDINAL . The course of events as set out below was established following the judicial investigation and proceedings and is undisputed by the parties .", "CARDINAL . At TIME DATE PERSON was presented before the Deputy Director of PERSON for his interview as a new arrival . After the interview , the Deputy Director decided to implement special security measures for DATE . Those measures were adopted owing to PERSON nervous , agitated state and because he considered his detention to be arbitrary and was demanding his release . The following special security measures were ordered : placement in an individual cell , individual access to the prison yard , receiving visits in a booth rather than in the collective visiting area , use of plastic knives and forks , opening of the cell only by heads of section accompanied by CARDINAL prison officers , accompaniment by a member of staff during the detainee \u2019s movements and implementation of special surveillance involving checks on the cell by a prison officer TIME to ensure that nothing abnormal was happening .", "CARDINAL . Prison officer NORP , who had accompanied PERSON since his return to prison , was instructed to inform him of those special security measures in his capacity as head of section acting as a prison assistant . He was accompanied by CARDINAL other officers , PERSON and NORP", "CARDINAL . On their arrival in the cell at TIME , PERSON was just finishing his lunch . NORP read out the special security measures ordered by the Director . According to NORP \u2013 as confirmed by PERSON and NORP \u2013 PERSON provoked him by deliberately sneezing ( or \u201c spitting \u201d , according to the Government ) on him . When PERSON told the detainee to stop his provocative behaviour , otherwise he would be moved to an isolation cell , PERSON moved up to him and placed his head so close to R. \u2019s that all CARDINAL officers thought that they was about to be attacked .", "CARDINAL . In view of PERSON reaction and his previous history , NORP decided to place him in an isolation cell . He seized PERSON by the scruff of his neck and NORP grabbed his shoulder in order to whisk him out of the cell .", "CARDINAL . R. explained that owing to the exiguity of the cell , he was unable to maintain his grip on the back of the detainee \u2019s neck and he decided to resort to a different stranglehold technique , which involved an \u201c armlock \u201d around the detainee \u2019s neck , while forcing him down to the ground . When PERSON was face - down on the floor , he was still immobilised in an armlock by NORP , who was also leaning his full weight on the upper part of his back . PERSON had allegedly then complained that he could not get any air and was suffocating . L. blocked the detainee \u2019s right arm ; his left arm was already blocked under L \u2019s body . Finally , NORP squatted on top of the detainee .", "CARDINAL . Reinforcements were called in , and several more officers arrived on the spot . A total of CARDINAL officers were now present . Some of them helped with keeping PERSON under control while others remained passive . PERSON was handcuffed and shackles were placed on his ankles .", "CARDINAL . He was then lifted to his feet to be transported by CARDINAL officers , including NORP , to the isolation cell . The ORG witness statements diverge on PERSON ability to talk and breathe on his way to the cell . However , they all agree that they had to drag him along , supporting him under the shoulders and then carrying him , and that his head was hanging down . The officers noted that he had urinated on himself . They had to carry him down CARDINAL or so steps to reach the isolation cell .", "CARDINAL . On arrival at the door to the isolation cell , the officers placed PERSON face down on the floor owing to the narrowness of the door , and dragged him inside . Once they were inside the isolation cell they turned him over , only to note that his face was cyanotic .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the prison nurse received a telephone call to inform her that PERSON was unconscious . She alerted the duty doctor and prepared the medical equipment .", "CARDINAL . When the nurse and the duty doctor arrived at the inner security gate of the prison , an officer , who had been a witness to the events , informed them that the \u201c service CARDINAL \u201d ( the medical emergency service ) and the ORG ( emergency ambulance service ) had been called at TIME A transcription of the call is included in the case file .", "CARDINAL . Pending the arrival of those services , the duty doctor and the prison nurse began a cardiac massage at TIME , having noted that PERSON was not breathing and had no pulse .", "CARDINAL . The \u201c service CARDINAL \u201d paramedics arrived at TIME However , they noted that the ORG had not been contacted , and decided to request its emergency intervention . A \u201c service CARDINAL \u201d nurse subsequently stated that they had been called for a straightforward assault and had therefore not been informed of the gravity of the situation .", "CARDINAL . The ORG arrived at TIME and PERSON was immediately intubated and put on a drip . However , the doctor could only note that in the absence of electrical activity it was pointless to continue the attempts at resuscitation .", "CARDINAL . PERSON death was recorded at TIME", "CARDINAL . An inquiry was immediately instigated ex officio . The forensic pathologist instructed by ORG travelled to the scene of the events at TIME on DATE and noted very extensive cyanosis of the face and the neck region , and the presence of food products in the region of the nostrils and mouth .", "CARDINAL . All the main witnesses were heard on DATE or in the ensuing days .", "CARDINAL . At his first hearing on DATE , NORP stated the following , as regards the prison ORG intervention :", "\u201c PERSON arrived in prison DATE in a state of high nervous tension . In fact the police officers accompanying him described him as very dangerous .", "On arrival PERSON was very worked up against the police . We took over and he calmed down .", "We knew PERSON from his previous detention , and so , for security reasons we placed him in an individual cell in the CARDINALth section , cell no . CARDINAL . According to my information he did n\u2019t cause any trouble during TIME .", "TIME PERSON went to see Director [ H. ] for the \u2018 incomer \u2019s PERSON , as for every new arrival .", "I was present during this interview in the office used for that purpose .", "PERSON started shouted about the police officers , calling them disabled and claiming it was their fault he was there .", "The Director explained that he had to visit the ORG ( ORG ) . PERSON replied that he did not have to wait around and that he was going to fetch his keys in the cloakroom and leave . When we told him that was impossible , he threatened us with the words \u2018 you \u2019ll get what \u2019s coming to you\u2019 .", "Knowing that PERSON had a capricious and unforeseeable character and had already attacked officers in the past , the Director imposed special measures on him such as an individual cell , opening the cell door by several officers , using plastic knives and forks , etc .", "He was taken back to his cell by a number of officers , without incident .", "Where special measures are ordered , they must be entered in writing and signed by the detainee .", "At TIME I went to his cell accompanied by [ L. , NORP and C. ] . PERSON was eating when we went in .", "When I explained the measures to him , PERSON got up and pretended to sneeze , spitting some of his dinner ( vol - au - vent ) in my face . I stepped back . PERSON moved towards me and started sneezing again .", "I immediately told him to calm down and to spit somewhere else . He moved towards me again . I told him that if he did not calm down he would be moved to the isolation cell . He came right up to me , with his head against mine , and said \u2018 I \u2019d like to see you doing that\u2019 . I then grabbed him by the neck in order to force him to the ground and take him to the isolation cell . I should point out that I got him in an armlock before pushing him off balance .", "My colleagues were holding him by the arms and legs . We called for reinforcements . While I was holding him I spoke to him and he answered \u2018 I \u2019m choking\u2019 . I relaxed my hold and told him that if he could talk he was not choking .", "PERSON was gesticulating with his arms and legs . I would specify that I fell to the ground with PERSON and he was on his side . In the end I was no longer holding him around the neck but exerting pressure on his head .", "The reinforcements arrived and we managed to handcuff him . We lifted him to his feet in order to take him to the isolation cell . The reinforcements took charge of PERSON , and I started following them up near the rotunda after I PERSON got my breath back . PERSON was no longer protesting , relaxing to the extent that the officers had to carry him . Arriving at the cell I realised that PERSON was not pretending , as his face was turning blue . We called the infirmary and also the ORG . Dr [ L. ] was at the prison , and PERSON was given first aid , including artificial respiration , for TIME . He was also defibrillated . I stayed beside the doctor the whole time . The ambulance arrived and I stayed in the cell to help them . When the ORG arrived I left the cell and waited in the corridor . From what I heard it was already too late . They had n\u2019t managed to resuscitate him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Later on the same day NORP was questioned again , and he added the following statement :", "\u201c I would point out that during my explanation of the reasons for the [ special security ] measures I noticed the expression in PERSON eyes changing and becoming more threatening , such that I was already on my guard when he got up .", "When he was there with his forehead pressed against mine , I moved aside and got him in an armlock , that is I placed my right arm around his neck and fell to the ground with him . You ask me if I exerted pressure on his neck , and I would reply that I did not press on the front of his throat . Once we were on the floor on the corridor side of the cell door I reduced the pressure . When he started to struggle again I exerted a small amount of pressure and slackened it immediately . In any case he was talking to me , as I mentioned in my first statement .", "...", "We have not been trained in restraining detainees in critical situations . Following the events at GPE we were given \u2018 conflict management GPE , learning how to manage a conflict by talking , and especially how to prevent things getting out of hand . My answer to your question is that in the event of an attack by a detainee we just have to do our best to restrain him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Officer NORP made the following statement :", "\u201c We pinned PERSON to the ground . ... I did n\u2019t hear PERSON speaking , but I think he was trying to talk but nothing came out . ... On the way to the isolation cell I did n\u2019t hear him talking or complaining . ... I think he was still alive because several times I felt resistance in his arm . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Dr B. carried out the autopsy DATE , on DATE . The autopsy report of CARDINAL DATE concluded that the manoeuvres on his neck had caused injuries deep enough to fracture the right upper horn of the thyroid cartilage and that those injuries had been prolonged , because symptoms of asphyxiation had been observed . The report added that the loss of urine reported by the investigators pointed to the moment when the loss of consciousness became so deep as to inhibit the sphincter reflex mechanism . Such an inhibition could be observed , for instance , during the unconscious phases occurring in epileptic episodes . As regards the \u201c armlock \u201d restraint technique , the autopsy report stated :", "\u201c During the compression exerted by a forearm ( acting as a lever , with the person standing behind the victim ) , the lethal mechanism is virtually identical to traditional manual strangulation .", "Such particularly severe compression causes a bilateral vascular obstruction and a flattening of the upper respiratory channels against the cervical vertebrae . \u201d", "CARDINAL . An investigation was instigated on DATE against persons unknown on charges of grievous bodily harm having led to unintentional death . The applicants applied to join the proceedings as civil parties .", "CARDINAL . The reconstruction of the events led PERSON , who had carried out the autopsy , to the conclusion that the cervical manoeuvres had been caused by the armlock applied by NORP , while the weight applied by PERSON on PERSON thorax had had a negative effect on the latter \u2019s respiratory mechanism and been conducive to asphyxia , his respiration being further hindered by the manner in which he had been transported to the isolation cell .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG committed the CARDINAL accused , that is to say NORP , PERSON and NORP , for trial before ORG on charges of grievous bodily harm having led to unintentional death .", "CARDINAL . At DATE hearing before ORG , PERSON submitted that it was not impossible that the detainee \u2019s fall to the ground had produced the force leading to the fracture of the right upper horn of the thyroid cartilage and that it had been quite possible that the armlock had on its own been sufficient to bring about the fatal outcome . He was , however , unable to affirm that if the strangulation had ceased after the thyroid cartilage had been broken PERSON would have been able to breathe again normally and survive , since the outcome would have depended on the injuries sustained previously . Furthermore , PERSON took the view that the compression of the thorax and the fact that PERSON had been carried to the isolation cell were not , in themselves , sufficient to have caused his death . Finally , he confirmed that the version of events provided by NORP during the reconstruction had been compatible with the medical findings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted NORP The court held that NORP \u2019s intervention had indisputably been a matter of self - defence , which ruled out any responsibility on his part . Having regard to PERSON personality and his nervous , agitated state , NORP could reasonably have feared an imminent serious attack against PERSON and himself . The accused \u2019s reaction had therefore been absolutely necessary . The court accordingly considered that NORP had react proportionately to the attack by applying a hold which he had learnt during training in the management of that kind of incident , and in respect of which nothing in the case file suggested that it had been wrongly executed . Subsequently , the continuation of the armlock had been equally justified and proportional in view of the fact that PERSON had continued to struggle . According to the court , there was no objective evidence to suggest that the accused \u2019s actions had been dangerous , or that NORP had used force not strictly necessary for the execution of the restraint technique . There was no indication that NORP had known , or should have known , about the risk of fracture of the thyroid cartilage since that risk was not mentioned in the training programmes included in the case file ; nor could he have been aware that in maintaining the hold he had been exacerbating the decrease in the oxygenation of PERSON blood , particularly since NORP had not known what his colleagues were doing . Moreover , the court considered that NORP must not have been alarmed by the detainee \u2019s reactions since he had continued to struggle and NORP had regularly relaxed his grip to let him breathe . There was no evidence that the accused had noticed any change in the detainee \u2019s voice resulting from the fracture of the thyroid cartilage , nor , in any event , that they could have connected that putative change with any risk to PERSON physical integrity .", "L. and NORP were also acquitted under the rules on co - perpetration .", "Moreover , ORG relinquished jurisdiction for determining the applications for civil - party status owing to the accused \u2019s acquittal .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , as civil parties , appealed against the judgment as regards its civil - law provisions . The prosecution did not follow suit . The appeal has been pending before ORG since DATE . The ORG submitted that the applicants had not requested notification of the hearing such as to facilitate adjudication of the civil - law interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a criminal complaint , together with an application to join the proceedings as civil parties , against the CARDINAL acquitted prison officers and CARDINAL of their colleagues for failure to assist a person in danger .", "On DATE ORG , sitting in private session , declared inadmissible the application to join the proceedings as civil parties to the extent that it concerned the CARDINAL prison officers acquitted by judgment of ORG on DATE on the grounds that the facts were identical to those of the first set of criminal proceedings , and gave a discontinuance decision in respect of the other CARDINAL accused on the grounds that the investigation had not uncovered sufficient evidence against them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants further filed an action for damages before ORG of First Instance seeking a finding that ORG had been responsible for PERSON death and for the suffering which he had sustained owing to his placement in an ordinary cell instead of in the psychiatric wing of LOC .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of First Instance declared the claim inadmissible as being time - barred .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the Government submitted that the applicants had complained about the same facts in GPE , PERSON country of origin , and that that complaint had given rise to letters rogatory addressed to ORG by the NORP public prosecutor of the town of GPE . On DATE the NORP authorities had allegedly sent a scanned copy of the criminal case file to the NORP judicial authorities .", "The applicants , however , denied ever having brought proceedings in GPE .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
