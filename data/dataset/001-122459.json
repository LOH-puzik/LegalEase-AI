NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , stateless , was born in DATE and resides at present in GPE . He is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG . ORG were represented by their Agent , Ms. PERSON , and their co - agent , Ms. PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant entered GPE on DATE , where his fingerprints were taken firstly at the PERSON in GPE . It was noted that the applicant was born in GPE in DATE and that he had entered ORG illegally . He was then transferred to the \u201c PERSON \u201d ORG Isola di PERSON , where his fingerprints were taken again on CARDINAL DATE and where he was registered as an asylum seeker .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG for ORG decided that the applicant was not entitled to the status of a recognised refugee , but that he met the requirements to obtain protection on humanitarian grounds . Thereupon , the applicant was granted leave to remain on humanitarian grounds and a travel document , both valid until DATE . According to the records of the authorities , the applicant left the reception centre of his own volition after he had collected his papers .", "CARDINAL . It seems that the applicant then left for GPE . On DATE GPE was requested by GPE to take the applicant back under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL c of ORG ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( \u201c FAC \u201d , hereinafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) . GPE accepted jurisdiction , and on DATE the applicant was transferred to GPE .", "CARDINAL . From CARDINAL DATE until DATE , the applicant was an inmate in a facility of the \u201c ORG per Richiedenti NORP e Rifugiati \u201d ( Protection System for Asylum Seekers and Refugees , hereinafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) , which he left voluntarily . According to the files , the applicant was staying on DATE at a residence belonging to ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON in GPE granted the applicant leave to remain on the basis of subsidiary protection , which was valid until DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant came to GPE and was taken into detention with a view to expulsion . On DATE he lodged an asylum claim in GPE . The applicant stated that he did not want to return to GPE , and that he would have been forced to sleep in the streets there and would not have had any access to financial subsistence , housing or food . He had had leave to remain in GPE on humanitarian grounds , but had returned his ORG card to the authorities because he wanted full asylum status . He explained that he was suffering from diabetes , asthma and a dust mite allergy , and had psychological problems .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesasylamt ) rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request and declared that GPE had jurisdiction regarding the asylum proceedings pursuant to LAW of LAW . It also ordered that the applicant be transferred to GPE . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims that he had severe medical and psychological problems . Referring to country reports on GPE it concluded that the applicant would have access to financial subsistence in GPE and that being sent there would not breach LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision . On DATE ORG ( Asylgerichtshof ) awarded suspensive effect to the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed the decision of ORG and ordered it to complement the country information on GPE in fresh proceedings , to make enquiries about what the applicant \u2019s residential status in GPE would be if he were returned there , and to establish further facts about the applicant \u2019s health .", "CARDINAL . Thereupon , on DATE , ORG contacted ORG in GPE and asked for information on what the applicant \u2019s residence status would be in GPE and if he would have access to the medication PERSON in GPE . It repeated and detailed its requests for information on DATE , on DATE and on CARDINAL DATE . ORG responded to the NORP authorities that asylum seekers and persons with subsidiary protection had access to subsistence and health support .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request pursuant to ORG and ordered the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE . Referring to country reports on GPE from DATE , DATE and DATE , it found that the \u201c ORG \u201d offered lodgings and other support for CARDINAL asylum seekers for the duration of DATE . There were also CARDINAL places in centres in which asylum seekers were supposed to stay for a maximum of DATE , although there were exceptions for vulnerable persons . Outside those structures , private initiatives and municipalities organised sleeping places and accommodation for asylum seekers . The reports also stated that asylum seekers had access to subsistence and medical support , at least at the preliminary examination stage . However , only after registration of an asylum request would an asylum seeker have a right to accommodation and subsistence . A \u201c GPE returner \u201d was requested to present himself before the PERSON for his or her legal status to be identified . Asylum seekers had to initially register with a health unit , after which they had access to medical treatment in public hospitals . However , asylum seekers without an address had difficulty in registering for medical treatment and subsistence . ORG also referred to the fact that the applicant had undergone a psychiatric examination in DATE that showed an \u201c adjustment disorder \u201d ( Anpassungsst\u00f6rung ) . Therapeutic consultations had been recommended . However , the applicant had not taken up the psychiatric treatment offered . It could not be shown that the applicant \u2019s mental health would worsen . In any event , the applicant would have access to subsistence if returned .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision . On DATE ORG again awarded suspensive effect to the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent an email to the association ORG informing them of the rejection of the applicant \u2019s asylum request in the first instance and of the pending guardianship proceedings ( see below , paragraphs CARDINAL ) in view of a possible removal of the applicant to GPE , in which case the association might wish to put in place \u201c appropriate safeguards \u201d . It also informed ORG of the pending guardianship proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as unfounded . It referred to ORG on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third - country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection , and of the content of the protection granted , to the Council Directive CARDINAL of DATE on minimum standards on procedures in Member GPE for granting and withdrawing refugee status , and to the Council Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of DATE laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers , which were all also applicable in respect of GPE , and concluded that GPE had an unobjectionable asylum practice and offered access to accommodation , subsistence and medical treatment for asylum seekers .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s representative \u2019s argument , claiming that the deadline for GPE to resume jurisdiction for the applicant \u2019s asylum proceedings had expired , it found that with the decision of suspensive effect taken on DATE the deadline had not expired , and that GPE had jurisdiction regarding the applicant \u2019s asylum claim .", "CARDINAL . ORG further stated that , in contrast to the situation in GPE , there was no recommendation from the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to refrain from removals to GPE , and that the overall reports did not show a comparable situation for asylum seekers with the one in GPE . With regard to the applicant \u2019s physical illnesses , it stated that he had access to the NORP health system . It stated that it had ordered ORG to contact the NORP authorities in the event of a transfer , to ensure that the applicant was welcomed in GPE and would receive the necessary medical help .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the critical report of the association ORG [ a NORP NGO ] from DATE about the situation of refugees in GPE , it alleged that the authors of that report worked in the field of counselling of refugees and had an agenda which favoured a critical approach to GPE as a host state . Furthermore , the situation of boat refugees in the south of GPE was not comparable to that of GPE - returners . With regard to the applicant \u2019s mental health , ORG stated again that he had access to treatment in GPE , referred to the ORG \u2019s case - law in that matter , and concluded that removal would not be in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court ( Verfassungsgerichtshof ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for legal aid on DATE , and refused to deal with his complaint due to lack of prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative applied to ORG ( GPE ) for guardianship proceedings to be initiated in respect of the applicant . He claimed that he had become aware of a severe aggravation of the applicant \u2019s mental health status during legal counselling , and that there was a risk that the applicant would not be able to pursue his asylum proceedings in his own best interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , and after an initial hearing on CARDINAL DATE , ORG appointed a provisional guardian for the applicant for the course of the guardianship proceedings and for representation in proceedings before authorities and courts , with particular regard to asylum proceedings . On DATE , FAC commissioned a psychiatric report on the applicant , to be submitted to the court within DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative supplied a power of attorney in which the applicant \u2019s guardian entrusted him to represent the applicant in the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG appointed a guardian for the applicant \u2019s representation before authorities and courts . It based its decision on an expert opinion that diagnosed the applicant with a severe psychological impairment whose clinical status display was comparable to florid paranoid schizophrenia . The applicant suffered from a bizarre delusion that absorbed his feeling and thinking . He was very irritable and completely occupied by a delusion that he was being pursued by NORP suffering from Aids . At least in the past the applicant had linked his psychotic status with hallucinations of being tortured and manipulated by spirits . The applicant was further the victim of hallucinations of a lioness as Satan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at the applicant \u2019s request , ordered ORG to reopen the applicant \u2019s proceedings . It referred at length to the psychiatric expert opinion obtained in the guardianship proceedings , which had further established that the applicant \u2019s psychotic symptoms had started in DATE or DATE and that the applicant claimed to have been suffering from psychological problems since DATE . The expert had also stated that as regards the applicant \u2019s fitness to be questioned his answers would be coloured by his psychotic status and that thus , he was not fit to be questioned , especially in the context of guardianship proceedings , asylum proceedings and his personal situation . Overall , the guardianship proceedings had shown that the applicant was not able to take care of his own affairs without the risk of suffering a disadvantage .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that in the former proceedings it had wrongly acted on the assumption that the applicant was legally capable ( proze\u00dff\u00e4hig ) to follow the proceedings adequately . ORG , again in the former proceedings , would have needed to either appoint a guardian for the applicant or to stay the proceedings until the guardianship proceedings before ORG had been concluded . It was not doubted that the applicant \u2019s psychological disorder was already manifest at the time of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , which was why the proceedings had had to be reopened . It stated further that because of the necessary further investigations and further interviews , ORG itself could not rule on the asylum request , possible subsidiary protection and a possible expulsion order . Therefore , the proceedings had to be continued by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The reopened asylum proceedings in GPE are still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG applied the interim measure under Rule CARDINAL and requested ORG to stay the applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE until further notice .", "CARDINAL . The relevant NORP and NORP law , instruments , principles and practice have only recently been exhaustively summarised , in PERSON v. the GPE and GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL , DATE . In the following , only information that is particularly relevant for the present case will be repeated .", "CARDINAL . Under the ORG , the member GPE must determine , on the basis of a hierarchy of objective criteria ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) , which member ORG bears responsibility for examining an asylum application lodged on their territory . The aim is to avoid multiple applications and to guarantee that each asylum seeker \u2019s case is dealt with by a single member ORG .", "CARDINAL . Where it is established that an asylum seeker has irregularly crossed the border into a member ORG , having come from a third country , the member ORG thus entered is responsible for examining the application for asylum ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . This responsibility ceases DATE after the date on which the irregular border crossing took place .", "CARDINAL . Where the criteria in the regulation indicate that another member ORG is responsible , that ORG is requested to take charge of the asylum seeker and examine the application for asylum ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . By way of derogation from the general rule , each member ORG may examine an application for asylum lodged with it by a third - country national , even if such an examination is not its responsibility under the criteria laid down in the Regulation ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . This is called the \u201c sovereignty \u201d clause . In such cases the ORG concerned becomes the member ORG responsible and assumes the obligations associated with that responsibility .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( Asylgesetz ) provides that an asylum application shall be rejected as inadmissible if , under treaty provisions or pursuant to LAW , another ORG has jurisdiction to examine the application for asylum . When rendering a decision rejecting an application , the authority shall specify which ORG has jurisdiction in the matter .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL establishes de facto protection against deportation ( faktischer PERSON ) for aliens who have lodged an application for asylum . However , section CARDINALa provides that a person whose asylum application has been rejected pursuant to lack of jurisdiction under LAW ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) is not entitled to such de - facto protection against deportation in the event that he or she lodges a second asylum application .", "CARDINAL . Again , reference is taken to the extensive description of the NORP asylum procedure and domestic law in PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In particular it is noted ( see ibid . , \u00a7 DATE ) that ORG for ORG can :", "- grant asylum by recognising the petitioner as a refugee within the meaning of the DATE LAW relating to ORG ;", "- not recognise the petitioner as a refugee but grant subsidiary protection under the terms of LAW DATE , on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third - country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) as implemented by LAW ( decreto legislativo ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ;", "- not grant asylum or subsidiary protection but grant leave to remain for compelling humanitarian reasons under the terms of LAW ( decreto legge ) nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and GPE ; or", "- not grant the petitioner any form of protection .", "CARDINAL . A person granted subsidiary protection will be given leave to remain with a validity of DATE , which can be renewed by ORG that granted it . This leave can further be converted into a residence permit for the purposes of work in GPE , provided this is requested before the expiry of the validity of the leave to remain , and provided the person concerned holds an identity document . Leave to remain granted for subsidiary protection entitles the person concerned , inter alia , to an NORP travel document , to work , to family reunion and to benefit from the general schemes for social assistance , health care , social housing and education under NORP domestic law .", "CARDINAL . A person granted leave to remain for compelling humanitarian reasons will be provided with a residence permit with a validity of DATE which can be converted into a residence permit for the purposes of work in GPE , provided the person concerned holds a passport . Leave to remain granted on humanitarian grounds entitles the person concerned to work , to health care and , if he or she has no passport , to an NORP travel document ( see ibid . , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
