CARDINAL , FAC , second floor . The fact of having handed over rent receipts accompanied by the letter of DATE or of not having replied to the appellant \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE can not be construed as meaning that a lease was in existence .

The equality of arms guaranteed both in LAW and in LAW was not ensured . Such inequality is all the more flagrant where the court dealing with the case has not taken the slightest account in its decision of statements made by a witness , even if heard purely for information purposes . This was a gross breach of the law , which expressly provides , even if it precludes taking the oath , that a spouse may testify and therefore implies that the court dealing with the case will consider that evidence . \"", "CARDINAL .

There was therefore nothing arbitrary in the instant case in not taking account of the explanations provided by PERSON . The appellant did not , moreover , show in what way the cantonal appellate court had unsustainably interpreted the statements made by the sworn witness PERSON . Contrary to what he appeared to be arguing , the court below did not infer from those statements that the witness had indicated to the appellant that he would have to leave the flat .
