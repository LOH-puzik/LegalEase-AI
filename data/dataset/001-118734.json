I asked for my lawyer , PERSON but the police told me that PERSON was a mafia lawyer and that he could not come ... I would like to add that when I was arrested the police told me that they needed me to give a statement . They knew I was soft and that I would sign everything they asked just to get out . That is how I signed this record , which was , as I said , drafted in another room ...", "I can answer the questions of the president of the trial panel by saying that I had a number of interviews with [ the police officer ] ORG but he told me that this would never become part of a case file and he told me the same thing for this [ statement ] . However , since [ K.A. ] did not want to call my lawyer PERSON , he called this other lawyer who never gave me any advice . He just told me that he had signed the record and that I could do whatever I wanted . I have to say that [ this lawyer ] was a woman . Nothing I said in that statement is true ... except the part in which I said that I was an addict . ... The only true information [ in that statement ] is my personal details and the fact that I was an addict but [ the police officer ] already knew that . The part where I said that I was not in withdrawal was absolutely not true ...", "I have known K.A. for DATE , he has arrested me on a number of occasions and he once lodged a criminal complaint against me . Once he also threatened me that if I did not tell him something , he would lodge a criminal complaint , which he had previously prepared against me , but that never happened . He tolerated my [ heroin ] addiction but asked me to tell him from whom I was buying drugs , and sometimes would tell him . Sometimes I would tell him the truth but mostly not , I was trying to gain time . ... I trusted [ K.A. ] when he brought me that record and told me to sign it and that everything would be all right , that I could go . Therefore I signed it .", "As to the questions put by [ the accused ] I can answer that when I was in the police [ station ] the only thing that was important for me was to get out and to get myself a heroin fix , or methadone , which I was just going to pick up when the police arrested me . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In [ the police station ] the ill - treatment started immediately . CARDINAL or QUANTITY police officers , whom I did not know , told me to spread my legs and put my hands behind my back with my head pressed against the wall . Whenever somebody passed by me I was kicked , and when I fell they kicked me on the ground . They were jumping all over me . This lasted for some time and then they started to negotiate , asking me to give a statement . I asked for lawyers GPE or S.B. but they told me as regards [ lawyer ORG ] \u2018 why do you need that ORG and also that [ lawyer PERSON ] would not come . The ill - treatment ... started again and then [ police officers ] [ K.]A. and [ PERSON came . They told me that they were good policemen and asked me to give a statement .

It is not true what was written , that I was not in withdrawal . I was , and the policeman waved the heptaton in front of my eyes . They were showing me the drugs .

I do n\u2019t remember but I do n\u2019t think I ever signed a power of attorney for him .", "The record was written previously , and not while the lawyer was there . In the presence of the lawyer I was just confirming what was written in the record and then I signed it .

At the same hearing another co - accused , ORG , testified that while he had been in police custody he had heard police officers beating and interrogating GPE for TIME .", "CARDINAL . After the accused had given evidence the applicant \u2019s defence lawyer asked for the records of the oral statements given to the police by GPE , ORG and GPE to be excluded from the case file as evidence obtained unlawfully . The defence lawyers of the other co - accused made the same request .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the trial court dismissed their requests , on the grounds that the records of the statements given to the police did not reveal any reason to exclude them from the case file .", "CARDINAL . At the same hearing ORG added that he had been told by policeman PERSON that they wanted to put the applicant in prison for DATE or kill him . PERSON and ORG reiterated that their statements given to the police had been a result of withdrawal symptoms and crisis .", "CARDINAL . In their closing argument , the applicant \u2019s defence lawyers argued that the only evidence against the applicant was the statements of his co - accused , which had been made to the police under duress and pressure . They asked for the applicant to be acquitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , and imposed a confiscation order on him in the amount of CARDINAL NORP kunas ( HRK ) .", "CARDINAL . The Zagreb County Court based the applicant \u2019s conviction solely on the statements ORG , ORG and GPE had made to the police . In addition it considered that witness PERSON had also testified that he had transported QUANTITY of heroin to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . As to the lawfulness and probative value of the records of oral statements given to the police by ORG , ORG and GPE , that court noted :", "\u201c The request to exclude the record of the statement made by the fourth accused , ORG , to the police on DATE , made by the defence lawyer of the fourth accused ORG , on the ground that when giving the statement [ ORG ] had been undergoing withdrawal from heroin , was dismissed . [ The record of his statement ] does not reveal any suspicion that [ ORG ] was in withdrawal . Moreover , there was a defence lawyer present during his questioning who did not have any objection as to the manner of the questioning . This record does not reveal any circumstances which could raise the suspicion that the questioning of the fourth accused ORG by the police on DATE had been unlawful ...", "It was also requested that the records of the statements given to the police by the third accused ORG , the fourth accused , ORG , and the eleventh accused , GPE , be excluded from the case file on the ground that these statements were made under duress and that as such they could not be used in the proceedings . The records referred to do not reveal any circumstances which could raise the suspicion that the statements had been made under coercion or pressure . The defence lawyers were present during the questioning and they did not have any objections . ... There is nothing credible to support the suspicion that the records referred to were obtained unlawfully , and therefore the request for their exclusion was dismissed ...", "Statements by the third accused , ORG , the fourth accused , ORG , and the eleventh accused , GPE , made to the police in the presence of their defence lawyers , are accepted by this court as they are clear , specific and precise . These statements support each other , they have a number of details which could obviously be known only from personal experience ( particularly the details of how they contacted the first accused , PERSON , and how the drugs were distributed and hidden ) ... The statements these accused made during the trial , where they tried to show that their previous statements were a result of unlawful treatment by the police ( threats , ploys , ill - treatment ) , are not accepted by this court , as their aim is to avoid criminal responsibility .", "Moreover , the records of the police interviews do not contain any element capable of placing their lawfulness in question . This court is not persuaded that various unlawful aspects [ of the police questioning ] alleged by ORG did not provoke any reaction by the accused , who argued that [ any reaction ] would have been futile . These allegations were made DATE after the events concerned had taken place and are therefore not credible and are an obvious fabrication aimed at avoiding criminal responsibility . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged appeals with ORG against the first - instance judgment . He argued , inter alia , that his conviction had been based solely on the statements made to police by his co - accused , although that had been evidence obtained unlawfully , as his co - accused had been ill - treated by police during the questioning . Moreover , they had been heroin addicts and at the time of the questioning were going through withdrawal .", "CARDINAL . He further complained that the first - instance court had failed to hear the defence lawyers who had allegedly been present during the police questioning , and the police officers who had questioned his co - accused . In a situation in which his co - accused had raised the issue of coercion and illtreatment during the police questioning , and in view of the fact that they had incriminated not only themselves but also him , the trial court had been obliged to check their testimony . As to the statement of witnesses PERSON , the applicant pointed out that this witness had never said that the person he knew as \u201c PERSON \u201d was the applicant .", "DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It upheld the findings of ORG that there was no evidence in the case file to suggest anything unlawful in the records of interviews with the police by the applicant \u2019s co - accused . ORG pointed out that they had been questioned in the presence of the defence lawyers and that there was nothing to indicate any withdrawal symptoms , coercion or oppression . ORG also added :", "\u201c The psychiatric expert ORG found that in DATE [ ORG ] , as an addict , had a high tolerance of heroin , but [ the expert ] did not say that he was experiencing a withdrawal crisis , which [ the expert ] reiterated at the hearing . The defence had no questions ...", "There was not a single piece of evidence , including the report drawn up by psychiatric expert ORG , to suggest that [ I.G.H. ] had been unable to understand the consequence of his actions , and particularly that he was unable to testify before the relevant authorities , regardless of his heroin addiction and diminished mental capacity at the time the offence was committed . Equally , there is not a single piece of evidence that the accused ORG , and GPE ... , on account of their heroin addiction , were unable to understand the nature of their actions or to testify before the authorities . ... \u201c", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) against the above judgment on DATE , reiterating his previous arguments .", "CARDINAL .
