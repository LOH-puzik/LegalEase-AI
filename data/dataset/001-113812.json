They may be used only after all other possibilities have been exhausted . Any decision to restrain the patient must be sufficiently grounded . Restraint can not be used to facilitate treatment or to deal with a restless patient . Potential causes of problematic behaviour , for example , pain , discomfort , side effects of medicinal products , stress , interpersonal problems between the caregivers and the patient , or other illnesses must always be identified . The use of measures of restraint is justified only if a removable cause of the patient \u2019s behaviour can not be found or in situations when the risk arising from the patient \u2019s behaviour is unacceptably high . The benefit of the use of restraining means must outweigh the risks ...", "CARDINAL .

In any psychiatric establishment , the restraint of agitated and/or violent patients may on occasion be necessary . This is an area of particular concern to the ORG , given the potential for abuse and ill - treatment .", "The restraint of patients should be the subject of a clearly - defined policy . That policy should make clear that initial attempts to restrain agitated or violent patients should , as far as possible , be non - physical ( e.g. verbal instruction ) and that where physical restraint is necessary , it should in principle be limited to manual control .", "Staff in psychiatric establishments should receive training in both non - physical and manual control techniques vis - \u00e0 - vis agitated or violent patients . The possession of such skills will enable staff to choose the most appropriate response when confronted by difficult situations , thereby significantly reducing the risk of injuries to patients and staff .", "CARDINAL . Resort to instruments of physical restraint ( straps , strait - jackets , etc . ) shall only very rarely be justified and must always be either expressly ordered by a doctor or immediately brought to the attention of a doctor with a view to seeking his approval . If , exceptionally , recourse is had to instruments of physical restraint , they should be removed at the earliest opportunity ; they should never be applied , or their application prolonged , as a punishment ...", "CARDINAL . Every instance of the physical restraint of a patient ( manual control , use of instruments of physical restraint , seclusion ) should be recorded in a specific register established for this purpose ( as well as in the ORG", "This will greatly facilitate both the management of such incidents and the oversight of the extent of their occurrence . \u201d", "\u201c Means of restraint in psychiatric establishments for adults Extract from DATE ORG [ ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ]", "CARDINAL .

However , the delegation found that the entries were not always meticulously kept ; the release time and , on occasion , the moment of application of the immobilisation were not recorded .", "As indicated above ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL ) , in the ORG \u2019s view , patients who are immobilised should always be subject to continuous , direct personal supervision by a member of staff . However , the delegation was told that a pilot project on ward CARDINAL to have patients accompanied by a member of staff for the full duration of the immobilisation had failed due to a lack of staff .
