At the relevant time he was the chairman of a branch of the applicant association .", "CARDINAL . The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden was founded on DATE . Its aims , according to its statute and programme , were to \u201c unite all NORP in GPE on a regional and cultural basis \u201d and to achieve \u201c the recognition of the NORP minority in GPE \u201d . Sections CARDINAL and QUANTITY of the statute stated that the organisation would not infringe the territorial integrity of GPE and that it \u201c would not use violent , brutal , inhuman or unlawful means \u201d .", "According to the ORG submissions before the ORG , the main activity of the applicant association was the organisation of celebrations to commemorate historical events of importance for NORP in GPE . Over an unspecified period it published a newspaper .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON applied for , but was refused , registration . In the proceedings for registration ORG and ORG examined the statute of the association , its programme and other written evidence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In their decisions of DATE and DATE and DATE the courts found that the applicant association \u2019s aims were directed against the unity of the nation , that it advocated national and ethnic hatred , and that it was dangerous for the territorial integrity of GPE . Therefore , its registration would be contrary to Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY of the LAW of DATE , as in force at the time . In particular , the aims of the association included , inter alia , the \u201c political development of GPE \u201d and the establishment of a \u201c united , independent NORP State \u201d . Moreover , in its appeal to ORG the association had stated that \u201c the NORP people would not accept NORP , NORP or NORP rule \u201d . The formal declaration in the applicant association \u2019s statute that it would not infringe the territorial integrity of GPE , appeared inconsistent with the remaining material .", "CARDINAL . The judgment of ORG of DATE stated , inter alia :", "\u201c [ T]he lower courts correctly established that the aims of the [ applicant association ] under its statute and programme were directed against the unity of the nation ... [ The material in the case ] demonstrates that the [ applicant association ] seeks to disseminate the ideas of ORG among the NORP population , especially in a particular geographical area . [ Those ideas ] presuppose the \u2018 GPE of the NORP population and its conversion into a NORP population ... It follows that the [ applicant association ] is directed against the unity of the nation and is therefore prohibited under LAW of the [ DATE ] LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

According to a police report , drawn up in DATE by the director of the police in the region and submitted to ORG , \u201c fierce anti - NORP declarations \u201d had been made at the meetings of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . In particular , on DATE a declaration requesting the recognition of a NORP minority and cultural autonomy had been read out . The report did not mention any incident at that meeting .", "As explained in the report , on DATE CARDINAL ORG supporters had gathered during the official commemoration of the death of PERSON , which had been attended by CARDINAL participants . Members of Ilinden , standing on a separate platform , had allegedly hissed and booed the police , labelled the NORP \u201c barbarians \u201d , \u201c conquerors \u201d and \u201c enslavers \u201d and called on them to leave and \u201c free \u201d the region from their presence . The report further stated that a \u201c shocking \u201d incident had occurred : PERSON , a prominent politician , had been splashed with beer on his face . The police had allegedly prevented any further clashes .", "The report concluded :", "\u201c ... the events organised by ORG are provocative . There is a real risk of incidents . For that reason , since DATE the municipalities in the region normally refuse to allow such events to proceed . With a view to protecting the law , the assistance of the prosecuting authorities and of the police is normally sought . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted copies of photographs , written testimonies and statements of persons who claimed that on several occasions DATE there had been police actions and acts of private individuals obstructing the activities of the applicant association .", "They also submitted copies of newspaper articles accusing ORG of misappropriating NORP national symbols , describing its leaders as uneducated , mentally ill or traitors , and denying the existence of a NORP minority in GPE . The applicants alleged that those articles reflected public opinion in GPE , as manipulated by the authorities .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON , as chairman of the PERSON branch of the applicant association , requested the mayor of ORG to authorise a meeting in the area of Samuilova krepost , to be held on DATE in commemoration of a historical event . On DATE permission was refused by the mayor , but no reasons were given . The applicant association appealed to ORG which dismissed the appeal on DATE . ORG found that since the applicant association had been banned , there were well - founded fears that the demonstration would endanger public order and the rights and freedoms of others .", "On DATE Mr PERSON , the representative of the applicant association , and another person were issued with written warnings by the police to stay away from the official traditional fair at PERSON krepost . The warnings stated that they were based on the applicable law .", "CARDINAL . NORP Despite the refusal of the authorities , on DATE some members of the applicant association ( CARDINAL according to the applicants\u2019 assessment ) attempted to approach the historical site of PERSON krepost but the police , who according to the applicants were heavily armed , blocked their way .", "In the ORG \u2019s submission , the allegation that the area had been sealed off was \u201c manifestly ill - founded \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant association requested the mayor of PERSON to authorise a meeting to be held on DATE at the grave of PERSON at FAC , on the occasion of the eightieth anniversary of his death .", "This was refused on DATE as the applicant association was not duly registered by the courts . On DATE the applicant association appealed to ORG stating , inter alia , that the NORP people had been deprived of their right to their own cultural life in violation of international law . ORG never examined the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipality of PERSON held an official ceremony to mark the anniversary of PERSON death . The event took place at his grave at FAC . The ceremony commenced at TIME", "The applicants submitted that a group of their supporters who had travelled to ORG on DATE had been ordered by the police to leave their cars in the nearby town of ORG and had been transported to the monastery by local buses . There they had been allowed to visit the grave , to lay a wreath and to light candles . However , they had not been allowed to bring to the site the placards , banners and musical instruments which they were carrying , or to make speeches at the grave . The police had allegedly taken away the ribbon attached to the wreath . The participants had then celebrated the event , without music , near the monastery but away from the grave .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , as in DATE , the applicant association again requested authorisation to hold a commemorative meeting on DATE at PERSON krepost , the historical site in the vicinity of PERSON . On DATE the mayor of ORG refused the request without giving any reason . Upon the applicant association \u2019s appeal the refusal was upheld by judgment of ORG of DATE . ORG found that the \u201c holding of a commemorative meeting of GPE on DATE at ORG krepost would endanger public order \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant association informed the mayor of PERSON and the local police that they were organising a meeting to be held on DATE at FAC to commemorate the death of PERSON . It stated in a letter to the mayor that PERSON , who is considered in GPE as a NORP national hero , was in fact a \u201c NORP fighter for the national independence of GPE from NORP rule and against the NORP oppressors \u201d .", "On DATE the mayor refused to grant permission . He stated that permission for the commemoration of the same historical event had been requested on DATE by the director of the local high school . The mayor further explained that the commemoration would be organised jointly by the school and the municipality and that \u201c every [ person ] , individually , could come \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Ilinden appealed to ORG against the mayor \u2019s refusal stating , inter alia , that the mayor had not allowed them , \u201c as a separate ethnic community \u201d , to organise a meeting at the tomb of their national hero .", "On DATE the President of ORG issued an order refusing to examine the appeal on the merits as it had been submitted on behalf of an unregistered organisation .", "CARDINAL . The date on which that order was notified to the applicant association is unclear . The applicants initially denied having received a response to their appeal , but in later submissions to the ORG stated that on DATE they had become aware of the order of DATE .", "CARDINAL . As the defects in the appeal were not remedied within the statutory DATE time - limit , on CARDINAL DATE the President of ORG ordered the discontinuance of the proceedings . That order was notified to the applicant association on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants claimed that on DATE the police had prevented a group of their supporters from approaching FAC and that QUANTITY persons had been ill - treated . They submitted that on DATE CARDINAL students and CARDINAL teachers from the local high school had arrived at FAC . The students had laid a wreath in the presence of the police and had left TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , as chairman of the association \u2019s branch in GPE , requested authorisation for a commemorative meeting to be held on DATE at Samuilova krepost , in the outskirts of GPE . On DATE the mayor refused the request , stating that the applicant association was not \u201c a legitimate organisation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant association appealed to ORG against the refusal of the mayor stating , inter alia , that there was no legal provision prohibiting meetings of organisations which were not \u201c legitimate \u201d and that the planned public event would be peaceful and would not endanger public order .", "By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on the merits . It found that the applicant association was not duly registered \u201c in accordance with the laws of the country \u201d and that it had not been shown that the persons who had acted on its behalf actually represented it . As a result , it had been unclear who had organised the event and who would be responsible for order during the meeting under the terms of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . ORG concluded that the lack of clarity as regards the organisers of a public event endangered public order and the rights and freedoms of others .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that on DATE the police had not allowed a group of supporters of the applicant association to reach the historical site in the vicinity of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The parties made submissions and presented copies of documents concerning the activities of the applicant association .", "It appears that some of the documents relied upon by the Government concern statements of persons adhering to a faction or a branch of the applicant association . Those groups apparently differed in their views and activities .", "CARDINAL . The Government relied on the declaration of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on the police report concerning the meetings of DATE and DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and on other material .", "The Government submitted that during meetings , in letters to institutions or in statements to the media , persons associated with the applicant association and its supporters had made declarations to the effect that they wanted the NORP to leave the region of GPE and stated that there could be \u201c no peace in the LOC unless the NORP , the NORP and all others recognise the national rights of the NORP people and no democracy in any NORP country without such recognition \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted copies of several issues of Vestnik za ORG v ORG i PERSON and ORG poshta , pamphlets published by CARDINAL of the factions linked to the applicant association , and copies of press material . These contain information , inter alia , about a \u201c secret \u201d private meeting of a faction of the applicant association held on DATE . The meeting allegedly declared that on CARDINAL DATE the region of GPE would become \u201c politically , economically and culturally autonomous \u201d or independent . That was so because on DATE , DATE after LAW of DATE , GPE Parties to it were allegedly under obligation to withdraw from the \u201c enslaved \u201d NORP territories .", "ORG poshta further invited all NORP to a march in GPE on DATE . The invitation stressed that the participants should not carry arms .", "CARDINAL . A handwritten poster , allegedly issued by followers of the applicant association in GPE , called for a boycott of the DATE parliamentary election \u201c to prevent the establishment of legitimate NORP authorities in the region \u201d of GPE . The document further called for a united NORP State and for \u201c an international invasion \u201d by ORG of the ORG \u201c according to the model of GPE , GPE and GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . An appeal for a boycott of the DATE election stated that the NORP should abstain from voting in protest against the lack of recognition of their rights as a minority .", "CARDINAL . In a declaration published in the press in the Former GPE , the leaders of a faction linked to the applicant association criticised the NORP authorities for their refusal to recognise the NORP language and the NORP minority in GPE and appealed to various international organisations to exert pressure on the NORP authorities in this respect .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted a copy of a \u201c memorandum \u201d addressed to ORG , signed by activists of the applicant association or a faction of it , dated DATE . It contains a short overview of historical events , complaints about the attitude of the NORP authorities and the following main demands : collective minority rights , access to ORG archives , the return of confiscated material , the revision of the way NORP history is seen , the revision of international treaties of DATE and DATE , the dissolution of the \u201c political police \u201d , the dissolution of nationalistic and violent parties and organisations , the registration of GPE as the legitimate organisation of the NORP in GPE , radio broadcasts in NORP , an investigation into violations committed against NORP and economic assistance .", "The document also stated :", "\u201c ... being conscious of the contemporary economic and political realities in the LOC , LOC and the world , we are not acting through confrontation , tension or violence . Our way to achieve enjoyment of our rights as a NORP ethnic minority in GPE and in GPE , where our ethnic and historical roots lie , is through peaceful means and negotiations ...", "Our peaceful and lawful means ... are to the advantage of the authorities who ... deny the existence of a NORP minority . Our democratic ways are to our detriment : the authorities can afford political , economic and psychological pressure , and arms . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Before ORG relied on a judgment of ORG of DATE in a case concerning the constitutionality of a political party , ORG : ORG ( \u201c UMOIPIRIN \u201d ) , which had been registered by the competent courts in DATE . ORG found that that party \u2019s aims were directed against the territorial integrity of the country and that therefore it was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that GPE could be regarded as a successor to or a continuation of the applicant association . On that basis ORG relied extensively on submissions about the history and the activities of the applicant association in the assessment of the question whether GPE was constitutional .", "In particular , ORG took note of the demands made in the declaration of the applicant association of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It also observed that maps of the region , depicting parts of NORP and NORP territory as NORP , had been published by the association and that there had been repeated calls for autonomy and even secession . ORG further noted that representatives of the applicant association had made offensive remarks about the NORP nation .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court thus found that the applicant association and ORG considered the region of GPE as a territory which was only temporarily under NORP control and would soon become independent . Their activities were therefore directed against the territorial integrity of the country and were as such prohibited under LAW . The prohibition was in conformity with LAW , there being no doubt that an activity against the territorial integrity of the country endangered its national security .", "The judgment was adopted by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL . The dissenting judges gave separate opinions which have not been published .", "CARDINAL . In support of this allegation the Government have submitted copies of CARDINAL documents .", "CARDINAL . The first is a copy of an article from the Kontinent DATE newspaper , dated DATE . The newspaper stated that a Mr D.P.K. had been arrested in GPE for having threatened police officers with blowing up their homes , as they had impeded his business . During the arrest the police had allegedly discovered explosives in Mr D.P.K. \u2019s home . The short article went on to recall that PERSON D.P.K. was allegedly a leader of ORG and a \u201c NORP activist \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The second document appears to be a photocopy of a flyer announcing the founding of an organisation and inviting those interested to join . The document bears no signature . It dates allegedly from DATE and appears to have been typed on a typewriter .", "The flyer explained that the newly created ORG did not wish to replace ORG . It criticised certain leaders of the applicant association .", "The flyer further stated that the new organisation would form armed groups with the aim of \u201c helping GPE to survive \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government have not provided any comment or additional information on the contents of the CARDINAL documents submitted by them .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing before the ORG , in response to a question put to her , the Government \u2019s Agent declared that no criminal proceedings relevant to the present case had ever been brought against members of the applicant association .", "CARDINAL . The Government stressed that knowledge of the historical context and of the current situation in GPE and in the LOC was essential for the understanding of the issues in the present case . Their explanation may be summarised as follows .", "\u201c Historically , the NORP nation consolidated within several geographical regions , CARDINAL of them being the geographical region of GPE . In DATE , when GPE was partially liberated from NORP dominance , FAC left the region of GPE within the borders of GPE . DATE the NORP population of GPE organised CARDINAL unsuccessful uprisings seeking liberation from NORP rule and union with GPE . There followed massive refugee migrations from the region to the NORP motherland . CARDINAL of NORP settled in GPE .", "In DATE the so - called \u2018 NORP nation\u2019 was proclaimed for the first time by a resolution of ORG . Before that no reliable historical source had ever mentioned any NORP population in the region other than the NORP population . After the Second World War the NORP power in GPE proclaimed the concept of a separate NORP nation . A separate language and alphabet were created and imposed by decree of DATE . A massive assimilation campaign accompanied by brutalities was launched in GPE . For a short period of time ORG \u2013 inspired by the idea of creating a NORP - Yugoslav federation \u2013 also initiated a campaign of forcible imposition of a \u2018 ORG identity on the population in the region of LOC . In the DATE and DATE censuses individuals living in that region were forced to declare themselves \u2018 Macedonians\u2019 . The campaign was abandoned in DATE , partly due to the refusal of the population to change their identity .", "In those parts of the geographical region of GPE which were in GPE the realities of the bi - polar cold - war world \u2013 where the relations between GPE and the socialist block dominated by the GPE were tense \u2013 exacerbated the population \u2019s feeling of doom and exasperation and their fear that unification with GPE proper would never be possible . The forcible imposition of a NORP identity by the PERSON regime also played a decisive role .", "Therefore , even if a process of formation of a new nation has taken place , it was limited to the territory of the Former GPE .", "In the DATE census , CARDINAL NORP citizens identified themselves as NORP and indicated NORP as their mother tongue . Another CARDINAL declared themselves NORP in the geographical sense , while allegedly indicating their NORP national conscience and mother tongue .", "Individuals considering themselves NORP are far from being discriminated against in GPE .
