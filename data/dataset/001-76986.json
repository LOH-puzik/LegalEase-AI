BULGARIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Ms M. Karadjova , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant entered into an employment agreement with a private insurance company ( \u201c the defendant \u201d ) under which she was appointed to the position of chief accountant of its branch office in the town of ORG .", "On DATE the executive director of the company issued an order for terminating the applicant \u2019s employment agreement on the grounds that she did not meet the requirements for the position . The order was not immediately served on the applicant .", "Despite the fact that the applicant was on sick leave between DATE and DATE , the order for terminating her employment agreement was served on her on DATE and , thus , her employment was terminated .", "On DATE the applicant initiated an action against the defendant for unlawful dismissal and argued , inter alia , that she satisfied the requirements for the position and that her employment agreement could not have been terminated while she was on sick leave . She sought both reinstatement to her previous position and damages .", "ORG conducted CARDINAL hearings between DATE and DATE during which time it obtained an expert \u2019s opinion in respect of the damages suffered by the applicant . At the hearings of CARDINAL DATE and DATE the defendant objected to the court \u2019s jurisdiction in the case . The first objection was rejected , but the second was upheld after the defendant presented evidence that its ORG branch office had in the meantime been closed on CARDINAL DATE . ORG found that the court at the seat of the defendant had jurisdiction following the said closure of the branch office and transferred the case to GPE .", "In a decision of DATE GPE , in camera , found that it did not have jurisdiction in the case and forwarded the case file to ORG to make a final determination on the matter .", "In a decision of DATE ORG , in camera , ruled that GPE had jurisdiction in the case and transferred the case file back to it . The parties to the proceedings were informed of the decision on DATE . The case was then transferred to GPE which received it on DATE .", "The GPE ORG conducted CARDINAL hearings on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the first of which was postponed due to the improper summoning of the applicant .", "In a judgment of DATE the ORG found partially in favour of the applicant and declared her dismissal unlawful , but dismissed her claims for reinstatement and damages . The defendant and the applicant appealed against the judgment on DATE , respectively .", "On DATE the defendant was instructed to deposit the corresponding court fees for its appeal , which it did on DATE . Its appeal and that of the applicant were then registered with ORG on DATE .", "The first hearing of the parties\u2019 appeals was scheduled for DATE , but ORG postponed it for unspecified reasons to DATE . At the hearing of that date , the court instructed the applicant to present the original of her work booklet so as to verify the accuracy of the certified photocopies presented to the court in respect of her subsequent employment and adjourned the hearing . The next hearing was conducted on DATE , when the case was declared ready for decision .", "In a judgment of DATE the ORG quashed part of the first - instance court judgment in the case and instead reinstated the applicant to her former position and awarded her damages . The court \u2019s finding in favour of the applicant was based on the fact that she had been dismissed while she was on sick leave , which negated the need to examine in substance the grounds of her dismissal and whether she in fact met the requirements for the position . Neither party appealed against the judgment , so it entered into force on DATE , at the latest ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
