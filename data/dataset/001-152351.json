BULGARIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions)", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Guido Raimondi;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON is an heir of Mr M. and Mr PERSON is an heir of PERSON PERSON is entitled to CARDINAL of the inheritance of PERSON , and PERSON PERSON to CARDINAL ninth of the inheritance of PERSON The applicants\u2019 CARDINAL predecessors were co - owners of an afforested island in the GPE , currently named GPE , measuring , at the time of expropriation , QUANTITY . PERSON owned another afforested island measuring QUANTITY and other forestry land on the shores of the GPE , QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . The above - mentioned land was nationalised in DATE .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the GPE \u2019s fluvial activity over DATE , GPE island \u2019s area has increased and it currently measures QUANTITY . The second island no longer exists .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the adoption of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , PERSON and Mr PERSON \u2019s mother , whom Mr PERSON later succeeded , applied for the restitution of their ORG forests and forestry land .", "CARDINAL . By CARDINAL decisions of DATE the ORG land commission acknowledged that the heirs of PERSON and PERSON had the right to restitution or compensation . Finding that actual restitution was impossible because the forests had become \u201c exclusive ORG property \u201d ( \u201c \u0438\u0437\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u044a\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the commission decided that the heirs would receive compensation bonds . Those decisions were served on the applicants on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , legislative amendments entered into force repealing the provisions allowing the award of compensation bonds for properties falling under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and providing for a sole means of compensation , namely in the form of equivalent State - own land .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the GPE district where the forests belonging to the applicants\u2019 predecessors had been situated there was insufficient Stateowned land to compensate the applicants and the remaining heirs . In a letter dated DATE ORG therefore instructed the relevant authorities in the neighbouring GPE district to identify appropriate land .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL decisions of DATE ORG allotted to the heirs of PERSON a plot of QUANTITY , and to the heirs of PERSON a plot of QUANTITY in the GPE district .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants applied for judicial review of those decisions , arguing that the allotted land and the forests were not equivalent to the ones their predecessors had owned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the GPE ORG gave a judgment in the proceedings brought by Mr PERSON . Noting that the land and the forests allotted by way of compensation to the heirs of Mr M. were not equivalent to those owned by him in the past , it quashed the respective decision of ORG of DATE . Furthermore , on the basis of an expert report commissioned by it , ORG observed that there were appropriate forests in the area of the village of PERSON in the adjacent Varshets district . It thus remitted the case for a fresh examination with a view to allotting land in the specified area to the heirs .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was not appealed against and entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a new decision dated CARDINAL DATE ORG ( former ORG ) refused to allot the land in the GPE district to the heirs of PERSON , reasoning that the ORG - owned forests in that area were not sufficient and that the compensation should be provided in the neighbouring ORG district .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date Mr PERSON challenged that decision before ORG . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE that court declared the decision null and void as it contradicted the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It noted , in addition , that it had already been established that there were no appropriate forests in the PERSON district . On the basis of expert reports commissioned by it , ORG identified in the adjacent districts CARDINAL different plots that were suitable to be provided to the heirs of PERSON , and acknowledged their right to receive those plots as compensation .", "CARDINAL . That judgment does not appear to have been appealed against and entered into force on an unspecified date .", "CARDINAL . NORP In execution of the judgment , in CARDINAL decisions given in DATE and DATE the ORG and ORG allotted to the heirs of PERSON several plots of forestry land measuring QUANTITY in total .", "CARDINAL . NORP In their submissions dated DATE the Government assured the ORG that the adoption of decisions transferring the remaining land to the heirs of PERSON was imminent .", "CARDINAL . In the judicial - review proceedings brought by Mr PERSON against the respective decision of ORG of DATE , ORG issued a judgment on DATE . It found that the land allotted as compensation to the heirs of PERSON was indeed of manifestly lower quality than the CARDINAL previously owned by her . It also found that in the area of the village of PERSON in the adjacent Varshets district , there was a plot of forestry land which was equivalent in quality to those previously owned by PERSON and was even bigger in size . It thus quashed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , acknowledged that the heirs of PERSON had the right to part of the bigger plot as compensation , and held that it was for the local ORG to apportion the allotted land .", "CARDINAL . That judgment was not appealed against and entered into force on an unspecified date .", "CARDINAL . During the applicants\u2019 ensuing contacts with the authorities it became clear that the afforested area indicated in the judgment of DATE was within the territory of the \u201c LOC \u201d natural park and as such was public property ; thus it could not be provided as compensation to the heirs of PERSON That was pointed out in CARDINAL letters sent to the applicants , dated respectively CARDINAL DATE and DATE , by ORG and the administration of ORG .", "CARDINAL . It appears that for DATE after that , the authorities made no effort to enforce the judgment of DATE or to identify other land to be provided to the heirs of PERSON Not until DATE did a commission consisting of members of different State bodies , appointed by the head of ORG in GPE , identify CARDINAL plots of land in the adjacent districts , measuring QUANTITY , which could be provided as compensation to the heirs of PERSON", "CARDINAL . In their submissions dated DATE the Government pointed out that the process would continue , and that the identification of the remaining plots to be transferred to the heirs was imminent ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
