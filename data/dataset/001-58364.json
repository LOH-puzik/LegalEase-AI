However , on the basis of all the information concerning police violence in GPE received from various sources by ORG , it believes that the nature and the extent of police violence are far more serious than seems to be generally believed . On the strength of the evidence as a whole , the ORG assumes that the real extent hardly differs from the CARDINAL researchers\u2019 estimates .

PERSON point in using this expression has been , inter alia , to expose a deliberate or negligent denial of the existence of police brutality . Such denial is a prerequisite for the occurrence of police brutality on an appreciable scale .", "The word despotism has also been mentioned . In the manner it is used in the preface to PERSON book it is not linked to the GPE police force ... The fact that the use of words such as \u2018 despotism\u2019 probably contributed to raising the temperature and the general noise level of the debate may be relevant to the assessment of the lawfulness [ of the impugned statements ] . Having regard to the entire context , however , I can not see that PERSON choice of words or manner of presentation of his views either in \u2018 Police Brutality\u2019 or in connection with the commercialisation of the book can justify calling into question his integrity as was done in the statements under consideration .", "It is noted that the appellants have forcefully submitted that their statements were made in their capacity as representatives of the police and that , as such , they must enjoy a particular protection against their statements being declared null and void . I agree that it was natural for PERSON and PERSON as representatives to look after the interests of the police officers in the debate . As I have already mentioned , their freedom of expression should be protected to the same extent as the freedom of those who direct the attention towards possible questionable circumstances within the police force . But , as already pointed out , there is a limit also in respect of them . That limit has been overstepped in this case .", "Accordingly , I conclude along with ORG that statements CARDINAL , CARDINAL must be declared null and void .", "I will now turn to PERSON statements ...", "[ Statement CARDINAL ] ... directly assails the honesty of PERSON motives . That this is what is being questioned is reinforced when the statement is read in the context of the whole article ...", "I therefore agree with ORG that statement CARDINAL must be declared null and void ...", "...", "Statement CARDINAL is tantamount to an assertion that allegations of police brutality are being fabricated and then made public . In this , there clearly lies a statement to the effect that the published material is being tampered with . The statement appears in close connection with PERSON and must at any rate be perceived as applying also to him ...", "... I therefore conclude that statement CARDINAL but not statement CARDINAL must be declared null and void ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a concurring opinion Mr Justice PERSON stated , inter alia :", "\u201c I have reached the same conclusion and I agree on the essential points of the reasoning . However , for my part I have reached this conclusion with considerable doubts as to whether the appellants\u2019 statements were unlawful , having regard to the circumstances in which they were made . The basis for my doubts is as follows :", "[ Mr Justice PERSON ] pointed out that in a public debate on \u2018 matters of public concern\u2019 ... the threshold for what the participants may state without being found liable for defamation should be very high . Even if this is accepted , I agree that it should not legitimise attacks directed against the opponent \u2019s personal integrity , or which devalue or throw suspicion on his motives for participating in the debate .", "...", "For my part , I find it hard to see how the statements which ORG ... declared null and void could be said to have been particularly directed against Mr Bratholm as a private individual . But I shall leave that aside , since I consider that in a heated public debate attacking another person \u2019s integrity and motives instead of what the person has stated must be deemed unlawful as such .", "What in particular causes a problem for me is that \u2013 as I see it \u2013 it was PERSON himself who had called into question the integrity of the police , in particular that of ORG , when the debate on police brutality resumed in DATE . In LAW of [ the book ] he states the following about the concept \u2018 misinformation\u2019 :", "\u2018 \u201c Misinformation \u201d can be defined in various ways . CARDINAL possible definition is untrue information , irrespective of whether the information is provided in good faith . It may , for example , be discovered subsequently that the research was mistaken on some point .", "There is little reason to place such a wide construction on the concept of misinformation . It is more practical to understand it as meaning deliberate or negligent dissemination of incorrect information . Misinformation in this sense is a problem that is easier to deal with than when our understanding is broadened only gradually .", "...", "If I were to base my conclusion on scattered information and impressions , it would be that the misinformation has been rather successful . The police , their organisations and supporters appear to have convinced fairly large parts of public opinion DATE which is hardly surprising . It is natural to call to mind how successful misinformation concerning the old GPE police force has been for DATE . In spite of the extremely bad conditions there \u2013 and the fact that sound documentation of these conditions was provided by at least some of the GPE newspapers from time to time , it was the misinformation that prevailed . The many members of the police that knew of the brutality did nothing to bring the circumstances to light.\u2019", "I can not read this in any other way than that PERSON here indeed himself accuses his opponents in the debate \u2013 \u2018 the police , its organisations and LAW \u2013 of lack of integrity , of knowingly hiding factual circumstances and of acting on the basis of inappropriate motives .", "It is in my view on this basis that the appellants\u2019 statements must be evaluated DATE and in particular those which were made after the publication of \u2018 Police Brutality\u2019 in DATE . The appellants\u2019 submission that they , who naturally must have felt offended on behalf of the police , were entitled to reply in the same manner is not as such ill - founded .", "In this connection it is in my view also of importance that the appellants expressed themselves on behalf of the police organisations in GPE and at the national level , respectively . They acted as elected representatives and spokesmen of the members . Very likely , and rightly so , they considered it an organisational duty to react to the attacks which were directed against the working methods of the police . It is not unusual in our society for the representatives of a profession to reply to public attacks in a way which might be lacking the necessary reflection and which might be somewhat inappropriate . The appellants were not familiar with the legislation on defamation either .", "PERSON has maintained that there must be a difference between what wellknown politicians must endure in respect of statements related to their political activities and the protection he enjoys when \u2018 from his professional standpoint he engages in important matters of public ORG . I do not agree ... and do not understand ... how this can be argued . In my opinion and as a matter of principle , when a scholar \u2013 for example in law \u2013 embarks on a public debate on matters of public interest he should not enjoy a greater right to protection under the defamation legislation than a politician .", "If I nevertheless agree with [ Mr Justice PERSON \u2019s ] conclusions , it is because I accept that there is a need to provide the best possible terms for a debate on \u2018 matters of public PERSON and that [ such a debate ] might suffer if statements such as those dealt with in this case are not declared null and void , even if their background is taken into consideration . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the reopening of CARDINAL of the \u201c boomerang cases \u201d . The requests to this effect which had been lodged in DATE had been rejected by ORG . ORG granted leave to appeal . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ORG found , in its final decision , that in the special circumstances at hand the correctness of the convictions was doubtful and that weighty considerations warranted a reassessment of the guilt of the convicted persons . In ORG view it was evident that police brutality had existed to a certain extent during DATE . The reason for the denial by police officers of any knowledge of such incidents had to be sought in \u201c misunderstood loyalty \u201d . It was highly probable that some police officers had given false evidence during the investigations of police brutality in GPE . On DATE the CARDINAL convicted persons were acquitted at the request of the prosecution which had found it unnecessary to bring new charges , failing a sufficient general interest .", "CARDINAL .
