The PERCENT threshold requirement could be lowered , in accordance with ORG ) and DATE ( DATE ) . The fact that the new ORG elected on DATE is far more representative than the outgoing ORG , representing PERCENT of the opinions of the electorate , is due to the fact that CARDINAL instead of CARDINAL parties are represented and to the ploy of opposition parties to launch party - sponsored independent candidates and not to any steps taken by the NORP authorities themselves .", "CARDINAL .

The threshold did not prevent independent candidates from standing . In the latest parliamentary elections , in DATE , voter turnout had been PERCENT , which showed how representative ORG was . Now that political stability had been restored the PERCENT threshold could be reconsidered . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Although there is no uniform classification of types of ballot and electoral systems , it is usual to distinguish CARDINAL main types : majority vote systems , proportional systems and mixed systems . In majority vote systems , the winner is the candidate or list of candidates obtaining the majority of the votes in the decisive round of voting . This type of ballot makes it possible to vote in governments with clear parliamentary majorities , but at the same time it militates against the representation of minority political parties . Thus , for example , in GPE the use over DATE of a single round of voting in a single - member majority vote system ( \u201c first past the post \u201d ) , combined with the existence of CARDINAL dominant political parties , has had the effect of giving few seats to other parties in relation to the number of votes that they obtain . There are other similar cases , in GPE for instance , where there is a majority vote system spread over CARDINAL rounds of voting . At the opposite extreme , the aim of the proportional representation system is to ensure that the votes cast are reflected in a proportional number of seats . Proportional representation is generally considered to be the fairest system because it tends to reflect more closely the various political forces . However , the disadvantage of proportional representation is that it tends to lead to fragmentation among those seeking electoral support and thus makes it more difficult to establish stable parliamentary majorities .", "CARDINAL . NORP Currently , proportional systems are the most widely used in LOC . By way of example , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE have opted for CARDINAL or other variant of proportional representation . There are also mixed systems containing various combinations of the CARDINAL types of ballot ( in GPE , GPE and GPE , for example ) .", "CARDINAL . In some proportional systems statutory thresholds are used to correct the negative effects of proportional voting , and in particular to ensure greater parliamentary stability . These thresholds , generally expressed as a percentage of the votes cast , are \u201c limits , fixed or variable , defined in terms of the electoral result , which determine the share of a list or candidate in the distribution of seats \u201d . However , the role played by thresholds varies in accordance with the level at which they are set and the party system in each country . A low threshold excludes only very small groupings , which makes it more difficult to form stable majorities , whereas in cases where the party system is highly fragmented a high threshold deprives many voters of representation .", "CARDINAL . Analysis of the electoral thresholds adopted in the member GPE which have proportional representation shows that CARDINAL States have opted for high thresholds : GPE has the highest , at PERCENT ; GPE has an PERCENT threshold ; and GPE and GPE a PERCENT one . CARDINAL of the States impose a PERCENT threshold and CARDINAL of them have chosen a lower figure . The other member GPE ( CARDINAL in number ) do not use thresholds . Moreover , in several systems the thresholds are applied only to a restricted number of seats ( in GPE and GPE , for example ) . Thresholds for parties and thresholds for coalitions may be set at different levels . In GPE , for example , the threshold for CARDINAL party is PERCENT , whereas in the case of a coalition it is raised by PERCENT for each of the constituent parties . In GPE , the threshold for coalitions is PERCENT whatever the number of constituent parties .
