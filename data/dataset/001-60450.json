The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who has a sociology degree , is a journalist and broadcaster . He has written for many national newspapers and magazines and has made a number of appearances on radio and television .", "In DATE an article was published in ORG magazine in which the applicant suggested that the athlete PERSON used banned performance - enhancing drugs . The article stated , inter alia :", "\u201c On the basis of circumstantial evidence many believe , but can not prove that ORG has been taking performance - enhancing drugs ... If he has been outwitting the testers for DATE , it is extremely unlikely that ORG will be caught in DATE left before his likely retirement from competitive sprinting . Nevertheless , there is no bloody hypodermic needle , and no direct evidence that points the finger at FAC ...", "Certainly DATE between injuring himself in GPE and winning in GPE would have allowed ORG to recover from a slight hamstring injury and , without fear of a random test , put in DATE intensive training , boosted by banned drugs , and perhaps human growth hormone , that would give him the explosiveness and power to run TIME into a headwind . We do n't know . ...", "ORG a number of other possible effects of these performance - enhancing drugs . His remarkable physique , in regard to both its bulk and definition , is consistent with the use of anabolic steroids . ... Similar considerations apply to speed ( sic ) with which he put on weight . In the early part of his career , he was a beanpole sprinter but DATE he put on QUANTITY in bodyweight to come in at the QUANTITY powerhouse that he has stayed at since . Steroids have other side - effects ... CARDINAL of the commonest are grandiosity , fixated delusions and a persecution complex . PERSON genuinely seems to think that running QUANTITY faster than anyone else is rather more than an exciting , even unique spectacle , but some kind of monumental contribution to human culture . ...", "Human growth hormone ... costs \u00a3 MONEY for a DATE 's supply . ORG is a steroid that is even more expensive ... Christie is rich . He also shows most of the physical , behavioural and psychological features of an athlete that regularly uses steroids . This conclusion is reinforced generally by the performances that he continues to turn in at an age when psychologically he should be in decline and specifically by his uncanny quick recovery from his injury at GPE . ...", "Aside from all the non - testing criteria that provide circumstantial evidence to suggest that ORG may be a regular user , the final clinching CARDINAL is ORG own character and attitude to competition . He is a win - at - all - cost athlete and his determination to succeed may lead people to believe that he would not deprive himself of an advantage enjoyed by some of his rivals , thereby denying himself his only chance of fame and fortune . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr Christie commenced an action in the High Court for defamation against the applicant , the magazine 's editor and the publishing company . The editor and publishing company were represented by a solicitor - advocate specialising in defamation and media litigation , Mr PERSON . Mr Price had advised the publishing company prior to publication about the legality of the article in question . A separate action was launched by Mr Christie against the printers and various distributors of the magazine .", "CARDINAL . During the greater part of the proceedings the applicant represented himself because he could not afford to pay legal fees and because , under Schedule CARDINAL , Part II , of LAW DATE , legal aid was not available for defamation actions . His defence was that the allegations made in the article were true in substance and in fact .", "In a newspaper article among the papers submitted by the applicant to the ORG , it was reported that the applicant had , in DATE , successfully defended himself in criminal proceedings concerning a charge of assaulting a neighbour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE there was a directions hearing at which Mr Price ( on behalf of the editor and publishing company ) , the applicant and counsel for PERSON made representations . An order was made requiring , inter alia , that the plaintiff and the defendants should exchange statements of witnesses of fact by DATE , and could each call CARDINAL expert witnesses ( a physiologist , a pharmacologist , a psychologist and an athletics coach ) , but only if the substance of each expert 's evidence was disclosed in a report to be exchanged by DATE . These time - limits were subsequently extended by consent to some time in DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . The applicant wished to rely on the evidence of an athlete , PERSON , who had allegedly told the applicant that Mr Christie had introduced him to performance - enhancing drugs . In respect of Mr Walusimbi the applicant served the following document dated DATE , which purported to be a statement of the nature of the evidence intended to be adduced under LAW ( RSC ) , LAW , Rule CARDINALA(CARDINAL ) ( see below ) :", "\u201c The second defendant has issued a subpoena on PERSON ... He intends to adduce evidence from him concerning :", "( a ) his masked appearance on the ORG [ television ] programme ' Drug Olympics ' ... in which he admitted taking performance - enhancing drugs ;", "( b ) his training relationship with PERSON ;", "( c ) his trips abroad with PERSON to various ORG , in particular one in GPE , ' ORG ;", "( d ) his knowledge of PERSON own use of performance - enhancing drugs . \u201d", "CARDINAL . One of the expert witnesses whom the applicant wished to call was an osteopath called PERSON . PERSON had been involved in sports medicine for over DATE and had treated PERSON . He allegedly told the applicant that as a result of his experience he was able to tell by the look and feel of an athlete 's body whether that athlete had taken performance - enhancing drugs , and that he was certain that Mr Christie had been a regular user . However , because of his previous association with PERSON Christie , PERSON did not wish to give a statement . The applicant did not , therefore , serve any form of report in respect of PERSON expert evidence as required by the order for directions . Instead , in DATE , he served the following document , which he mistakenly believed to be acceptable under the ORG , LAW , Rule CARDINALA(CARDINAL ) in place of an expert 's report :", "\u201c PERSON is a professional physiotherapist and went to the DATE Barcelona Olympic Games as team physiotherapist for the athletics squad . He is conversant with the effects of steroids on the body and talks about ' steroid feel ' and the particular look of a body that has been built up using anabolic - androgenic steroids . He is an expert on how the body responds to these drugs when supplemented by power lifting . He understands the effects of ageing on the performance of ' fast - twitch ' muscle . He has massaged the Plaintiff in the early part of his career .", "A subpoena has been taken out for PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The trial was listed to start on DATE . By this time , the applicant was the sole defendant in the proceedings because the editor had been killed in a traffic accident in DATE and the publishing company had become insolvent . On DATE the applicant instructed Mr Price , who had had no involvement in the case since the death of the editor , to represent him as his solicitor - advocate . Mr Price had previously given advice to the editor and the publishing company both prior to , and following , publication of the article and had drafted a defence to Mr ORG action on the limited information then available .", "CARDINAL . Mr Christie applied to prevent Mr Price from acting on the grounds that he had previously been responsible for the decision to publish the article concerned , having given legal advice to the editor , and that the legality of that decision was itself now at issue . As a result , PERSON argued that Mr Price had a conflict of interest . Mr ORG application was granted by the trial judge , Mr Justice PERSON , in ORG on DATE , but his decision was reversed by ORG DATE . The applicant was represented by PERSON at both hearings .", "CARDINAL . DATE before the trial Mr ORG solicitors indicated that they intended to make an application to the trial judge seeking to prevent the applicant from calling a number of witnesses , including PERSON and PERSON Walusimbi . Mr Price had , since being instructed by the applicant , made efforts to secure full statements from those witnesses . Following the indication received from Mr ORG solicitors , Mr PERSON agreed to make a signed statement , in which he described , inter alia , the effects of steroids and the high level of usage amongst athletes , and stated that \u201c it would be almost impossible to succeed at the highest levels in the QUANTITY [ event ] without the use of banned performance - enhancing drugs \u201d . This statement was served on Mr ORG solicitors at TIME on DATE , TIME before the trial was due to commence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE Mr Justice PERSON heard preliminary submissions from Mr Price on behalf of the applicant and counsel for PERSON Christie as to the admissibility of the evidence of the witnesses concerned . On DATE , in relation to the admissibility of the expert evidence of PERSON and a Professor PERSON on behalf of the applicant , he ruled as follows :", "\u201c The rules [ on disclosure of evidence ] are designed to avoid an ambush . ... They are not to beat inefficient litigants . There is provision for the Judge in exercise of his duty to give leave for evidence to be called . Mr Price at the forefront of his argument says the obligation was on the Plaintiff to ensure that the PERSON was not taken by surprise . That is a misunderstanding of the rules of the ORG . The rules provide that if the party wants to call an expert he should provide the substance of the expert 's report . Mr Price contends that PERSON expert statement leads to CARDINAL conclusion ; having observed the Plaintiff and massaged his body , everybody should understand what Mr PERSON was going to say . I think there is another way of reading the evidence . The Plaintiff might have concluded that it was useless evidence . This is compounded by the fact that PERSON statement deals with the ability to observe the effect of anabolic steroids but nowhere does he say that about the Plaintiff . The nearest he gets is at paragraph CARDINAL where he says that PERCENT of athletes use steroids systematically . That statement adds nothing to the defence as pleaded .", "There is no obligation on a party to draw the attention of the other party to the defect in its witness statements . At trial the admissibility of statements is often dealt with . There is criticism of the Plaintiff on this point but it is false . The obligation is on the party to make sure that it complies with Orders . It has not been suggested that the Defendant was unable to obtain written statements . The fact that he has statements suggests quite the contrary . The Defendant was a litigant in person but Mr Price acted for a period of time and Mr PERSON is not inexperienced . He has very much in mind what is involved . It may be said that Mr Price did not have full conduct but he has had since DATE . A review would have revealed that the statements did not comply with the Orders made . ... That I have discretion is clear . The exercise of that discretion is to ensure a fair disposal . ... \u201d", "The judge continued that he had to balance the prejudice that would be suffered by the applicant if the evidence were excluded against that which would be suffered by Mr Christie if PERSON testimony were admitted . It would be unfair to allow PERSON to give evidence at trial without giving Mr PERSON time to call counter - evidence , but to order an adjournment for this purpose would itself be prejudicial to Mr Christie because the applicant did not have sufficient means to provide an indemnity for the extra costs which would be incurred as a result . The judge concluded : \u201c If there is more prejudice to the Defendant than the Plaintiff he is the person who is responsible . The fault lies with him . I will not allow Mr PERSON 's evidence . \u201d He also refused the applicant leave to adduce that part of Professor PERSON 's evidence which dealt with the efficacy of drug testing and the ease with which the ban on drug taking could be evaded on the basis that these issues were not pleaded by the applicant and an amendment to the pleading should not be allowed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge refused to grant the applicant 's request for leave to admit PERSON evidence , on the ground that it would be unfair to PERSON to be faced with wide allegations about his drug taking , the details of which he would not know until PERSON took the stand .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against these rulings to ORG . He was again represented by PERSON at the appeal hearing , which took place on DATE . Lord Justice May , delivering the judgment of the court , commented , as had the trial judge , that the interests of the applicant were \u201c identical \u201d to those of his previous co - defendants , the editor and the publishing company . He went on :", "\u201c I deal with PERSON statement first . The gist statement served in DATE relating to PERSON contained very little detail of the substance of the evidence that he might give . It refers only to PERSON experience and qualifications as a physiotherapist and then says baldly that he massaged the plaintiff during the early part of his career . The witness statement now served gives a more detailed account of his experience and names some of the sportspeople , including the plaintiff , whom he has treated . It refers to the benefit and effect of anabolic steroids for athletes , particularly in the QUANTITY event . It states that in Mr PERSON 's experience a large proportion of professional athletes use steroids . It says that from his experience Mr PERSON is generally able to tell by looking whether an athlete is taking steroids and that he can also tell this if he manipulates their muscles . ...", "Mr Price accepts that the gist statement did not put forward any affirmative version of what PERSON might say , but he submits that it could be inferred that PERSON would give the evidence that the look and feel of the plaintiff 's body indicates use of banned drugs . I do not accept this submission . This gist statement is not even inferentially a statement of the evidence intended to be adduced such as is referred to in LAW , Rule CARDINALA(CARDINAL ) . ...", "Matters which Mr Price would have us infer are intended to be said by PERSON are neither pleaded nor the subject of any previously served witness statement or expert 's report and I see no reason why the plaintiff should have anticipated the sudden arrival of this material at the very last moment .", "Mr Price says that there is a strong public interest in allowing all relevant and probative evidence to be adduced lest there may be a verdict which is contrary to the truth . ... The judge took this important submission into account and so do I. The fact is that there are competing public interests , CARDINAL of which is that parties to litigation should not turn up at the very last moment with unheralded evidence which puts another party at a disadvantage , and another of which is that the general administration of justice demands , for reasons which have been articulated frequently by this court , that fixed trial dates should not be abandoned at the last moment other than in quite exceptional circumstances . ...", "It seems to me that the case for exercising the judge 's discretion in relation to Mr Moule as he did is clear and overwhelming . PERSON evidence was not heralded in the gist statement . The statement was served at the latest possible moment before the start of the trial . Without an adjournment of the trial ( which the judge rightly regarded as out of the question and which would in any event have prejudiced the plaintiff ) the plaintiff would be prejudiced by not being able properly to deal with the evidence . Any prejudice to the defendant was his own fault .", "The judge had to make a balancing judgment , which in my view he did upon proper and unassailable principles . Accordingly , I would not disturb the judge 's finding in relation to PERSON evidence . \u201d", "In relation to Mr Walusimbi 's evidence , he said :", "\u201c A gist statement was served in relation to Mr Walusimbi and referred to what he had said in a ORG programme . A transcript of the programme was provided on discovery . The [ applicant ] now wants to call Mr Walusimbi to say that the use of performance - enhancing drugs by athletes is widespread and that there are means of evading tests . Before the judge , he wanted to call Mr Walusimbi to give first - hand evidence that the plaintiff had taken drugs . This was neither pleaded nor included in the ORG material . The judge rightly excluded it and there is no application for leave to appeal against that part of the decision . The judge held that the general evidence added little or nothing to the issue of widespread drug taking . I agree , not least since I would permit Professor PERSON 's evidence to be adduced and this deals with the same topic . Further general evidence about widespread drug use by athletes does not go to establish that the plaintiff has taken drugs or that he is reasonably suspected of having done so . This again was very late evidence tendered in breach of court orders and the rules , and I consider that the judge exercised his discretion correctly to exclude it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The main trial commenced on DATE , DATE . The applicant represented himself as his funds were exhausted . On DATE the jury found , by a majority of CARDINAL , that the article complained of bore the meaning that", "\u201c Mr Christie is a cheat who regularly used banned performance - enhancing drugs to improve his success in athletic competition . \u201d", "It found also that the applicant had not proved that the article as so interpreted was substantially true .", "Although Mr Christie did not seek damages , the applicant was ordered to pay the costs of the action and was made subject to an injunction", "\u201c ... restraining the [ applicant ] whether by himself , his servants , agents or otherwise howsoever from further publishing or causing the publication of the allegation ( express or by implication ) that the plaintiff is a cheat who has regularly used performance - enhancing drugs to improve his success in athletic competition or any words to the same or similar effect ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
