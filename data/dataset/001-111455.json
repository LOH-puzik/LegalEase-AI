NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by PERSON , Attorney , ORG ) , as their Agent , assisted by PERSON , Attorney .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE without passport or other recognised travel document . When applying for asylum , he stated that he was of NORP ethnic origin and came from PERSON ( a town situated in GPE in north - western GPE ) , that he was not married and had no children . He feared being imprisoned and tortured by the NORP authorities if returned because he had been active in working for ORG in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that in DATE he had been recruited by CARDINAL GPE members . They had known that he had a cousin and a brother in GPE who worked for the party . The applicant formed part of a cell together with his cousin and a nephew . The cousin had been the leader of the group and had been the only person who had met their contact person on the NORP side . The members of the cell cooperated and had met DATE . They had selected a part of the PERSON town in GPE and had mapped out escape routes so that it would be safe to distribute leaflets . They had also tried to identify people who worked for the regime . The applicant had been active in distributing political materials and in recruiting new members .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant the GPE \u2019s office in GPE had invited him to travel to its main base there in order to discuss with other GPE activists . During his journey he had been recognised by a neighbour from GPE who had acted as a guard at his cousin \u2019s house when the applicant had spent TIME there . The neighbour had known that the applicant had come to meet with PERSON activists who were responsible for the party \u2019s activities in GPE .", "CARDINAL . After DATE the applicant had been told that the neighbour who had recognised him had given himself up to the authorities in GPE . The applicant stated that the neighbour no longer wished to be a guerrilla soldier . The applicant had then understood that the neighbour would inform the authorities about the applicant and therefore went into hiding for DATE . The applicant further explained that his brother had told him that the secret services had come to ask about him and had detained his brother for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then felt that his life was in danger . In DATE he had left GPE with the help of a smuggler , to ORG and from there to GPE . There he had applied for asylum through the ORG , but without success . A smuggler had also assisted him to travel illegally from GPE to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum application , finding it insufficiently probable that the applicant would be exposed to persecution for the purposes of LAW and national law .", "CARDINAL . The ORG did not find it likely that a guerrilla soldier linked to the party organisation in GPE would have reported to the NORP authorities because he wished to break away from that organisation . A person of such background would risk serious reactions from the NORP authorities . Therefore , the ORG did not find it sufficiently probable that the applicant would be in the authorities\u2019 limelight because of links to the GPE .", "CARDINAL . Making an assessment of the concrete circumstances as a whole , the ORG did not find that there were such weighty humanitarian considerations or that the applicant had strong links to GPE as could warrant a residence permit . Since he had relatives living in GPE , it could not be decisive that he had a brother living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by the same lawyer as before the ORG , appealed against the latter \u2019s rejection , arguing that it had erroneously based itself on the consideration that the neighbour had been a guerrilla soldier linked to the party organisation in GPE . The applicant pointed out that this person had been working for the NORP regime but had pretended that he was a guerrilla soldier so that he could spy on the activities of the PERSON and report on this to the NORP authorities . He had withdrawn from the PERSON in GPE when he feared that the party would discover his spying activities . This had not clearly come to light in the asylum interview and ORG had based its decision on wrong facts . The neighbour would not have risked serious reactions from the authorities but feared the reactions of the PERSON if he were to be revealed , which had been the reason why he had withdrawn as a guerrilla soldier . The applicant had received this information in GPE where he had been in contact with the PERSON . His brother , PERSON , had also told the applicant about the matter . Accordingly , the person in question had possessed all the information about the applicant and had reported to the NORP authorities . They had come to his home an had asked for him and his brother , PERSON , had been arrested while the applicant was absent . This showed that the authorities had been aware of the applicant \u2019s activities . He was convinced that he would be arrested and executed should he be returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant further submitted that his brother , PERSON , had also been linked to the GPE in GPE and had been granted political asylum in GPE . This fact would worsen the applicant \u2019s situation if returned to GPE . NORP authorities would also associate him with further activities in GPE . The Directorate had in its decision acknowledged that links to the GPE would lead to serious reactions form the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused to alter its decision , finding no new information that could warrant this .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( NOAS ) supported the applicant \u2019s contention that the ORG had based itself on an error of fact when considering that it was not probable that a guerrilla soldier linked to the party organisation in GPE would report to the NORP authorities because he wished to break away from that organisation . ORG further pointed to the fact that the applicant still was a PERSON member and that during the visit of its Secretary General , PERSON , in GPE in DATE the applicant had taken part in a PERSON meeting and had been photographed together with him .", "CARDINAL . NOAS in addition referred to a report of the Schweizerische Fl\u00fcchtlingshilfe according to which NORP citizens who left the country illegally or did not follow the rules on exit risked DATE and DATE imprisonment and/or a fine upon return , and would face ransacking and questioning about the reasons for their sojourn abroad as well as electronic verification of whether they had breached NORP laws or criminal law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal , stating inter alia :", "\u201c The ORG observes that the [ applicant ] \u2019s account of how he attracted the attention of the authorities owing to GPE activities has not been made sufficiently probable to be relied upon . In the asylum interview , the [ applicant ] informed that his work for the party was discovered by a neighbour from GPE who worked as a guerrilla soldier for the GPE , but who later gave himself up to the authorities . ORG concurs in the ORG \u2019s assessment , and finds this very improbable .", "It was further argued in the appeal that the ORG had based its decision on an incorrect premise . It was made clear that the [ applicant ] \u2019s neighbour from GPE did not work for the GPE , as the ORG had assumed , but as a spy for the NORP authorities . According to information the [ applicant ] was said to have received from GPE members , his neighbour had as time went on become afraid of being revealed as a spy for the authorities , and had therefore pulled out . The [ applicant ] has also submitted that the NORP regime carries out considerable intelligence activities by infiltrating agents into oppositional political parties .", "The ORG observes that , in the asylum interview , the [ applicant ] had been asked several specific questions on precisely this topic , and that he had given a detailed account of the events . The [ applicant ] had moreover read and signed the transcript of his answers . The [ applicant ] had also been informed that this was probably the only interview that would be held . In the view of the ORG , it therefore seems remarkable and implausible that the [ applicant ] should present a new explanation of this matter in the appeal . ORG has therefore very little faith in the [ applicant ] \u2019s testimony on this point .", "...", "ORG has noted the declarations of DATE from ORG , the letters of support of DATE from ORG in GPE and of DATE from the GPE Association , the confirmation of DATE from ORG of Norway and the membership confirmation of DATE from the GPE in GPE , but does not find that it is able to attach decisive importance to these documents . Reference is made to the very general nature of the declarations , and that they do not associate the [ applicant ] with concrete episodes entailing a well - founded fear of persecution .", "ORG has further noted the submissions from ORG , but does not find that it can attach decisive importance to these either . ORG observes that reference is made to reports of a general nature that do not associate the [ applicant ] with concrete episodes entailing a well - founded fear of persecution .", "The ORG therefore does not find sufficient evidence that the [ applicant ] had aroused the attention of the authorities of his country of origin to such an extent that he foreseeably risked persecution prior to his departure .", "The ORG finds otherwise reason to doubt that the [ applicant ] has been active as a member of the party in his country of origin by distributing flyers , etc . Besides referring to the above points , which , in the view of the ORG , weaken his general credibility , it is observed that the party , according to the information available to ORG , no longer espouses the goal of an independent GPE in its party program nor does it take part in armed conflict . However , the [ applicant ] has asserted the opposite in his self - declaration and in a supplementary letter . Nor is there any evidence that the party has been conspicuous in distributing flyers with oppositional content in NORP areas of GPE in DATE . Nor in the ORG \u2019s view do the [ applicant ] \u2019s answers and the information in his self - declaration and asylum interview support his statements concerning his activities prior to his departure . His account of his activities appears partly superficial and of little evidential value in itself , cf . otherwise the above . However , this is not decisive , since it can not regardless be assumed that his alleged activities are known to the NORP authorities or that it is otherwise foreseeable that the authorities will persecute him .", "ORG has taken into consideration that the [ applicant ] has participated in various political events in GPE , and has noted the various websites where this is said to have been documented , and where pictures of the [ applicant ] in the company of members of the GPE have been published . After assessing these websites , ORG does not consider that this will entail any foreseeable danger of persecution on his return . As far as ORG is aware , the NORP authorities show relatively little interest in the political activities of NORP in exile , and do not view these as constituting any real threat to the regime . The [ applicant ] can not on the basis of the above - mentioned activities be said to appear to be a particularly important dissident or to be particularly at risk of serious reactions as a consequence of these activities .", "The ORG therefore does not find sufficient evidence that the [ applicant ] will be of particular interest to the authorities as a consequence of his political involvement while in GPE .", "As regards the PERSON background of his brother and other family members , ORG observes that , as far as ORG is aware , the NORP authorities do not engage in derivative persecution of family members or other relatives of politically active persons .", "Making an overall assessment , ORG therefore finds that it has not been shown to be sufficiently probable that the [ applicant ] would risk persecution on return to his country of origin , and he is not to be deemed a refugee within the meaning of LAW and LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Nor did the ORG find , even on a reduced standard of proof , any risk of the applicant loosing his life or being subjected to ill - treatment should he be returned .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG did not find that granting the applicant a residence permit was warranted by strong humanitarian considerations . He was an adult man without serious health problems who had strong links to his home country and who did not have any particular links to GPE , although he had a brother and a cousin living there .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently made a number of requests for reconsideration of the ORG \u2019s rejection of CARDINAL DATE , but to no avail . After CARDINAL rejections , dated DATE and DATE , respectively , the applicant , represented by a new lawyer , presented several new factual arguments to the ORG requesting it to reconsider the matter . Together with his brother , he had cooperated with the resistance movement in GPE . Whilst the brother had obtained asylum in GPE the applicant \u2019s asylum request had been refused . They had arrived in GPE DATE apart from each other in DATE . In GPE they had assumed that the authorities would return them to GPE . They had therefore decided that CARDINAL of them should inform that they had been in GPE working for the resistance movement , so that CARDINAL of them should have the chance to get out of GPE without being returned . As to why they had adopted such a strategy , the applicant stated that he would forward documentation that proved that he had been in GPE working for the resistance . He also alleged that while in GPE , he had made political songs against the NORP regime that had been disseminated in GPE . He believed that he was known in GPE also for this reason .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the request . It considered that the new information in part expanded on the basis for his asylum claim , in part conflicted with his earlier explanation . Neither in the asylum interview , nor in his appeal , had the applicant stated that he had worked for the PERSON in GPE . On the contrary , he had affirmed that his activities had been limited to his hometown PERSON . Also the information that he and his brother had assumed that the NORP authorities would return them to GPE was new and inconsistent with what the applicant had stated during the asylum interview . ORG did not find the applicant \u2019s new information credible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed another revision request in which the applicant had relied on a statement from the PERSON in the GPE Governorate in GPE regarding his activities for the party .", "CARDINAL . On DATE it refused a further request invoking the general security situation in GPE after the elections and that he had married ( on DATE ) a NORP citizen , PERSON , in accordance with NORP tradition .", "CARDINAL . The ORG rejected yet a further petition , on DATE . The applicant had invoked that he had left GPE DATE , he had stayed in GPE for DATE , he had worked lawfully and paid taxes in GPE , his wife and brother were NORP citizens and his wife was pregnant . As to the latter , the ORG drew attention to the possibility to apply for family reunification .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that the applicant should be expelled from GPE indefinitely ( sections CARDINAL ( a ) and PERSON ) of LAW DATE ) on the ground of his aggravated breaches of NORP immigration laws : He had avoided the implementation of decisions that implied a duty for him to leave the country , had resided illegally in GPE for DATE , and had worked illegally in GPE after the revocation of his work permit on DATE . The ORG observed that this was not a disproportionate measure . He had had no legitimate expectation of being able to stay in GPE when he married PERSON on DATE and no or little weight could be attached to the fact that he had a brother living in GPE . The ORG considered that this decision was consistent with LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a further decision of DATE , the ORG limited the duration of the prohibition on re - entry to DATE . In this connection it reiterated that no document had been submitted to the effect that the couple had concluded a valid marriage ( under NORP law ) . Neither their marriage nor their parenthood had been registered in the population register .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the ORG decided , in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG , to indicate to ORG , under LAW , that the applicant should not be expelled to GPE until further notice .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of CARDINAL DATE No . CARDINAL ( tvisteloven ) , a decision by ORG could form the subject of an appeal to the competent city court or district court ( tingrett ) ( ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , from there to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) ( ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and ultimately to ORG ( Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . The domestic courts had full jurisdiction to review the lawfulness of the ORG \u2019s decision and were empowered to quash the decision should they find that it was unlawful . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , the provisions of the LAW were to be applied in accordance with GPE \u2019s international legal obligations intended to strengthen the legal position of a foreign national . In the event of conflict between the national legal provision and GPE \u2019s obligations under the Convention , the latter was to take precedence ( sections QUANTITY and CARDINAL of LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under Chapters CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , a person whose expulsion had been ordered by the immigration authorities could apply to the courts for an interlocutory injunction to stay the implementation of the expulsion order .", "CARDINAL . Further conditions regarding judicial review of ORG decision were set out inter alia in the following provisions and guidelines .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , the fee for filing a lawsuit before a city court or a district court was CARDINAL NORP Krone ( ORG ) , corresponding to MONEY ( ORG ) , if the hearing lasted for DATE and ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) if the hearing lasted for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL ( rettsgebyrloven ) , fees should be paid in advance . In the event that a sufficient amount had not been paid when a request for a judicial order had been made , the court was to fix a brief time - limit for payment . Should that payment not be effected within the time - limit fixed , the court shall dismiss the case , unless the provisions in section CARDINAL apply . The latter provided :", "\u201c If a party has applied for free legal aid or for exemption from the payment of court fees under LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL [ rettshjelploven ] , a respite should be granted until the application has been decided . In this event no security can be required for the payment of the fee .", "If a party who has requested a procedural step [ rettergangsskritt ] has obtained respite in accordance with the foregoing , the court shall grant the measure . In other cases the court may grant a measure if the party who has requested it is unable to pay immediately and it would entail a damage or significant inconvenience for that party if the measure is not taken .
