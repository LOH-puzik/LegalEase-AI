The applicant alleges that cash , in the amount of LTL CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL ) , and a packet of washing powder were removed . The prison administration considered that the possession of these items was prohibited by FAC and ORG .", "On DATE the prison administration , having obtained a prosecutor \u2019s approval , ordered that the confiscated money be transferred to the ORG \u2019s account .", "On DATE a special disciplinary commission of the prison decided to impose on the applicant a disciplinary penalty , namely the deprivation of the right to receive or send a parcel on CARDINAL occasion , and to purchase food in the prison shop for DATE .", "The applicant brought a court action , contesting the search and the penalty . In particular , he complained that the above decisions had been taken in his absence , in breach of his defence rights . The applicant also alleged that he had suffered double jeopardy by way of the confiscation of his money as well as the imposition of the disciplinary penalty on DATE . He requested that the money be returned to him .", "In the context of the action , the applicant was granted free legal assistance for his representation before a court .", "On DATE ORG examined the case in the presence of the applicant . The lawyer assigned to represent him failed to appear . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s request to adjourn the examination of the case , having found that the applicant \u2019s lawyer had been duly informed of the hearing .", "The applicant \u2019s action was dismissed . The court first held that the applicant \u2019s money had been confiscated and transferred to the ORG \u2019s account in accordance with LAW . That measure was not deemed a \u201c penalty \u201d under domestic law since it was not included in the exhaustive list of disciplinary penalties ( LAW ) . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s allegation that he had been punished twice . It was furthermore established that , prior to the search , the prison inspectors had proposed that the applicant voluntarily show them any possibly illicit items . Had the applicant shown the cash , it would not have been confiscated but returned to him , in accordance with LAW . However , the applicant had failed to do so . The court also noted that the law ( providing for the confiscation of any cash held in the prison ) was justified in the public interest .", "It was also established that the penalty of DATE was imposed in accordance with LAW for a breach of prison discipline .", "The court noted , however , that the disciplinary proceedings had been conducted in breach of LAW , which guaranteed to the accused the right to be heard by a special disciplinary commission of the prison before the decision on a disciplinary penalty was taken . Nevertheless , the court considered that that irregularity had not rendered the proceedings as a whole unfair , since the applicant had been afforded the opportunity to submit his explanations to the commission in writing , in accordance with LAW . There was no evidence that the applicant had intended to present any new arguments in addition to those indicated in his written explanations , as he had not submitted any new statements to the court .", "The applicant appealed , complaining that the case had been examined in the absence of his lawyer . He was again granted free legal aid for his representation before the appellate court .", "On DATE ORG examined the case in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer , dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeal .

The applicant claimed non - pecuniary damages in the amount of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( about ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE ORG essentially accepted the applicant \u2019s claim , the applicant being present . The court held inter alia :", "\u201c It is undisputed that the official hygienic norms ( ORG ) guarantee the minimum space of QUANTITY for each inmate . The conditions in the [ Sniego Prison ] are not in compliance with the above norm , since the number of inmates exceeds that fixed by the order of DATE by the Director of ORG of ORG . While the order establishes CARDINAL places in the [ prison ] , as a matter of fact CARDINAL inmates are held there at any CARDINAL time . ...", "[ T]he Civil Code foresees CARDINAL conditions for civil liability : [ a ] the unlawful actions or inaction of the respondent [ ORG institution ] or its employees , [ b ] damage , and [ c ] the causal link between the actions ( inaction ) and the damage . It is for the applicant who seeks civil damages to demonstrate the existence of all these elements . \u201d", "The ORG concluded that the applicant had not shown that he had suffered non - pecuniary damage as a result of the slight overcrowding .", "The applicant appealed , stating that the prison administration had not submitted any evidence to show that it had requested additional finances from ORG or the Government . The applicant also pointed out that the lack of space in the Sniego Prison had been acknowledged as a fact .", "On DATE ORG examined the case in the applicant \u2019s presence , dismissing the appeal and upholding the reasoning of the lower court .", "From the medical reports submitted by the applicant , it appears that from DATE to CARDINAL DATE the applicant had consulted the prison doctor CARDINAL times . On several occasions he was diagnosed with a number of minor illnesses . The medical report of DATE indicated that the applicant should be relieved from work and allowed to stay in bed , without specifying any reasons . Several medical reports dating DATE also indicated that the applicant had sought consultations due to headaches , hypertension and certain psychological disorders .", "On DATE and DATE , ORG upheld the decisions of ORG to refuse the request of the prison administration for the applicant \u2019s release on licence .", "On DATE the FAC granted the request of the prison administration , ordering the applicant \u2019s conditional release .", "The applicant was released on DATE .", "LAW prohibits inhuman and degrading treatment .", "The Prisons Code ( as then in force ) provided :", "LAW :", "\u201c Punishment is not intended to cause physical suffering or degrade human dignity . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL", "\u201c Searches of inmates shall be carried out . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL", "\u201c Convicts are not permitted to keep money in cash ...
