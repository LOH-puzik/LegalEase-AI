The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They are father and son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants and friends of theirs were holidaying beside a lake near GPE . In turns , members of the group were riding a jetboat . On several occasions some of them rode close to a sports centre on the opposite shore .", "CARDINAL . NORP Some time later , unexpectedly , CARDINAL cars without licence plates arrived at the lakeside location where the applicants ' group was situated . CARDINAL men wearing camouflage uniforms got out of the cars , some of them wore vests with \u201c Police \u201d written on the back . The men were armed with sub - machine guns . They started insulting the applicants and their friends and threatening them , both verbally and by pointing their guns at them . The men made the applicants and their friends lie flat on the ground and then hit and kicked them repeatedly . The beating continued for TIME . At the same time , the men repeatedly shot at the applicants ' jetboat . After that they left .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was examined by doctors who established that he had CARDINAL broken ribs , a superficial wound on his left temple and several bruises on his face , back and legs . The second applicant suffered bruises on his face , head and right leg .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants complained to the prosecution authorities . On CARDINAL and DATE the first applicant lodged additional submissions , stating that he and his son were being followed and that he had been threatened in an attempt to induce him to withdraw his complaints .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution authorities opened criminal proceedings in relation to the beating and , on unspecified dates , brought charges against QUANTITY police officers working in ORG , a specialised unit of ORG . It was established that , at the relevant time , the accused had been dispatched to the area where the beating had taken place , with the task of guarding a Ministry of the Interior training centre and a forest reserve .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution authorities collected witness testimonies from the applicants and their friends , as well as from other witnesses , including eyewitnesses to the beating .

On an unspecified date the applicants were admitted as civil claimants in the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

NORP In DATE or DATE the prosecution indicted the QUANTITY police officers for causing bodily harm and for disorderly conduct .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG remitted the case , finding that the prosecution authorities had committed procedural violations . In particular , it found that : CARDINAL ) it was not clear from the indictment whether the accused had been armed with sub - machine or automatic guns during the attack against the applicants ; CARDINAL ) the indictment had been based on insufficient evidence , and , in particular , on no material evidence ; CARDINAL ) CARDINAL of the witnesses had been examined superficially ; and CARDINAL ) the prosecution had failed to comment on exonerating witness testimony .", "CARDINAL .

In such instances , the courts would send the case to the relevant public prosecutor 's office with instructions to either enter an indictment against the accused within DATE or discontinue the criminal proceedings . If the prosecutor 's office failed to take action , or if the case was remitted for material procedural breaches , which were not remedied within a new time - limit of DATE , the courts would terminate the criminal proceedings themselves .
