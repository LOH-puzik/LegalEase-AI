SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals , who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in V\u00e4stervik . They were represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants have a daughter , PERSON In DATE she gave birth to a son , PERSON , of whom she has sole custody . However , for most of his life , PERSON has been living with the applicants . In DATE PERSON gave birth to a second son who was placed in public care in DATE .", "In DATE PERSON picked up PERSON at the school he attended in V\u00e4stervik and brought him to PERSON , where she had taken up residence . The applicants reported this event to ORG ( socialn\u00e4mnden ) in PERSON and requested it to take action in order to have PERSON returned to them . The ORG started an investigation of the matter . In DATE and DATE several psychologists and social welfare officers submitted opinions which did not question the applicants\u2019 ability to assume the care and custody of PERSON but rather tended towards finding that PERSON would be better off living with the applicants .", "On DATE the ORG decided to take no action . The social welfare officers in charge of the matter considered that PERSON should live with his mother , his legal custodian . According to an opinion issued by ORG ( barn- och ungdomspsykiatriska kliniken ) in GPE on DATE , it was of utmost importance that PERSON was given a permanent home and that this should be with his mother .", "In DATE the applicants took PERSON from PERSON in GPE and went into hiding . In an application to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , PERSON requested that PERSON be returned to her .", "On DATE the chairman of ORG in PERSON decided to take PERSON into compulsory public care immediately due to the applicants\u2019 illegal abduction of him . This decision was not enforced , however , as the applicants were still in hiding .", "On DATE ORG held an oral hearing in the case . PERSON attended , assisted by public counsel . Also officers of ORG were heard . The applicants were not present or represented . PERSON stated , inter alia , that the applicants had removed PERSON from his home without her permission and had refused to return him . She also claimed that the applicants had physically assaulted him and exerted pressure on him . The social welfare officers stated that PERSON suffered from the conflict between his mother and his grandparents and that it was not possible to discuss with the applicants the possibility of returning PERSON to his mother . They also considered that PERSON needed psychiatric treatment in accordance with a plan which had been drawn up by ORG and to which PERSON had consented . Further , due to PERSON \u2019s state of health and the risk that he be removed to GPE , it was allegedly urgent that he be returned to his mother .", "On DATE the ORG decided that PERSON be taken care of immediately in accordance with LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) and ordered the police authorities in PERSON to enforce the decision . It left it to ORG to decide on the proper measures with regard to the care . In its reasoning , the ORG found that the matter was urgent due to PERSON \u2019s health and as there was a risk that PERSON could be removed out of the country . On DATE the ORG quashed the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE to take PERSON into compulsory public care .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , stating that it would be detrimental to PERSON to be separated from his grandparents . The Court held an oral hearing , where the applicants , though absent themselves , were represented by court - appointed counsel .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the appellate court rejected the ORG appeal . It generally agreed with the reasoning of ORG and added that it had not been possible to enforce that court \u2019s decision since the applicants were still in hiding with PERSON The applicants lodged an appeal , but it was dismissed by the appellate court on DATE for having been lodged out of time . On DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) rejected an application for restoration of the expired time .", "On DATE the applicants and PERSON were apprehended in GPE and PERSON was returned to his mother in GPE . ORG decided to prohibit all access between the applicants and PERSON", "On DATE ORG refused the ORG request to be informed of PERSON \u2019s telephone number , referring to the confidentiality applicable to such information under LAW ( LAW ; CARDINAL ) . The applicants did not appeal against the decision .", "On DATE the applicants requested access to PERSON and also wished to be informed of the results of possible psychiatric examinations of him .", "By a letter of CARDINAL DATE a social welfare officer informed the applicants that PERSON opposed access and that ORG did not consider it to be in the best interests of PERSON to allow meetings with the applicants at that time , as such contact would have disturbed the developing relationship between PERSON and his mother . This opinion was supported by a psychologist at ORG in GPE , who had been consulted in the matter . The applicants were also told that information on psychiatric examinations was confidential and , thus , could only be disclosed to the custodian .", "On DATE ORG decided not to initiate court proceedings with a view to establishing access between the applicants and PERSON and to reject the request for information . The applicants did not appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision .", "On DATE ORG decided , at the request of PERSON , to strike out the case relating to PERSON \u2019s request in DATE for the return of PERSON to her , noting that PERSON had already been returned to her . The ORG observed that the ORG counsel had not commented on the strike - out request , although he had been notified thereof .", "The first applicant appealed against the strike - out decision and also requested that he and his wife be awarded custody of PERSON On DATE ORG dismissed his action , finding that he lacked standing to appeal against the decision in question and that the ORG did not have jurisdiction to decide on transfer of custody . On DATE ORG refused the first applicant leave to appeal . On DATE the same court rejected his application for a reopening of the proceedings .", "According to the applicants , PERSON has repeatedly been told by social welfare officers that no access , correspondence or telephone contacts between PERSON and the applicants would be allowed until PERSON reached the age of majority ( i.e. until DATE ) .", "NORP law does not afford grandparents any rights over their grandchildren . The rights over a child are normally vested in its parents or custodians who , according to chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , shall see to it that the child \u2019s need of access to a person who is particularly close to the child is satisfied to the utmost possible extent . As concerns the possibility of instituting court proceedings , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides that such proceedings may be brought by ORG , if access requested by somebody else than the natural parents is denied by the child \u2019s custodians . The court shall determine the question of access in keeping with the child \u2019s best interests . Also , under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , the court shall have regard to the risk of the child being abused , being illegally removed or detained , or otherwise suffering harm when contacts take place with the person requesting access .", "According to the preparatory documents to the above legislation ( see Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL and DATE ) , it has not been deemed appropriate that any person who claims to have a particularly close relationship to a child should be entitled to bring an action for access before the courts . Therefore , contrary to what is the case with the child \u2019s parents , ORG has the exclusive right to bring such an action . The ORG makes use of this right only in rare cases . In practice , when the social authorities are informed , for instance by the person concerned , that the child \u2019s custodian fails to ensure that the child can meet with a person to which it has a close relation , the ORG shall investigate whether such a contact can be considered as being in the best interests of the child and , if that is the case , take action with a view to establishing access , ultimately by requesting a court decision .", "Similar rules apply to the question of custody . Thus , under LAW , LAW CARDINAL of LAW , the custody of a child may be transferred to a person who has constantly cared for the child , if this is deemed to be in the child \u2019s best interests . The transfer of custody is decided by ORG upon application by ORG .", "There does not appear to be any NORP case - law on the question whether the person requesting access or custody has standing to appeal against a decision by ORG not to institute court proceedings in the matter .", "When the child is in the home of another person , chapter DATE , section CARDINAL of the Parental Code gives the custodian an opportunity to apply to ORG for a decision that steps be taken to transfer the child to him or her . If there is a risk of the child being removed out of the country or if the matter is urgent for some other reason , the court may , LAW , section CARDINAL , order that the child be taken care of immediately in the manner it considers appropriate ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
