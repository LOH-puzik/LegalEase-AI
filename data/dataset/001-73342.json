On DATE the applicant did not appear at work at ORG , a public utility company , despite the instruction of his superior according to which no employee was allowed to take DATE off for DATE due to the heavy workload . The applicant justified his absence with the fact that he had celebrated a NORP religious holiday which was a public holiday for the citizens of NORP faith under the LAW and the respective law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the disciplinary committee of the company found that the applicant had breached the disciplinary rules and been absent from work without authorisation . The committee decided not to dismiss the applicant but fined him with a PERCENT cut in his salary for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to the second instance committee , arguing that there had been a decision of ORG to the effect that CARDINAL DATE had been a public holiday for citizens of NORP faith . As a member of this religious community , he had informed his superior about his absence DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second instance committee upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE , on the ground that the applicant had breached the instruction of CARDINAL DATE by which no employee was allowed to take DATE off because of the heavy workload .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG , claiming that his rights set out in Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW had been breached . In particular , he had been fined only because he had celebrated the NORP religious holiday and had not come to work on DATE , in accordance with the decision of ORG according to which CARDINAL DATE was a public holiday for the citizens of NORP faith .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing before ORG the applicant stated that he expressed his religious beliefs individually without going to mosques .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on the ground that he did not adduce any evidence to prove that he was really of NORP faith .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s further appeal . It stated that it was true that religious beliefs were an inner matter for the individual person . However , in the instant case it was to be established whether the applicant \u2019s absence from work was justified . Therefore , it was important to establish the applicant \u2019s religious confession . The lower court was correct in dismissing the applicant \u2019s complaint as the applicant had not proven that he had been a NORP since he had also celebrated the NORP religious holidays .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was again fined for not having appeared at work on DATE at the time of the celebration of another NORP religious holiday , GPE . The fine corresponded to PERCENT of his DATE salary over DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s complaint was dismissed by the second instance committee .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained to ORG that ORG had deprived him of his right to an additional paid DATE for NORP citizens although he had stated before the second instance committee that he was NORP . However , he had not considered it necessary to change his name and surname accordingly and wished to worship on his own .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court stated that under the relevant law persons of NORP faith enjoyed the right to paid religious holidays . However , the applicant had not given any evidence to corroborate his statement that he was a NORP . He had never been absent from work at the time of the NORP religious holidays before DATE . On the contrary , he had celebrated the NORP religious holidays , his parents were NORP and his way of life and diet showed that he was of NORP faith . From his employment contract and insurance it transpired that he had been registered as NORP without any mention of being a NORP . The court held that the applicant was a self - proclaimed NORP in order to justify his unjustified absence from work .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on the ground that while it was true that the religious beliefs were an inner matter , he had breached the disciplinary rules and had not come to work . He therefore had to justify his absence and it had been necessary to establish through evidence whether the applicant was truly of NORP faith . There was however no evidence to this effect , as the applicant , an ethnic NORP , had been absent from work during the NORP religious holidays and had celebrated them . Therefore , his absence from work was unjustified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that through disciplinary sanctions and judicial decisions he had been discriminated against because of his religious beliefs . In particular , for unknown reasons the courts had not considered his statement that he was of NORP faith to be credible and had asked him for further proof . He claimed that he should not be required to produce evidence of his religious beliefs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to examine the applicant \u2019s allegations in respect of the decisions of DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE of the public utility company , the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE of ORG and the decision of DATE of ORG for being lodged out of the DATE time limit provided for in the Rules of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court however examined the applicant \u2019s complaint in regard of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . It noted that the applicant requested the exercise of rights relating to freedom of religion but that he did not produce any evidence concerning his beliefs and refused to do so . As concerned the initial question as to whether when exercising a right to a paid public holiday based on religion it was enough for a citizen subjectively to assert his faith , it held :", "\u201c Taking into consideration that the rule of law is fundamental to the constitutional order of GPE under Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , under which it should be implied that objective legal norms take precedence over subjective will when requesting the exercise of legal rights , and given the viewpoint of the representatives of the NORP and NORP religions ... ( the dean at ORG in GPE and the head of the NORP community in GPE ) that there are objective criteria to determine whether a citizen holds NORP and NORP religious beliefs ... the court held that it was necessary to establish objective facts related to the exercise of a right and to obtain evidence of them in a situation where a right is requested .", "In line with this , with a view to establishing objective facts to assess whether there was discrimination on religious grounds in this case , the court held a public hearing ( on DATE ) and CARDINAL consultative discussions ( on CARDINAL and DATE May and DATE ) and on the basis of their contents , in particular , on the basis of the applicant \u2019s statements , it was established that the contents of his religious belief ( even their form ) objectively did not correspond to those of the NORP faith ( and its form ) on several grounds ( for example : a lack of knowledge of the basic most important tenets of the religion through which its essence is expressed ... or of the way in which one \u2018 ORG the NORP faith , etc . ) \u201d", "CARDINAL .
