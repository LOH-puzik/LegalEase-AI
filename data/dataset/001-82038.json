The open letter was signed by the applicants and CARDINAL editors - in - chief .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG birzhevaya gazeta newspaper published the open letter on its front page . The relevant extracts of the letter , translated from NORP , read as follows :", "\u201c We ( authors of the open letter ) subscribe to various political views but are unanimous in our support of the President 's drive to curb corruption in the country , bring order to the economy , and assert the rule of law and democratic standards in all sectors of society . We have gathered at the round table because of our common concern for the fate of the President 's reforms in GPE . GPE is gradually transforming into a private holding controlled by Governor PERSON and his close circle ... [ emphasis added , see below ]", "DATE we ( the independent media ) embarrass the regional authorities because we openly disagree with the selfish and destructive policy of the governor and his team , we publish materials denouncing bribe - takers and officials who abuse their position ...", "Once again , as in DATE when the [ NORP ] ORG 's nomenclature feared their imminent dismissal , the regional authorities have started reprisals against the independent media . Journalists are subjected to threats and beatings , our publications are prohibited from being printed and distributed in the region ...", "On the other side \u2013 the independent media , whose attempts to stand for the rule of law , human rights , to talk about bringing order to the economy and to expose corruption are routinely suppressed by the governor and his acolytes ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The remainder of the open letter harshly criticised the Governor of GPE personally and contained allegations of serious wrongdoings .", "CARDINAL .

They named the applicants and other signatories to the letter , as well as the newspaper that published it , as co - defendants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the original plaintiffs were joined by CARDINAL other members of ORG with identical claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL of the original plaintiffs , Mr NORP , withdrew his claim . Speaking to the GPE birzhevaya gazeta newspaper , he described the proceedings as \u201c an attempt to bring the media under control \u201d .

On CARDINAL DATE ORG gave judgment . It carried out at the outset a detailed analysis of federal and regional laws on the structure of ORG and reached the following conclusion on the plaintiffs ' standing in the defamation suit :", "\u201c ... any ORG official in ORG wields a certain power and authority that is essential to the performance of his functional duties ; hence , he falls into the category of ' regional authority ' . Considering that the ' regional authority ' is made up of individuals , that is , ORG officials , the term ' regional authority ' applies to each plaintiff who is , by virtue of his position , a ORG official in GPE .", "The words ' the close circle of ORG , ' the governor 's acolytes ' , and ' the governor 's team ' used in the impugned publication are DATE in the court 's opinion , and despite the defendants ' and their representatives ' assertions to the contrary \u2013 applicable to all ORG officials [ working in ] the executive body of ORG and , therefore , to the plaintiffs . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG then examined the truthfulness of the applicants ' statements referring to the \u201c destructive \u201d policy of the governor 's team . It found that the applicants had not used any \u201c scientific methodology for a comprehensive assessment of the social and economic development of the region \u201d for the preparation of the open letter and that their evaluation had been entirely based on their personal views . The court rejected the statement by Mr NORP on the economic decline in GPE in DATE because he had been dismissed from the ORG and therefore , in the court 's opinion , he was on the defendants ' side . The court concluded that the statements referring to the \u201c selfish and destructive policy \u201d were untrue .", "CARDINAL . Likewise , ORG found no evidence to support the statements referring to the persecution of journalists in GPE . It pointed out that one of the signatories , the editor - in - chief of a local newspaper , could not prove that an attack on CARDINAL of his journalists had been politically motivated . In the court 's opinion , the fact that certain members of the Government had put pressure on local officials to subscribe to the newspapers controlled by the governor to the detriment of all others was lawful and could not be interpreted as \u201c prohibition on distribution \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the extracts of the open letter bold - faced in the text above were not true and damaged the honour and dignity of the plaintiffs as the members of ORG . It ordered that all the plaintiffs be jointly compensated for non - pecuniary damage : the defendant newspaper was to pay MONEY ( RUR ) and each of the applicants and CARDINAL of their co - defendants was to pay RUR CARDINAL . The court also ordered the defendant newspaper to publish a rectification .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicants ' counterclaim on the ground that the plaintiffs had exercised their right to a court and , therefore , had not violated any of the applicants ' rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined an appeal by the applicants and upheld the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL guarantees freedom of thought and expression , together with freedom of the mass media .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that an individual may apply to a court with a request for the rectification of statements ( svedeniya ) that are damaging to his or her honour , dignity or professional reputation if the person who disseminated such statements does not prove their truthfulness . The aggrieved person may also claim compensation for losses and non - pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the dissemination of such statements .", "CARDINAL . The ORG ( in force at the material time ) provided that , in order to be considered damaging , statements had to be untrue and contain allegations of a breach of laws or moral principles ( commission of a dishonest act , improper behaviour at the workplace or in everyday life , etc . ) . Dissemination of statements was understood as the publication of statements or their broadcasting ( section CARDINAL ) . The burden of proof was on the defendant to show that the disseminated statements had been true and accurate ( section CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
