In the NORP education system , after the seventh or eighth grade , when pupils complete their primary education , they can continue either in an ordinary or in a specialised secondary school . The ordinary secondary ORG curriculum does not usually involve the intensive teaching of a special subject such as mathematics , foreign languages or engineering . Enrolment in these schools is on the basis of documents only and does not typically present a problem . The curriculum of the specialised secondary schools does include the teaching of such subjects , and pupils are admitted to them exclusively on the basis of competitive examinations , which take place in DATE ( DATE in GPE starts on DATE ) .

The parents complained that whereas they were paying MONEY for private preparatory lessons , certain pupils had been bragging that they would be admitted to ORG in GPE in exchange for paying ORG CARDINAL ; indeed , DATE this had become a fact . They cited several examples of perfectly healthy children who had been diagnosed as suffering from serious chronic illnesses . They said that they were not blaming the admissions commission , which had merely been taking note of the prior conclusions of medical doctors and allocating the pupils to schools depending on the nature of their purported health problems . They insisted that the ORG should set up a special commission to investigate . A number of parents subsequently staged DATE public protests in front of the building of the GPE education inspectorate .", "CARDINAL . Following this complaint , on DATE the Minister of ORG and ORG appointed CARDINAL officials from ORG to inspect the work of the admissions commission .

In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of having , in the printed press , disseminated injurious statements of fact about , and imputed offences to PERSON , PERSON , Mr PERSON and PERSON , officials carrying out their duties , contrary to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL taken in conjunction with LAW . It applied LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and replaced the applicant \u2019s criminal liability with CARDINAL administrative fines of ORG CARDINAL each . It also ordered the applicant to pay each of the complainants ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for nonpecuniary damage , dismissing the remainder of their claims , and awarded them LAW in costs ( ORG CARDINAL for court fees and ORG CARDINAL for ORG fees ) . Lastly , it ordered the applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL in court fees . The court described its findings of fact and held as follows :", "\u201c In the course of the trial [ the applicant ] gave explanations . It should however be noted that in addition to being evidence the statements of the accused are also a means of defence . [ The applicant ] says that she conducted a journalistic inquiry which is governed by the unwritten rules of conscience and a moral duty to warn society . She had conversations with parents who claimed that some [ pupils ] had arranged for [ their admission ] by paying the commission . [ For example , a pupil ] had boasted that her father had paid [ ORG ] CARDINAL for her admission . At that point the Minister of ORG had already ordered an inquiry into [ such ] allegations . [ The applicant ] does not indicate the names of the parents who gave her information about the payment of specific sums of money to the complainants for the improper admission of their children . Her assertions do not match the remaining evidence , namely [ the testimony of a witness for the complainants and ] the GPE complaint to the Minister . The complaint says that \u2018 other pupils brag in their classes that for MONEY they will be admitted to the LANGUAGE Language Secondary School\u2019 , but does not specify to whom [ this money ] will be given . As regards [ the above - mentioned pupil ] , it is mentioned that she was admitted with a diagnosis of \u2018 chronic pyelonephritis\u2019 and kidney insufficiency although she is an active sportswoman , but this does not automatically lead to the conclusion that [ her ] father paid money to the commission . [ A witness for the applicant ] does not mention the name of a single parent who gave money to have his or her child admitted without an examination , and does not know who may have received such money . The article says \u2018 The sum total of the bribe is MONEY , said the source\u2019 . At trial [ the applicant ] testified that she arrived at this amount by multiplying CARDINAL children by MONEY ( the sum paid by the father of [ the aforementioned pupil ] ) , which came to MONEY .", "[ The applicant ] maintains that another source was [ the head of the GPE education inspectorate ] , who had said \u2018 I will talk if the Minister allows it , I do not stand behind this number of CARDINAL , there may be more\u2019 . [ This witness ] occupied the post of head of [ the GPE inspectorate ] from DATE ] and says that she did not meet [ the applicant ] before the publication of the article on DATE . However , even her [ subsequent ] statement does not contain allegations of corruption .", "In her explanations [ the applicant ] relies on [ Dr N.P. \u2019s ] statements about ORG respective roles in the improper admissions process . [ She alleged ] that [ Mr PERSON , CARDINAL of the complainants ] had put the documents of the [ abovementioned pupil ] before the commission and had said \u2018 She is to be admitted with no questions asked.\u2019 There was also a child diagnosed with having CARDINAL leg QUANTITY shorter than the other who had excellent marks in sport . ORG forms with signatures and seals from various medical centres were available in case of need . When questioned at trial , [ Dr ORG ] said that the documents of the [ pupil diagnosed with chronic pyelonephritis ] were left because the parents and the child were unable to appear in person , which was in any case not required . As regards the blank forms , there was one remaining from DATE ... with an old seal and with no connection to the present commission . The foregoing can not lead to the conclusion that the complainants have committed an offence under LAW [ of LAW : bribetaking ] .", "[ Under LAW of LAW , ] the perpetrator is not punished if he or she proves the truthfulness of the injurious statements of fact disseminated or of the imputation of an offence . The law creates a rebuttable presumption that all injurious statements of fact are false and that all imputed offences have not been committed . That is , the burden of proving the truth [ of these statements ] lies with the accused . An author \u2019s subjective certainty of the truthfulness of his or her assertions does not relieve him or her of liability ; this certainty must be corroborated by objective facts . Neither the truthfulness of the injurious statements nor that of the imputation of an offence was established during the course of the trial . LAW can not therefore be applied .", "The offence proscribed by LAW ] [ seeks to protect ] ORG reputation and public esteem . The opportunities to freely express opinions and to seek , receive and impart information are among the fundamental rights enshrined in LAW ] . LAW [ of LAW ] prohibits the abuse of rights or their exercise in a manner detrimental to the rights and the lawful interests of others . Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL [ of the LAW ] provide that the exercise of the right to express an opinion and the right to information must not be used to the detriment of the rights and reputation of others . The existence of the offence of defamation is a guarantee that the competing rights protected by LAW will not be flouted . The same limitation exists in LAW , which provides that the exercise of these freedoms , since it carries with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a NORP society for the protection of the reputation or rights of others .", "The conduct element of the offence consisted in action . Both forms of the criminal act have been perpetrated : dissemination of untrue injurious statements of fact and imputation of an offence which has not been committed .", "The dissemination ( bringing to the knowledge of third parties ) occurred through an article published in issue CARDINAL of ORG on DATE , under the headline \u2018 Corruption in GPE education!\u2019 and the subheading \u2018 CARDINAL experts and a doctor sacked over bribes?\u2019 , reporting that \u2018 CARDINAL experts of the GPE inspectorate of [ ORG and ORG ] will be sacked for corruption if [ the Minister ] heeds the findings made by his representatives after an inquiry conducted following a bribetaking ORG , [ and mentioning ] \u2018 the children in respect of whom money was ORG . It was established that the internal inquiry was not carried out pursuant to an alert about bribetaking by the commission , but in relation to breaches of [ the school admission regulations ] . The experts were simply taking note of the diagnoses already made by [ specialised medical commissions in charge of assessing degrees of disability ] . The [ assertion ] that they will be dismissed for corruption , and that the commission was checked up on following a bribetaking alert is injurious . In her statement at trial [ the applicant ] says that before writing the article she did not acquaint herself with the GPE complaint or with the report of ORG internal inquiry .", "The defence objects that the statements of fact featuring in the article can not be characterised as injurious because the matter involves proven wrongdoings : the word \u2018 corruption\u2019 as used in the article is not equivalent to bribetaking , but rather implies the existence of serious violations in the admission of pupils . The court finds this argument unconvincing . [ The article specifically says ] not only that the [ complainants would be ] sacked , but [ also ] that the inspection [ was carried out ] following \u2018 information about bribetaking\u2019 .", "The imputation of an offence consists in the [ applicant \u2019s ] allegations , made in an article published in issue CARDINAL of ORG on DATE under the headline \u2018 Corruption in GPE education!\u2019 , and the subheadline \u2018 CARDINAL experts and a doctor sacked over bribes?\u2019 , stating : \u2018 For each child admitted via the \u2018 ORG route the experts pocketed CARDINAL [ GPE ] dollars . The sum total of the bribe is MONEY , said the source\u2019 [ and ] \u2018 The experts incriminated in the corruption are [ Mr PERSON ] , [ Ms A.M. ] , [ Mr G.D. ] and [ PERSON ] of the vocational education ORG", "The allegation concerned an offence under LAW [ of LAW ] . The abovementioned evidence did not show that an offence under LAW [ the LAW ] \u2013 bribetaking DATE had been committed . [ A witness for the applicant ] does not say which parent gave money to whom ; in their letter to ORG ... the parents specifically wrote \u2018 We are not making any allegations against the commission of the [ ORG \u2019s ] regional inspectorate , as it merely notes down the conclusions of the [ special medical commission ] and assigns pupils with health problems to different schools depending on the type of ORG ; [ a further witness for the applicant ] confirmed the contents of this letter . As regards the source mentioned in the quotation , at trial [ the applicant ] said that she had arrived at the sum of CARDINAL [ GPE ] dollars by multiplying CARDINAL children by MONEY , i.e. she was not quoting any source . It can be seen from [ the Minister \u2019s reply to a question in ORG ] that \u2018 ORG and ORG has received no reports naming officials alleged to have perpetrated acts of corruption , and we are therefore not in a position to refer the matter to the prosecuting authorities for investigation.\u2019", "Defamation is an offence requiring resultant harm . In the instant case this condition has been fulfilled , because third parties have learnt of the injurious statements and the imputed offence .", "The form of mens rea was direct intent ... [ The applicant ] understood the antisocial character of her act , foresaw its dangerous consequences and wished them to occur . She was aware of the injurious character of what she wrote and knew that by imputing an offence to the complainants she would injure their reputation . She must have known that alongside her immediate purpose \u2013 informing society \u2013 she would bring about the antisocial result of impinging on another \u2019s legal sphere by making discrediting allegations .", "[ The applicant ] has fulfilled the conduct and fault elements of the offence under LAW ( [ CARDINAL ] ) and ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL in conjunction with LAW [ of LAW ] by", "CARDINAL . ... disseminating injurious statements of fact about , and imputing an offence to , [ PERSON ] , an official carrying out her duties , in the printed press .", "CARDINAL . ... disseminating injurious statements of fact about , and imputing an offence to , [ Ms A.M. ] , an official carrying out her duties , in the printed press .", "CARDINAL . ... disseminating injurious statements of fact about , and imputing an offence to , [ Mr GPE ] , an official carrying out his duties , in the printed press .", "CARDINAL . ... disseminating injurious statements of fact about , and imputing an offence to , [ Mr G.D. ] , an official carrying out his duties , in the printed press .", "DETERMINATION OF THE PUNISHMENT", "The [ applicant \u2019s ] offence is punishable by a fine ranging from MONEY and public reprimand .

In view of this , the court accepts that all the formal prerequisites are in place for it to apply the imperative rule of Article ORG and waive [ the applicant \u2019s ] criminal liability , as the aims of the punishment [ as defined in LAW ] may be achieved through the [ simple ] imposition of an administrative penalty .", "In determining the quantum of the punishment DATE the fine \u2013 the court had regard to the gravity of the [ applicant \u2019s ] act , her personality and her motivation [ for committing the offence ] .", "In view of the foregoing , the court considers that the aims of the punishment can be fully attained by imposing an administrative penalty in the form of a fine of LAW in respect of each of the offences .", "In assessing the dangerousness of the offence and of the offender the court had regard to [ the applicant \u2019s ] criminal record \u2013 she has not been convicted DATE , the relatively serious nature of her offence , her motives and the character of her act , its consequences , [ and her ] degree of culpability .

They also specified that they sought ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL each . The court accordingly discontinued the proceedings in respect of the dropped charges and allowed the amendment of the civil claim ; it also heard the parties\u2019 closing arguments . Counsel for the applicant produced a brief prepared by LAW , an international nongovernmental organisation defending freedom of speech . The court refused to admit it to the file . It admitted in evidence a certificate issued by the GPE prosecuting authorities stating that criminal proceedings had been instituted against officials of the regional inspectorate of ORG and ORG following allegations of bribetaking ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In a brief filed on DATE and largely coinciding with his oral arguments at the hearing , counsel for the applicant cited a number of this ORG \u2019s judgments and argued that ORG had erred by concentrating solely on the acts alleged against the complainants and , accordingly , on the availability of sufficient proof of bribetaking . If it had read and analysed properly the full text of the article \u2013 which contained many phrases removing certainty from the allegations and distancing the applicant from them \u2013 it would have found that she had not asserted that bribetaking had taken place . Moreover , the court had ruled ultra petita , as , in finding the article defamatory , it had relied on a phrase not pleaded by the complainants \u2013 \u201c the children in respect of whom money was paid \u201d . It had also erred by holding that the applicant had perpetrated both forms of defamation DATE disseminating injurious statements of fact and imputing an offence \u2013 , and by holding that speculating about a future event \u2013 the dismissal \u2013 could amount to an allegation of fact . Furthermore , the facts asserted by the applicant \u2013 the existence of signs of bribetaking \u2013 were true . An internal inquiry had indeed taken place . It had found that numerous serious violations had occurred which could hardly be explained by professional negligence alone . There were indications that parents had given money to obtain admission for their children . While all of these indeed constituted only prima facie evidence of bribe - taking , this was all the applicant had claimed . She had acted in good faith , checking her sources . Although she had been aware that she might upset certain people , she had decided to go to print in the best interests of the children who had not been admitted . She had done so in an urgent situation , going to press DATE before the start of DATE . She had made public a story which was the subject of lively discussion in the town , and had achieved a positive effect , preventing future instances of corruption . The court had to take into account all these factors and assess the necessity of the interference with the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression in concreto .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence . It found that the lower court had erroneously failed to rule on the charges relating to the CARDINAL articles of DATE and DATE , but that the ORG withdrawal of these charges had made the error good and had obviated the need to correct it . It also found that , because of the partial withdrawal of the charges and the related reduction and detailing of the ORG damages claims , there was no need for it to rectify the lower court \u2019s failure to determine which part of the damages was awarded in respect of which article . The court continued :", "\u201c Having fully reviewed [ the lower court \u2019s ] judgment ... [ this court ] finds that the appeals are ILLFOUNDED .", "The overall assessment of the oral and written evidence gathered by the [ lower court ] confirms the facts as set out in detail in [ its ] judgment ...", "...", "In reviewing [ the applicant \u2019s ] act , which consisted in the writing of the [ impugned article ] , [ the lower court ] correctly held that [ her offence ] was committed by action . [ She ] fulfilled the conduct elements of both forms of the offence of defamation , as in her article she disseminated the injurious untrue statement of fact ... that the persons named in the article \u2013 the CARDINAL complainants \u2013 \u2018 WILL BE SACKED FOR CORRUPTION\u2019 and at the same time imputed to them an offence which they had not committed , telling her readers that \u2018 FOR EACH CHILD ADMITTED ORG THE \u2018 ALTERNATIVE\u2019 ROUTE THE EXPERTS POCKETED AT CARDINAL [ ORG STATES ] CARDINAL . THE SUM TOTAL OF THE BRIBE IS ABOUT CARDINAL ... THE EXPERTS INCRIMINATED IN THE CORRUPTION ARE [ MR GPE ] , [ MS A.M. ] , [ PERSON ] AND [ ORG T.K.]\u2019 . It is true that ... in its reasons ... [ the lower court ] , citing the article , also mentioned the phrase \u2018 the children in respect of whom money was paid\u2019 . This does not however mean that [ the lower court ] ventured outside the [ charges brought by the complainants ] , relying on a phrase which [ the latter did not find fault with ] , as incorrectly argued by the defence . If [ the lower court ] had relied on this phrase it would have found the applicant criminally liable for it . [ However , it can be seen from its reasoning ] that it held that the injurious statement of fact was \u2018 the [ assertion ] that they would be dismissed for corruption , and that the commission was checked on following a bribetaking alert . [ The lower court did not find ] the phrase \u2018 the children in respect of whom money was paid\u2019 to amount to an injurious assertion of fact or an imputation of an offence , and the objection in this regard is unfounded .", "The argument of the defence that the phrase \u2018 will be sacked for corruption\u2019 concerns an uncertain future event and not a fact , and that , accordingly , it can not amount to defamation is groundless . Analysis of the impugned phrases shows that the ORG supposed impending dismissal for being corrupt ( which is asserted as a fact ) is an injurious statement because it affects their personalities and is liable to tarnish their reputations . The legal conclusions would be completely different if [ the applicant ] had merely stated \u2018 they will be ORG without mentioning the specific reason for that , namely corruption . This word undoubtedly refers to the ORG conduct and attributes negative qualities to them , characterising them negatively in their capacity as individuals and public officials . [ The applicant ] , in her capacity as the author of the article , told the readers of the newspaper that the impending dismissal of the complainants was on account of corruption , which was presented as a fact in the article , that is , as something that had already happened , something real . It is exactly this which makes the news of their future dismissal injurious . Moreover , from a legal viewpoint , future events as well as negative facts in which an event is lacking are nonetheless facts . The use of the future tense does not therefore exculpate [ the applicant ] , but should rather be taken as a mitigating circumstance , justifying a lesser penalty ... Undoubtedly the negative consequences flowing from the defamatory assertion of a future dismissal ( as stated in the article ) are less than those flowing from a dismissal already carried out for corruption . However , in both cases the author undermines the good name of the person and their positive reputation . For similar reasons , the criminal nature of the act depends little on whether [ the applicant ] used the expression \u2018 accused of GPE or \u2018 NORP . The opinion of the defence that an allegation is defamatory , that is , capable of damaging the ORG reputations only in the latter case is not shared by [ this court ] .", "With the second impugned phrase [ the applicant ] imputed to the complainants an identifiable serious intentional offence , namely bribe - taking ( LAW seq . [ of LAW ] ) . [ The lower court ] , in line with the established caselaw and the prevailing morality , correctly found that this also characterises negatively the personalities of the complainants . As a rule , an offence , as an antisocial , guilty and punishable act , ... is in all cases reprehensible from a moral viewpoint and without exception reflects negatively on the personality of its perpetrator . For this reason , [ the applicant \u2019s ] assertion that as a result of a bribe the complainants received MONEY categorically affects their good names and dignity as citizens and professionals . It was thus properly characterised as defamatory by [ the lower court ] . The argument of the defence that the impugned article did not contain allegations that the complainants had accepted bribes was correctly rejected as unfounded by [ the lower court ] . In the article [ the applicant ] unequivocally explained to readers the reason for and the amount of the bribe , specifying that \u2018 for each child admitted via the \u2018 ORG route the experts pocketed MONEY . The sum total of the bribe is CARDINAL ORG .", "As to the [ applicant \u2019s ] defence that the information in the article was true , the court finds this defence untenable . No evidence proving in an incontrovertible manner the truth of the injurious assertion that the complainants would be dismissed for corruption has been gathered , either by the [ lower court ] or before the adoption of [ this court \u2019s ] judgment . The [ CARDINAL orders ] of DATE show that the complainants were indeed disciplined after the publication of the article . However , they were not dismissed but merely given a warning of dismissal , which is obviously not the same thing . There is no indication whatsoever that their dismissal was proposed or discussed . They were penalised for the numerous violations committed by them in the course of their work as members of the commission for assigning pupils with chronic illnesses and/or special educational needs to specialised secondary schools , not for engaging in corrupt practices . It has not been established that the complainants committed the offence of bribetaking . For this reason , the [ lower court ] correctly refused to apply LAW [ of LAW ] . This provision states that [ persons making allegedly defamatory allegations ] are not to be punished if they prove the truth of the injurious statements or the imputation of an offence . In view of the presumption of innocence [ enshrined in LAW and LAW ] , and in the absence of a final conviction establishing that the complainants committed the offence of bribetaking , the [ lower court \u2019s ] conclusion that the prerequisites of LAW ... have not been met is correct and lawful . Only a final conviction is capable of establishing the truth of [ the applicant \u2019s ] assertion that the complainants committed the offence of bribetaking .", "In view of its duty ... to gather not only incriminating , but also exculpating and mitigating evidence , [ the lower court ] reviewed the availability of information to the effect that the complainants had committed the imputed offence , that is , taken bribes . This approach by [ the lower court ] was in [ the applicant \u2019s ] interest , in view of the rule embodied in LAW [ of the LAW ] . The defence is therefore mistaken in its belief that [ the lower court ] erred by examining the ORG acts . [ That court ] also discussed in detail [ the applicant \u2019s ] act and , as can be seen from the operative provisions of its judgment , correctly found that her acts , and not those of the complainants as incorrectly argued by the defence , were the subjectmatter of the case .", "[ A certificate issued ] by the GPE regional prosecutor \u2019s office ... shows that [ this office ] opened [ an inquiry ] into the unlawful admission of pupils ... by a commission of the [ GPE regional inspectorate of ORG and ORG ] during the DATE . After completing the inquiry [ the prosecuting authorities ] instituted [ a criminal investigation ] against officials of [ the inspectorate ] suspected of having taken bribes ... However , the certificate does not say whether these officials were the complainants . [ In any event , ] this does not alter [ the lower court \u2019s ] conclusion that [ the applicant \u2019s ] act was contrary to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL in conjunction with LAW [ of LAW ] , a conclusion which is fully shared by [ this court ] . Even if it were to be assumed that these criminal proceedings for bribery were directed against the complainants in their capacity as members and ... chairman of the commission ... , this fact alone is not enough to rebut the presumption of innocence and establish the truth of the injurious statements and the imputation of an offence , because the conclusion of these criminal proceedings by a final conviction of the CARDINAL complainants of the offence of bribery is an uncertain future event . It is not disputed between the parties that at the time of the adoption of [ this court \u2019s ] judgment the criminal proceedings against the complainants are pending at the pre - trial stage . The ongoing nature of the investigation does not constitute grounds for adjourning the instant case until its completion , in view of the legal timelimits for concluding the criminal proceedings , which , if excessive in length , may engender a real risk that the absolute limitation period for prosecuting [ the applicant ] will expire . An adjournment of the case is therefore unacceptable , because it would deprive the complainants of the right to obtain a judicial determination of the charges levelled by them owing to the expiry of the limitation period for prosecuting the offence [ allegedly ] committed by [ the applicant ] . Nor do the criminal proceedings pending against the complainants constitute grounds for staying the proceedings in the instant case , although the outcome of the investigation concerning them is of great importance for [ the applicant \u2019s ] liability and the application of LAW [ of LAW ] . The court may stay a criminal case only in a limited number of situations [ envisaged by LAW ] . The existence of a criminal investigation against the complainants , the outcome of which is determinative for the resolution of the present case , is not such a situation . There are , then , no grounds for staying the proceedings in the instant case pending completion of the criminal proceedings against the complainants . It follows that , in so far as it has not been properly established that the complainants committed the imputed corrupt acts , [ this court ] endorses [ the lower court \u2019s ] conclusion that [ the applicant \u2019s ] act amounted to defamation contrary to LAW ) and ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL in conjunction with LAW of LAW ] .", "It is conceivable that the criminal proceedings against the complainants may end in a final conviction ... [ Their conviction ] would undoubtedly establish the truth of the injurious statements disseminated and of the imputation of an offence , as required under LAW [ of LAW ] . If that were to happen , [ the applicant ] could request the proceedings to be reopened and [ the judgments against her ] to be set aside , relying on the existence of a new fact which was not known to [ the courts trying her case ] . For these reasons , the information in the certificate issued by the prosecuting authorities is only an indication that there were grounds for investigating officials of the [ regional inspectorate of ORG and ORG ] for corruption , but it by no means disproves the charge that the injurious statements and the imputation of an offence were false . The defence \u2019s contention that the proving of the injurious statements obeys the normal rules on distribution of the burden of proof in criminal proceedings is incorrect and illogical precisely because of the ORG interest in proving their charge . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL [ of LAW ] provides that the burden of proof ... is on the private prosecuting party . [ The applicant ] is not required to prove her innocence . However , in the circumstances , seeing that the complainants have no interest in triggering the application of LAW [ of LAW ] , because this would lead to the non - imposition of the punishment they seek , it has to be accepted that the burden of proof shifts to [ the applicant ] . [ The lower court \u2019s ] conclusions on this point are correct . Of course , ... [ the applicant ] does not have the onus of proving the charges , but merely the existence of the prerequisites for not punishing her under LAW [ of LAW ] . The burden of proving the charges rests with the complainants .", "As to [ the applicant \u2019s ] objection that [ she acted without mens rea ] , [ this court ] accepts the defence \u2019s argument that [ the applicant ] did not act with direct intent to defame the complainants ... as incorrectly held by [ the lower court ] . However , as a whole the objection that she acted without mens rea and thus did not commit an offence is groundless . In reply to the ORG rebuttal of the article , published in ORG on DATE , in the same issue of the newspaper [ the applicant ] wrote a note in her capacity as the article \u2019s author . Part of the content of this note : \u2018 Dear ladies and gentlemen educationalists , please accept my apologies if I have offended you by imputing to you acts that you did not ORG , as well as [ the applicant \u2019s ] explanation [ at trial ] that she did not write the article with the intention of offending anyone , lead the court to accept that [ she ] perpetrated the offence with oblique intent ... She was aware of the antisocial character of her act . She foresaw its harmful consequences , namely that the newspaper \u2019s readers would learn of her assertions that the complainants were to be dismissed for corruption and about the offence of bribery imputed to them , which would inevitably negatively affect their reputations . [ The applicant ] did not wish these harmful consequences to occur as a direct result of her act . However , in pursuing her direct , and in principle noble , goal not to allow children to suffer detriment in the process of applying for admission to elite secondary schools , she knowingly accepted that these consequences would inevitably occur . This positive attitude towards the result of the offence makes her act unlawful .", "In order not to have the intention of committing defamation , the accused must be certain , on the basis of objective facts , that the injurious statements or the imputation are true . The information contained in the testimony of [ a witness for the applicant ] and the article in the issue of ORG under the headline \u2018 Bribes scandal in GPE secondary schools\u2019 ... , in which the complainants are accused of corruption , is not based on such objective facts . It could not give [ the applicant ] a justified assurance that the injurious statements and the imputation were true . [ The lower court ] remarked correctly that not a single parent or pupil who gave such information to the applicant had been named . The [ abovementioned witness for the applicant ] does not say which parents of children who were denied admission complained to him that \u2018 sums of CARDINAL GPE ] dollars were pocketed to allow in [ healthy ] children instead of sick ones\u2019 ... Contrary to her assertions , [ the applicant ] did not carry out a proper journalistic inquiry before drafting her article . [ Her assertions ] that she received the information from the parents of children who were not admitted ( which were not corroborated by the testimony of any parent ) and that the information in the article ... in DATE issue of ORG confirmed the allegations in the impugned article do not lend support to [ her ] argument that she \u2018 complied with all possible requirements of goodfaith ORG . In accordance with the principle that journalists have to be objective , proper journalistic inquiry requires them to check the reliability of their sources . In the instant case , [ the applicant ] could have asked the [ ORG and ORG ] about the reasons behind and the content of the [ GPE ] letter mentioned in the article in ORG . Counsel for [ the applicant ] mistakenly objects that [ she ] had not been made aware that [ the ORG ] had received an alert from protesting parents . In line CARDINAL of the impugned article [ the applicant ] pointed out that [ the ORG \u2019s internal inquiry ] had been ordered by [ the Minister ] pursuant to \u2018 an ALERT concerning bribetaking\u2019 . She was obviously aware of an alert ( a letter ) received by [ the ORG ] . There is no indication in the case file that any of the protesting parents or children with whom [ the applicant ] claims she conversed many times said that the complainants had engaged in corrupt acts . If [ the applicant ] had checked what alert had been received by [ the ORG ] and the exact reason why [ the Minister ] had ordered an [ internal inquiry ] , she would have no doubt reached a different conclusion . The protesting parents complained about \u2018 the ruthless race between doctors to earn more money by giving false diagnoses to minors applying for admission to secondary schools\u2019 ... It is not disputed that none of the complainants is a medical doctor . Clearly , then , the protests were directed against the actions of the doctors , not against those of the commission of which the CARDINAL complainants were members . No complaints of corrupt acts on the part of the complainants from parents , pupils or officials were received by [ the Ministry ] or by the [ newly ] formed \u2018 ORG for the Salvation of Burgas\u2019 , of which [ the abovementioned witness ] is a member . [ When giving evidence at trial , this witness ] testified about a complaint which he had received from CARDINAL or QUANTITY individuals who had confided that they had each given CARDINAL [ GPE ] dollars to a member of the commission . He had shared this information with [ the applicant ] . The information did not , however , contain objective facts capable of convincing [ the applicant ] as a journalist of the truthfulness of what she wrote in the article and thus absolving her of any intention to defame . On the CARDINAL hand , [ the witness ] did not name any specific individual who was in a position to confirm his words , and , on the other , the corruption complaint concerned CARDINAL ( unidentified ) member of the commission , not all CARDINAL complainants as asserted in the article . It should also be noted that there was a further member of the commission who is not a complainant [ in this case ] , the witness PERSON The [ internal inquiry ] carried out following complaints by parents had the task of checking whether the complainants had , as members of the commission , complied with [ certain Ministry regulations ] , not whether they had taken bribes . For these reasons , [ the court ] finds no force in the defence \u2019s argument that [ the applicant \u2019s ] intent did not comprise the inaccuracy of the injurious statements disseminated and of the imputation of an offence . Even though the sources ... mentioned by [ the applicant ] herself could not , in the circumstances , have assured [ her ] of the reality of the situation , [ she ] wrote the impugned article . As correctly found by [ the lower court ] , [ the applicant ] did not use a source for the amount of the bribe \u2013 \u2018 CARDINAL [ GPE ] ORG \u2013 , but made the calculation herself by multiplying CARDINAL children by MONEY . The above shows that the journalistic objectivity and thorough research required of each publication were lacking .", "As regards [ the applicant \u2019s ] complaint that the conviction and sentence infringed her freedom to express her opinions and impart information , [ the lower court ] has given weighty reasons why this complaint is unfounded , in view of [ the applicant \u2019s ] unacceptable infringement of the ORG competing fundamental and hence constitutionally guaranteed right under LAW ] to a good name . [ The lower court ] correctly referred to and construed Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of [ the LAW ] and LAW of LAW , and rightly held that [ the applicant \u2019s ] right to impart information could not be used to infringe the rights and the good name of the complainants in the manner described above . Analysis of these provisions and of the rules of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL et seq . [ of LAW ] defining the offences concerned and enacted to guarantee compliance with the above provisions , makes it clear that journalists must exercise their constitutional right to express opinions and impart information in a way which excludes the commission of the offences of insult or defamation . Naturally , the principles of democracy and freedom of speech , as well as the public interest , require journalists to be able to publish in the media facts established as a result of proper journalistic inquiries , even though these facts may damage people \u2019s reputations . However , journalists must verify the truthfulness of their statements by using every available means to check the reliability of the information [ they ] receive . [ The applicant ] failed to do so despite having the objective opportunity . The wording of LAW [ of LAW ] shows that in their articles journalists may disseminate injurious statements of fact or impute offences to others without fearing punishment , provided that they are able to prove the veracity of their assertions .", "[ This court ] fully accepts the defence argument that through her actions [ the applicant ] sought to safeguard the interest of the public and in particular , as averred by her , the interests of the seventyfour children who had applied for admission to secondary schools . Motivation is , however , not an exculpating circumstance , but only a mitigating one ...", "For these reasons , [ the lower court ] was correct in holding that [ the applicant ] met the conduct and fault criteria ... of the offence of defamation ...", "Concerning the punishment : [ The lower court ] correctly applied the substantive law , as the prerequisites of Article CARDINALa [ of LAW ] are met in respect of each of [ the applicant \u2019s ] offences . The quantum of the administrative punishments was also set correctly ... The [ ORG ] request for harsher penalties than those imposed by [ the lower court ] is illfounded in view of the additional mitigating circumstances noted by this court . These are the specific motivation , the form of the mens rea and the applicant \u2019s use of the future ( that is , uncertain ) tense . Taken together with the mitigating circumstances already noted by [ the lower court ] , these warrant imposing less than the maximum penalty . The fact that the complainants are public officials is not a reason to allow their appeal either , because this aggravating circumstance has already been taken into account in framing the elements of the offence . On the other hand , the fact that the offence imputed to the complainants was a serious and intentional one shows that [ the applicant \u2019s ] act was highly dangerous and makes it unacceptable to reduce the penalties imposed by [ the lower court ] to below the average .", "As regards the civil claims , this court fully shares the reasons given by [ the lower court ] for finding [ the applicant ] liable in tort for the damage caused ... to each of the complainants . [ The lower court \u2019s ] opinion that an award of ORG MONEY to each of [ the complainants ] is just fully coincides with [ this court \u2019s ] notion of equity . The award should therefore not be increased as requested by the complainants .", "[ The lower court \u2019s ] judgment is wellfounded and lawful and must therefore be upheld . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also ordered the applicant to pay the ORG costs for the appeal proceedings , amounting to ORG CARDINAL for each of them .", "CARDINAL . All CARDINAL complainants issued enforcement proceedings against the applicant to recover the damages awarded to them . As a result , each of them obtained payment of ORG CARDINAL .
