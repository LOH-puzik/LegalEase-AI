Mr GPE , Mr NORP and PERSON , all NORP citizens , were born in DATE and DATE respectively . Mr ORG died on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , in the course of routine investigations into other matters , the police came into possession of a number of video films which were made during sado - masochistic encounters involving the applicants and CARDINAL other homosexual men . As a result the applicants , with several other men , were charged with a series of offences , including assault and wounding , relating to sado - masochistic activities that had taken place over a DATE period . CARDINAL of the charges involved a defendant who was not yet DATE - the age of consent to male homosexual practices at the time . Although the instances of assault were very numerous , the prosecution limited the counts to a small number of exemplary charges .", "The acts consisted in the main of maltreatment of the genitalia ( with , for example , hot wax , sandpaper , fish hooks and needles ) and ritualistic beatings either with the assailant \u2019s bare hands or a variety of implements , including stinging nettles , spiked belts and a cat - o\u2019-nine tails . There were instances of branding and infliction of injuries which resulted in the flow of blood and which left scarring .", "These activities were consensual and were conducted in private for no apparent purpose other than the achievement of sexual gratification . The infliction of pain was subject to certain rules including the provision of a code word to be used by any \" victim \" to stop an \" assault \" , and did not lead to any instances of infection , permanent injury or the need for medical attention .", "CARDINAL . ORG The activities took place at a number of locations , including rooms equipped as torture chambers . Video cameras were used to record events and the tapes copied and distributed amongst members of the group . The prosecution was largely based on the contents of those videotapes . There was no suggestion that the tapes had been sold or used other than by members of the group .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicants pleaded guilty to the assault charges after the trial judge ruled that they could not rely on the consent of the \" victims \" as an answer to the prosecution case .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the defendants were convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment . On passing sentence , the trial judge commented : \" ... the unlawful conduct now before the court would be dealt with equally in the prosecution of heterosexuals or bisexuals if carried out by them . The homosexuality of the defendants is only the background against which the case must be viewed . \"", "Mr ORG was sentenced to imprisonment for DATE and DATE . This included a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for aiding and abetting keeping a disorderly house ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and a consecutive term of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for possession of an indecent photograph of a child . Under section CARDINAL of the ORG against LAW ( \" LAW \" - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , Mr ORG also received concurrent sentences of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment in respect of various counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and aiding and abetting assault occasioning actual bodily harm .", "CARDINAL .

Since , however , the court found that the applicants did not appreciate that their actions in inflicting injuries were criminal , reduced sentences were imposed .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr ORG \u2019s sentence was thus reduced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment as regards the charge of aiding and abetting keeping a disorderly house .

ORG Mr NORP \u2019s and PERSON sentences were reduced to CARDINAL months\u2019 and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment respectively .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicants appealed to ORG on the following certified point of law of public importance :", "\" Where A wounds or assaults B occasioning him actual bodily harm in the course of a sado - masochistic encounter , does the prosecution have to prove lack of consent on the part of B before they can establish A \u2019s guilt under LAW or section CARDINAL of LAW ? \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the appeal , known as the case of NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) , was dismissed by a majority of ORG , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL law lords dissenting .", "CARDINAL . Lord Templeman , in the majority , held after reviewing the case - law that :", "\" ... the authorities dealing with the intentional infliction of bodily harm do not establish that consent is a defence to a charge under LAW . They establish that consent is a defence to the infliction of bodily harm in the course of some lawful activities . The question is whether the defence should be extended to the infliction of bodily harm in the course of sado - masochistic encounters ...", "Counsel for the appellants argued that consent should provide a defence ... because it was said every person has a right to deal with his own body as he chooses . I do not consider that this slogan provides a sufficient guide to the policy decision which must now be taken . It is an offence for a person to abuse his own body and mind by taking drugs . Although the law is often broken , the criminal law restrains a practice which is regarded as dangerous and injurious to individuals and which if allowed and extended is harmful to society generally . In any event the appellants in this case did not mutilate their own bodies . They inflicted harm on willing victims ...", "In principle there is a difference between violence which is incidental and violence which is inflicted for the indulgence of cruelty . The violence of sado - masochistic encounters involves the indulgence of cruelty by sadists and the degradation of victims . Such violence is injurious to the participants and unpredictably dangerous . I am not prepared to invent a defence of consent for sado - masochistic encounters which breed and glorify cruelty ...", "Society is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence . Pleasure derived from the infliction of pain is an evil thing . Cruelty is uncivilised . \"", "CARDINAL . Lord GPE of GPE found that :", "\" In my view the line falls properly to be drawn between assault at common law and the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm created by LAW , with the result that consent of the victim is no answer to anyone charged with the latter offence ... unless the circumstances fall within CARDINAL of the well known exceptions such as organised sporting contests or games , parental chastisement or reasonable surgery ... the infliction of actual or more serious bodily harm is an unlawful activity to which consent is no answer .", "... Notwithstanding the views which I have come to , I think it right to say something about the submissions that consent to the activity of the appellants would not be injurious to the public interest .", "Considerable emphasis was placed by the appellants on the well - ordered and secret manner in which their activities were conducted and upon the fact that these activities had resulted in no injuries which required medical attention . There was , it was said , no question of proselytising by the appellants . This latter submission sits ill with the following passage in the judgment of the Lord Chief Justice :", "\u2018 They [ ORG and PERSON ] recruited new participants ; they jointly organised proceedings at the house where much of this activity took place ; where much of the pain inflicting equipment was stored .", "PERSON was a voyeur rather than a sado - masochist , but both he and ORG through their operations at the PERSON premises were responsible in part for the corruption of a youth \" K \" who is now it seems settled into a normal heterosexual relationship.\u2019", "Be that as it may , in considering the public interest it would be wrong to look only at the activities of the appellants alone , there being no suggestion that they and their associates are the only practitioners of homosexual sado - masochism in GPE and GPE . This ORG must therefore consider the possibility that these activities are practised by others and by others who are not so controlled or responsible as the appellants are claiming to be . Without going into details of all the rather curious activities in which the appellants engaged it would appear to be good luck rather than good judgment which has prevented serious injury from occurring . Wounds can easily become septic if not properly treated , the free flow of blood from a person who is HIV - positive or who has AIDS can infect another and an inflicter who is carried away by sexual excitement or by drink or drugs could very easily inflict pain and injury beyond the level to which the receiver had consented . Your Lordships have no information as to whether such situations have occurred in relation to other sadomasochistic practitioners . It was no doubt these dangers which caused PERSON to restrict her propositions in relation to the public interest to the actual rather than the potential result of the activity . In my view such a restriction is quite unjustified . When considering the public interest potential for harm is just as relevant as actual harm . As PERSON said in Coney CARDINAL Queen \u2019s Bench CARDINAL , CARDINAL :", "\u2018 There is however abundant authority for saying that no consent can render that innocent which is in fact dangerous.\u2019", "Furthermore , the possibility of proselytisation and corruption of young men is a real danger even in the case of these appellants and the taking of video recordings of such activities suggests that secrecy may not be as strict as the appellants claimed to your Lordships . \"", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON of GPE dissented . The first considered that the case should not be treated as falling within the criminal law of violence but rather within the criminal law of private sexual relations . He gave weight to the arguments of the appellants concerning LAW ( article CARDINAL) , finding that the decisions of the NORP authorities clearly favoured the right of the appellants to conduct their private life undisturbed by the criminal law . He considered after an examination of the relevant case - law that it was appropriate for ORG to tackle afresh the question whether public interest required penalising the infliction of this degree of harm in private on a consenting recipient , where the purpose was not profit but gratification of sexual desire . He found no convincing argument on grounds of health ( alleged risk of infections or spread of AIDS ) , the alleged risk of the activities getting out of hand or any possible risk of corruption of youth which might require the offences under LAW to be interpreted as applying to this conduct .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON of GPE found that as the law stood adults were able to consent to acts done in private which did not result in serious bodily harm . He agreed that it was in the end a matter of policy in an area where social and moral factors were extremely important and where attitudes could change . It was however for the legislature to decide whether such conduct should be brought within the criminal law and not for the courts in the interests of \" paternalism \" to introduce into existing statutory crimes relating to offences against the person concepts which did not properly fit there .", "CARDINAL . ORG The proceedings were given widespread press coverage . All the applicants lost their jobs and Mr NORP required extensive psychiatric treatment .", "CARDINAL .

ORG In Attorney - General \u2019s Reference ( No . CARDINAL of DATE ) ( [ DATE ] ORG Bench Reports , at CARDINAL ) where CARDINAL men quarrelled and decided to fight each other , Lord PERSON in ORG had held :", "\" It is not in the public interest that people should try to cause or should cause each other actual bodily harm for no good reason . Minor struggles are another matter . So , in our judgment , it is immaterial whether the act occurs in private or in public ; it is an assault if actual bodily harm is intended and/or caused . This means that most fights will be unlawful regardless of consent . Nothing which we have said is intended to cast doubt upon the accepted legality of properly conducted games and sports , lawful chastisement or correction , reasonable surgical interference , dangerous exhibitions , etc . These apparent exceptions can be justified as involving the exercise of a legal right , in the case of chastisement or correction , or as needed in the public interest , in the other cases . \"", "CARDINAL .
