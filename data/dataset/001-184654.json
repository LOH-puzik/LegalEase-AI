In that connection , he alleged that a deal had been done so that \u201c the land would be given to people who had close family or party ties \u201d with the Prime Minister . As described in the trial court \u2019s judgment ( see below ) , the applicant stated that :", "\u201c The attractive location behind the \u2018 PERSON shopping mall planned for the construction of a hotel was granted to a company supported ( \u0437\u0430\u0434 \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438 ) by ORG ...

Relying on the latter \u2019s testimony , the court held that the applicant \u2019s allegations had concerned Mr PERSON , regardless of the fact that he had not been identified by name . That was because the applicant had previously given false statements about Mr PERSON and had often referred to him as \u201c the Prime Minister \u2019s cousin \u201d . Mr PERSON admitted that he had had contact with the managers of ORG , although that had been as friends .
