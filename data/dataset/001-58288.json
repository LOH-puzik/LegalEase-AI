Until the French Revolution of CARDINAL the right to hunt was a privilege of the nobility . Only nobles could take game , which was regarded as the lord \u2019s property .", "During the Revolution there were CARDINAL schools of thought on the question . The first approach , supported by PERSON , was to make the right to hunt the prerogative of the landowner alone ; the second , which was advocated by PERSON , was to give all citizens unconditional freedom to hunt everywhere . The first approach carried DATE , as in TIME DATE the privilege of hunting was abolished \u201c subject to the sole reservation that landowners alone may hunt \u201d and a decree of CARDINAL DATE laid down the principle that \u201c Every landowner has the right to destroy or cause to be destroyed , on his property only , any species of game \u201d .", "Subsequently the LAW DATE , a large part of which is still in force , regulated the right to hunt by introducing hunting licences and laying down fixed hunting seasons . LAW , which was later codified as LAW and then LAW , provided : \u201c No one shall have the right to hunt on land belonging to another without the consent of the owner or any person entitled through or under the owner . \u201d", "However , it was made clear by case - law that this consent could be tacit and that it was possible to hunt on another \u2019s land provided that the owner of the hunting rights had not expressly manifested his opposition by means of measures such as signing a lease , swearing in a gamekeeper or putting up \u201c private hunting \u201d notices .", "CARDINAL . NORP Although , in an attempt to organise hunting , associations of hunters were set up spontaneously in the regions north of the LOC where large estates of agricultural land or woodland predominated , the theory of tacit consent derived from case - law led throughout the south of GPE , where sub - division of landholdings has created a pattern of much smaller properties , to an almost unlimited freedom to hunt , known as \u201c chasse banale \u201d ( public hunting ) . With the exception of a few private hunting grounds , hunters could thus hunt wherever they pleased and no one was responsible for the proper management of game stocks ; as a result game species in certain regions were decimated .", "CARDINAL . It was in those circumstances that PERSON no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , known as the \u201c PERSON \u201d , was enacted ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) . This provided for the creation of approved municipal hunters\u2019 associations ( Associations communales de chasse agr\u00e9\u00e9es \u2013 \u201c ACCAs \u201d ) and approved inter - municipality hunters\u2019 associations ( Associations inter - communales de chasse agr\u00e9\u00e9es \u2013 \u201c AICAs \u201d ) . Section CARDINAL ( which subsequently became Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) states that their object is \u201c to encourage , on their hunting grounds , an increase in game stocks , the destruction of vermin and the prevention of poaching , to instruct their members in how to hunt without interfering with property rights or crops and in general to improve the technical organisation of hunting so that the sport can be practised in a more satisfactory manner \u201d . To that end , the law requires the owners of landholdings smaller in area than a certain threshold , which varies from CARDINAL d\u00e9partement to another , to become members of any ORG set up in their municipality and to transfer to it the hunting rights over their land in order to create municipal hunting grounds .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON applies in d\u00e9partements of metropolitan GPE other than ORG , ORG and GPE , where there is a special regime inherited from NORP law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The creation of an ORG is compulsory in d\u00e9partements on a list drawn up by the Minister responsible for hunting , which designates CARDINAL of the CARDINAL metropolitan d\u00e9partements concerned , including ORG , where Mr PERSON , Mr A. Galland , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON live ( see paragraph DATE below ) and PERSON , where PERSON lives ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the municipalities of the remainder of these CARDINAL d\u00e9partements ACCAs may be set up by the prefect on an application by anyone who can furnish evidence that PERCENT of landowners holding PERCENT of the land in the municipality agree . On DATE were thus set up in CARDINAL municipalities in CARDINAL different d\u00e9partements , including CARDINAL of the CARDINAL municipalities in GPE , where PERSON , PERSON and PERSON live ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The right to hunt belongs to the owner on his land ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , but the creation of an ORG results in the pooling of hunting grounds within the municipality , so that the members of the association can hunt throughout the area thus formed ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . Under certain conditions the owners of landholdings attaining in a single block a specified minimum area ( CARDINAL hectares in GPE and QUANTITY in GPE and GPE ) may object to inclusion of their land in the ORG \u2019s hunting grounds or request its removal from them ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were born in DATE and DATE respectively . All CARDINAL are farmers and live in the d\u00e9partement of GPE , PERSON at ORG and the other CARDINAL at ORG .", "They own landholdings there smaller than QUANTITY in a single block which are included in the hunting grounds of the ACCAs of ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , as members of ORG ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) , and later of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , an approved association of recognised public usefulness with regard to the protection of nature , the applicants placed notices at the boundaries of their property bearing the words \u201c Hunting prohibited \u201d and \u201c Sanctuary \u201d . The ACCAs of ORG and Chourgnac - d\u2019Ans then applied for an injunction requiring the removal of these notices . The judge competent to hear urgent applications granted the injunction sought by a decision of CARDINAL DATE , which was upheld on DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prefect of GPE rejected an application from PERSON , PERSON and PERSON for the removal of their land from the hunting grounds of the ORG and ORG .", "They then applied for judicial review of that decision to ORG , which found against them in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants had brought civil proceedings against the ACCAs of ORG and ORG in the ORG tribunal de grande instance .", "Essentially , they argued that sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Loi Verdeille were incompatible with Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention and LAW No . CARDINAL , firstly in that they provided that all unenclosed plots of land smaller than QUANTITY hectares in area and situated QUANTITY from any dwelling were to be included in an ORG \u2019s hunting grounds by means of the transfer of hunting rights to the association from the landowners or holders of the rights , such transfer being deemed to have been effected automatically and without valuable consideration even without the latter \u2019s consent , and secondly in that a non - hunting landowner automatically became a member of the association . They asked the court to rule on that account that they were third parties in relation to the ACCAs concerned , that their land could no longer be included in the PERSON hunting grounds and that the ACCAs could not rely on the transfer of their hunting rights . Lastly , they asked the court to declare that they had the right to put up on their property notices enjoining respect for their rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG tribunal de grande instance gave judgment in the following terms :", "\u201c [ As regards the argument concerning LAW No . CARDINAL : ]", "Admittedly , the PERSON entails enforced deprivation of the right to hunt , which is one of the elements of the right of property , and obliges the owners of land subject to the PERSON control to accept the presence on the land of third parties , namely hunters .", "Moreover , the PERSON appears to lay down special rules derogating from the principle laid down in LAW that \u2018 No one shall have the right to hunt on land belonging to another without the owner \u2019s consent ... \u2019 .", "...", "[ Protocol No . CARDINAL ] does not exclude restrictions on the right of property ... since LAW , after stating the principle \u2018 No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law\u2019 , goes on to say : \u2018 The preceding provisions shall not , however , in any way impair the right of a ORG to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u2019", "Most of the terms employed reflect the very broad nature of the restrictions which may be imposed on the right of property by signatory GPE in their domestic legislation .", "The Loi Verdeille , whose stated aim ... is to encourage , inter alia , an increase in game stocks , the destruction of vermin and the prevention of poaching , satisfies the \u2018 general interest\u2019 criterion laid down in LAW No . CARDINAL ] . Similarly , in attempting to \u2018 improve the technical organisation of ORG intended to permit democratic participation in hunting and to prevent landowners from reserving exclusive hunting rights over their land , thus restricting the right to use property , meaning in this case the right to hunt , in accordance with the \u2018 general interest\u2019 referred to in [ Protocol No . CARDINAL ] .", "Consequently , with regard to the right of property , the provisions of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the [ PERSON ] do not appear to be contrary to the Convention ...", "[ As regards the arguments concerning LAW , DATE , DATE and DATE of the Convention : ]", "By providing that owners of landholdings of QUANTITY in area shall ipso facto be members of an ORG , section CARDINAL of the Loi Verdeille imposes what amounts to compulsory membership of an association whose aims , as in the present case , are not , for reasons of personal ethics , shared by the members , and indeed are vehemently opposed by them .", "Freedom of association must necessarily be interpreted as the \u2018 positive freedom\u2019 for each individual to join an association of his or her choice , but it also means the negative right not to be compelled to join an association or trade union . To accept that LAW of [ the LAW ] guarantees only the \u2018 NORP freedom of association would mean denying the very principle of that freedom , which is based on the free , voluntary choice of any person who wishes to join a group .", "Accordingly , by compelling certain landowners to join an ORG , sections CARDINAL of the Loi Verdeille violate the very substance of freedom of association , which must be regarded as CARDINAL aspect of the freedom of conscience , opinion and expression which is likewise guaranteed by [ the Convention ] , and lead not to a restriction of the freedom of association but to the negation of it .", "This infringement of the freedom of association appears all the more shocking because the right to object to the transfer of hunting rights is reserved by LAW [ FAC ] exclusively to the owners of properties exceeding QUANTITY in area in a single block .", "Thus the PERSON establishes discrimination between landowners on the basis of the amount of land they own , which is wholly incompatible with LAW ] , whereas the right not to join an ORG should be uniformly granted to all landowners , whatever the size of their holdings .", "Nevertheless , it must be determined whether the interference with exercise of the freedom of association resulting from sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Loi Verdeille can be justified under paragraph CARDINAL of LAW of [ the LAW ] .", "As it is necessarily out of the question to regard the Loi Verdeille as \u2018 necessary in a democratic society\u2019 in the interests of national security or public safety , for the prevention of disorder or crime , or for the protection of health or morals , it can be considered compatible with [ the Convention ] only if it is accepted that the interference with exercise of the freedom of association is justified \u2018 for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\u2019 , the only restriction in the present case provided for by the above - mentioned LAW .", "It must therefore be determined whether the Loi Verdeille governing the organisation of ACCAs , whose object is \u2018 in DATE or mainly , in the GPE submission \u2013 \u2018 to improve the technical organisation of hunting so that the sport can be practised in a more satisfactory manner\u2019 , can prevail over the right not to join a hunters\u2019 association .", "It must be noted in the first place that FAC does not appear to be absolutely necessary , given that it is applied in full in only CARDINAL NORP d\u00e9partements out of CARDINAL , that it affects only CARDINAL municipalities in GPE , including CARDINAL in GPE and that it is not the only legislation concerning the protection of game and compensation for damage caused by it .", "Secondly , the right to hunt is not considered one of the rights protected by [ the Convention ] ( see , to that effect , PERSON . PERSON . PERSON . DATE , page CARDINAL) .", "Consequently , mere protection of the exercise of a sport can not prevail over the fundamental freedom to join or not to join an association . By compelling landowners to become members of ACCAs despite the ethical stance and personal conscience of those members , as in the present case , the Loi Verdeille inflicts on the persons concerned wrongs that are disproportionate to the aim pursued , namely the self - seeking pursuit of a leisure activity and the organisation of that activity .", "ORG therefore finds that sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the [ PERSON ] do not comply with the binding provisions of LAW , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of [ the Convention ] .", "Consequently , the plaintiffs are now entitled to resign their membership of the ACCAs concerned and put up notices on their property bearing the text of their choice , in so far as this is consistent with public - order considerations and accepted moral standards . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG and ORG appealed to ORG .", "On DATE that court set aside all the provisions of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , giving the following reasons :", "\u201c It is certain that in seeking to promote the rational exercise of the right to hunt through the pooling of individual rights over properties smaller than the minimum areas laid down in regulations the [ PERSON ] derogates to a considerable extent from the principle laid down by the provisions of LAW that \u2018 No one shall have the right to hunt on land belonging to another without the consent of the owner or any person entitled through or under the owner\u2019 . By that means , however , the right to hunt , which is CARDINAL element of the right of property , has been detached therefrom in order to ensure that it is exercised in accordance with the general interest , as defined in section CARDINAL , which provides that the object of [ ACCAs ] , thus vested with public - authority prerogatives , shall be \u2018 to encourage , on their hunting grounds , an increase in game stocks , the destruction of vermin and the prevention of poaching , to instruct their members in how to hunt without interfering with property rights or crops and in general to improve the technical organisation of hunting so that the sport can be practised in a more satisfactory manner\u2019 .", "In asserting that ORG only took into consideration \u2018 the self - seeking pursuit of a leisure activity\u2019 , and that this did not justify depriving some people of their fundamental rights , the court below evidently disregarded the object of the provisions referred to above , which concern both protection of the environment and wildlife against unregulated hunting , damage of all kinds or anarchic management and the organisation and regulation of the sport itself . Hunting , on account of the very large number of people who take part in it and its corresponding economic importance , must be subject , like any other popular leisure activity , to the constraints inherent in the normal operation of a public service which has in addition been recognised as such by ORG and the ORG d\u2019Etat ( CE CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u2013 CE CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . As such public - interest restrictions on exercise of the right of property are expressly provided for by [ the Convention ] in LAW No . CARDINAL , the respondents ORG GPE and ORG may not validly plead a breach of that provision . Similarly , the pooling of small properties to form hunting grounds of sufficient size , which are accordingly capable of affording as many people as possible access to leisure activities which would otherwise inevitably remain the prerogative of landowners fortunate enough to possess a large estate , deprives of all foundation the complaint that the [ PERSON ] discriminates on the ground of property , in breach of LAW ] .", "Lastly , while transfer of rights over their land to an ORG gives the landowners concerned the status of automatic members , who are thus empowered to participate in the management of the municipal hunting grounds and to defend their interests , these are the only effects of the provisions in issue . Unlike persons whose membership is conditional , inter alia , on the payment of subscriptions , automatic members are under no obligation . Still less is there any provision for coercive measures or penalties against them ; they are free to hunt or not to hunt , to scrutinise the way the ORG conducts its business and participate in its work or refrain from any involvement in it .", "Whereas , moreover , the creation of ACCAs , and their scope , modus operandi and constitution are not only governed by legislation but also subject to prefectoral approval , and whereas on that account , and notwithstanding the associative form of these bodies , their public - interest role excludes any contractual relationship between their members , the automatic admission , free of charge , of landowners required to transfer their rights is only consideration for the partial alienation that they suffer , and constitutes in addition an undoubted attenuation of the measures restricting the right of property .", "It would appear that the members of the GPE , who are well aware that the general interest imposes certain restrictions on exercise of the right of property and that the [ FAC ] does not in any way erect obstacles to freedom of association , are in fact claiming a right not to hunt , which is neither secured by domestic law nor guaranteed , any more than the right to hunt itself , by international treaties .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicants , giving the following reasons :", "\u201c The provisions of LAW No . CARDINAL ... recognise the right of a ORG to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest , and ORG held , firstly , that the provisions of the [ FAC ] had to do with protection of the environment and wildlife from unregulated hunting and damage of all kinds or anarchic management as much as with the organisation and regulation of hunting itself , and secondly that the pooling of small landholdings into hunting grounds of sufficient size , which would accordingly be able to afford as many people as possible access to leisure activities that would otherwise be bound to remain the prerogative of large landowners , deprived of all foundation the complaint of discrimination based on property . The argument on that point is therefore unfounded .", "...", "Having noted that landowners who had transferred their rights to the association , who were automatic members , were under no obligation , that there was no provision for coercive measures or penalties against them , that these members could participate in the work of the association or refrain from doing so and that , as the public - service role of the association excluded any contractual relationship between its members , the automatic admission , free of charge , of landowners required by law to transfer their rights was only consideration for that transfer , ORG , through those reasons alone provided the reasoning required by law for its decision on that subject . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The mere fact that an ORG has been set up does not impose on them in that respect any constraint , obligation or prohibition ... The freedom of opinion and expression of persons opposed to hunting is necessarily limited by protection of the rights and freedoms of hunters and those who share their convictions .", "As regards the complaint of an interference with the freedom of association", "...", "Under such provisions citizens can not be obliged to join an association against their will . However , since , under the very terms of the provisions relied on , freedom of association may be subject to restrictions which are deemed necessary on general - interest grounds , a citizen may be legally required to join an association whose object is to serve the general interest .

Although it lays down a minimum qualifying area for objections and withdrawals , the PERSON \u2019s wording and its drafting history show that these limits were laid down in order to ensure the rational organisation of hunting . Such a general interest justifies a difference in treatment between landowners depending on the area of land they possess without this different treatment constituting a breach of equality before the law .", "As regards the complaint of an infringement of the right of property and the right of use", "...", "Although the provisions cited above protect the right of property and the right to use one \u2019s possessions , they do not prevent restrictions being imposed thereon in the general interest .

The landowners whose land is included in the ORG \u2019s hunting grounds receive consideration for the loss of their exclusive right of use in the form of their membership of the ORG and the services it provides . The fact that [ the applicants ] stated that they were not interested by such forms of consideration is not capable of rendering them insufficient . Lastly , although [ the applicants ] maintained that LAW DATE did not ensure fair and prior compensation , contrary to provisions having the status of constitutional law , it is not for the administrative courts to rule on the constitutionality of legislation .
