ORG are State - funded religious schools .", "The applicants explained that , with certain exceptions , on enrolling at ORG the pupils concerned had produced identity photographs that showed them wearing the headscarf . The pupils had always worn the NORP headscarf to school , in accordance with both their own and their parents ' religious beliefs . As a general rule , they had started to wear the NORP headscarf at the onset of puberty at the age of CARDINAL .", "However , from DATE pupils wearing the headscarf had been refused access to the schools . Pupils attending school in the headscarf had been seen by the school educational psychologist , who had attempted to justify the need for the rules . These measures were based on a directive which ORG had issued to the district education officers on DATE . The relevant sections of the directive provided :", "\u201c Pupils are enrolled at ORG only once a document signed by the parents has been lodged confirming that the pupils will comply with the rules on dress . In addition , a letter was sent on DATE requesting compliance with this practice .", "However , we have been informed that a small number of pupils do not comply with the rules on dress .", "Their persistent failure to comply with the rules shows that they are not acting innocently . Their decision to wear the headscarf at school thus amounts to a rejection of the rules on dress and a protest against the education system .", "That being so , disciplinary proceedings will be taken against head teachers or members of the teaching staff who fail to ensure rigorous compliance with the rules on dress ... Furthermore , all sporting , cultural and social activities that are liable to cause tension at school and unsettle the pupils must cease and links between the schools and associations , foundations and boarding schools [ promoting such practices ] must be severed .", "In the light of this , you are requested to take all necessary measures to reintegrate these pupils into our education system , to refuse pupils who do not obey the rules on dress access to school LOC and to institute disciplinary proceedings against them without delay under LAW in Secondary Schools dependent on ORG [ ORG Orta\u00f6\u011fretim Kurumlar\u0131 \u00d6d\u00fcl ve PERSON \u2013 ' the disciplinary rules ' ] .

The relevant sections of the memorandum stated :", "\u201c The \u0130mam - Hatip Secondary Schools are vocational secondary schools that are part of our ORG education system ...", "It would appear that some girls in these schools do not comply with the rules on dress . Their acts are concerted and conscious and the girls are supported by certain groups outside the school which are exploiting this issue . [ Consequently , ] it is clear that these girls are , under the political and ideological influence of groups both inside and outside the school , putting pressure on head teachers , members of the teaching staff and pupils who do not share their views . [ It is further established that , ] although they attend school , neither they , nor their supporters among the boys , go to classes .", "On enrolling , all pupils in these schools are informed of the school rules and give a written undertaking to comply with them . However , with the help of their supporters , some pupils have for ideological reasons stated and demonstrated by their conduct a determination to pursue their studies without obeying the rules .", "Rule DATE . of the Rules on Dress for Staff and Pupils in GPE dependent on ORG and ORG ( no .

ORG dismissed an appeal brought by a parent whose daughter , a pupil at an ORG , was required to remove her headscarf under the disciplinary rules published in ORG of DATE . It found that ' such behaviour at school is the symbol of a vision that is contrary to the fundamental principles of the Republic ' .", "Accordingly , it is necessary to ensure continuity within the education system and to make schools accessible to everyone by establishing a calm environment at school and harmonising practice when applying the rules to pupils who do not obey the rules on dress or wish to pursue their studies ... \u201d", "The memorandum characterised the failure to comply with the rules on dress as a concerted attack on the fundamental principles of the Republic and gave the head teachers CARDINAL instructions on how to deal with breaches . In the first instance , pupils were to be informed of the relevant rules , which were to be applied strictly . In the event of repeated transgressions , the pupil was to be given an immediate warning and disciplinary proceedings were to be commenced . The head teachers were also requested to prevent those who supported such misconduct for political and ideological ends from meeting within the vicinity of the school .", "The applicants produced to the ORG eleven documents signed by a group of people ( pupils , parents and third parties ) who had gathered outside FAC and PERSON attesting that on DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE , the head teachers , accompanied by members of the security forces , had prevented pupils wearing the headscarf from entering the schools .", "At TIME on DATE a meeting was organised outside ORG . According to a report by the security forces , CARDINAL PERSON , who claimed to be a member of ORG ( an association formed by former pupils of ORG ) , was arrested on suspicion of provocation . The report also stated that CARDINAL headscarf - wearing pupils had demonstrated outside the school shouting slogans such as \u201c If you are in [ the school ] , come on out \u201d , \u201c ORG ! Do not sleep ! Defend your pupils \u201d , \u201c ORG , do not sleep ! Your turn will come \u201d . After warnings by the security forces , CARDINAL pupils were taken to the police station at TIME that same day for identity checks .

He was accused of inciting pupils to disobey the rules on dress . He was released at TIME , after the police had taken a statement .", "On DATE one of the applicants , PERSON , lodged a request with ORG for a declaration that the head teachers of ORG had prevented her from wearing her headscarf to school as her religious beliefs required . ORG decided DATE that it had no jurisdiction to hear the request .", "A further request to the same end was rejected by ORG on DATE . It found that there was no reason to make any declaration since the act complained of was lawful .", "In the meantime the applicants lodged a criminal complaint against the head teachers of ORG and the police . They alleged that denying pupils wearing the headscarf access to school violated their fundamental right to education and was therefore a criminal offence .", "The applicants have produced to the ORG a decision dated DATE in which the public prosecutor at ORG declared a complaint against ORG unfounded after deciding that his actions complied with the rules on dress .", "The applicants have also produced an opinion issued by ORG attached to ORG Office on DATE after CARDINAL petitions were lodged .", "Citing the principle of secularism enunciated in LAW and the risk that the principle of neutrality in ORG education would be undermined , arguments that had already been expounded at length by ORG in a judgment of DATE , ORG concluded that the rules on dress were consistent with the LAW and human rights . It noted that the ORG was required by LAW to take measures to uphold fundamental rights such as freedom of religion and the right to education , and stated that the existence of the ORG schools showed that the ORG had taken concrete measures to secure those rights . It further pointed out that , by its very nature , the right to education required ORG regulation .", "In that connection , ORG noted that the main reason the rules on pupils ' dress had been introduced was to protect the principle of secularism and added that the country 's highest courts had on a number of occasions ruled that the rules were consistent with constitutional principles . Furthermore , the pupils who had not complied with the rules on dress had been informed of the reasons for the rules on enrolling at the school and had given a written undertaking to comply with them . However , the pupils concerned and those who supported them for ideological reasons had shown that they did not intend to abide by the rules . ORG concluded that such conduct was not protected in a ORG committed to the rule of law .", "At the same time , on DATE a parliamentary commission which had been set up to look into the events that had taken place in ORG in GPE in DATE adopted its opinion . It noted in particular that the forcible removal of certain pupils by the security forces had caused social unrest . Consequently , it advised against any further use of force . It also noted that the events had occurred as a result of the rules on dress for which ORG and the executive were responsible .", "Article CARDINAL , in its relevant parts , provides as follows :", "\u201c Everyone shall have the right to freedom of conscience and religious conviction .", "...", "No one shall be compelled to participate in prayers , worship or religious services or to reveal his or her religious beliefs and convictions ; no one shall be censured or prosecuted for his religious beliefs or convictions .", "Education and instruction in religion and ethics shall be provided under the supervision and control of ORG Instruction in religious culture and in morals shall be a compulsory part of the curricula of primary and secondary schools .

It stated that the principle of secularism intrinsically encompassed religious neutrality and precluded the grant of privileges to individual religions . It considered the headscarf to have obvious religious connotations . In GPE , where the majority of the population were NORP , presenting the wearing of the NORP headscarf as a mandatory religious duty would result in discrimination between practising NORP , non - practising NORP and non - believers on grounds of dress , with anyone who refused to wear the headscarf undoubtedly being regarded as opposed to religion or as non - religious . Accordingly , allowing the headscarf to be worn would be liable to undermine order both inside and outside the university ( for a more detailed summary of ORG judgment , see PERSON v.

The remainder of the curriculum is taken up by general subjects . According to information furnished by the applicants , in DATE there were CARDINAL \u0130mam - Hatip Secondary Schools in GPE attended by CARDINAL pupils . Once they have completed their secondary - school education , pupils may enrol at the theology faculties after sitting a general examination . Parents send their children to these schools not just to enable them to become future religious functionaries but also to allow them to pursue advanced studies in general subjects while at the same time receiving a sound religious grounding . Many practising families who are dissatisfied with the limited time and facilities devoted to religious studies in the general education system have philosophical affinities with the curriculum offered by the vocational schools for religious functionaries . A section of the population has thus deflected these schools from their original purpose DATE which was to train modern , professional clerics \u2013 and has gradually turned them into general secondary - education schools with a religious vocation ( for more detailed information , see \u201c Teaching of religion and morals in the NORP education system \u201d , PERSON and GPE , ORG in LOC , www.flwi.ugent.be ) .", "Furthermore , a form of religious instruction has been organised in most parts of GPE in the form of courses on the Koran ( PERSON ) .
