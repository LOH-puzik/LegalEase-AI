SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in Link\u00f6ping . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE and applied for asylum .", "At an initial interview conducted by ORG ( Migrationsverket ) on DATE , the applicant stated , inter alia , that she had been born in GPE , in the south - west of GPE , and had gone to school and always lived in GPE in that state . She belonged to the ethnic group GPE and was a NORP . She submitted a certificate of registration of birth dated DATE and a copy of an article published in the newspaper ORG DATE . The article , entitled \u201c A Pregnant Teenager NORP Girl Elopes To LOC ? \u201d , stated the following :", "\u201c A young DATE , PERSON of ORG in the LOC part of GPE is reported to be on the run , having fled from DATE , PERSON whom she was engaged to . Feeling that she did not like the man she was betrothed to , young PERSON is alleged to have become pregnant by her younger lover , a discovery that she has not found to be comfortable with in her ORG .", "By the LAW laws , being pregnant by another man while being engaged is regarded as adulterous and the penalty would mean condemnation to death . The matter has been reported to the head of her village in GPE - Ala and the NORP clerics have declared PERSON wanted . A search to the hometown of her lover in GPE , in the NORP part of the country has proved abortive so far since the event came to light some DATE .", "Fears are expressed that Miss PERSON may have eloped outside the country with her lover but that can not be confirmed as at the time of filing this report . \u201d", "Below the article was a picture allegedly depicting the applicant .", "At the interview , the applicant stated that she had last been in contact with her boyfriend \u201c ... when [ she ] had this problem , in DATE . In DATE and DATE [ she ] was still in contact with him , but now [ she ] no longer had any contact with him . ... [ She ] saw him last in DATE \u201d . She further stated that she had not wanted to get married to the DATE man suggested by her father , and she had told her father that she already had a boyfriend . She was however married against her will . After a while she discovered that she was pregnant . She told her father who got very angry . Later , her father showed her the newspaper article and told her that she had to escape to save her life . Her boyfriend had contacted and paid a business woman who had helped her to leave GPE .", "A second interview was held with the applicant on DATE . The applicant then stated that she lived in GPE in ORG , in central GPE . She had been married for DATE . When her husband had learned about her pregnancy he had beaten her severely , after which she had left to stay with her aunt . She was at her aunt \u2019s for DATE until her aunt arranged for her journey to GPE . She had seen in the newspaper that she was wanted by the village chief and that she was to be stoned to death . She did not know exactly how long she had been pregnant but she believed that it had been DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application for asylum . It remarked that , according to the newspaper article submitted by the applicant , the incidents had taken place in DATE , whereas the applicant had stated that she got married in DATE and that the incidents leading to her leaving the country had occurred DATE after the marriage . The ORG found that , irrespective of the truthfulness of her story , the applicant had not made a sufficiently probable case that she would not receive any protection or help from the NORP authorities . Protection from criminal actions and assault was a matter for the domestic authorities , and it appeared that the applicant had not reported the incidents to the police . ORG concluded that the applicant had not been able to show that , upon return to GPE , she would be treated in a manner which would entitle her to refugee status or protection . It further concluded that , having regard to the very restrictive practice concerning the grant of a residence permit on humanitarian grounds , the facts in the instant case were not sufficient to warrant such a permit .", "On DATE the applicant gave birth to a son .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nnings - n\u00e4mnden ) . ORG also referred to ORG the applicant \u2019s request for a residence permit concerning her son .", "In the appeal , the applicant \u2019s representative stated that the applicant had been beaten by her husband when he found out about her infidelity and , on DATE , she had escaped to her aunt \u2019s home . According to the representative , the applicant had been sentenced to death by the council in her husband \u2019s village . In a subsequent letter to ORG , the representative stated , in relation to the comments of ORG regarding the dates mentioned in the article and those given by the applicant herself , that the applicant was a very young , inexperienced girl who had a great respect for authority and had not been fully aware of the length of a pregnancy . However , she was certain that she had been married in DATE and had become pregnant in DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and the application concerning her son . It concluded that the applicant \u2019s identity was unclear and that the time frames given by her were not compatible with the information in the NORP newspaper article . The time indicated for the \u201c event \u201d in the article was also inaccurate in relation to the time of birth of her baby . Due to the above , and considering the applicant \u2019s case as a whole , ORG found that she had not shown that she was to be regarded as a refugee or as a person otherwise in need of protection . Nor did it find any humanitarian grounds to warrant a residence permit ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
