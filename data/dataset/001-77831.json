The first applicant is the owner of the DATE newspaper \u201c der Standard \u201d , the second applicant was at the material time the chief editor of its internal politics section .", "CARDINAL . In the issue of \u201c der Standard \u201d of CARDINAL DATE the second applicant published an article about ORG ( ORG , \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in its regular section \u201c commentary \u201d . So far as material , it read as follows :", "\u201c PERSON of the decent", "The ORG is becoming ever truer to itself and many people are developing an increasingly similar image of it . For any organisation , whether a movement , party or whatever , is moulded by those at the top \u2013 how they interact with one another , which people they choose , how they cope with crises . All of this rubs off and has its effects . In the case of the ORG leader PERSON this means : people are useful idiots , you can entice them with fine words , appeal to their nobler principles and , indeed , use them as long as they are of service to your own interests .", "Dealings within the ORG are correspondingly cunning . PERSON has never even been soft towards his closest friends and backers and has dropped them as soon as they no longer fitted in with his plans . PERSON , PERSON and PERSON are all examples . Others , such as PERSON or PERSON , are allowed all kinds of liberties because they know too much . They have not been damaged either by convictions for tax evasion or by any other slip - ups .", "The MP PERSON was not excluded from the ORG on that account and was not scorned by his former colleagues because proceedings had been instituted against him for fraud . That is of little consequence to PERSON , especially as he would otherwise have to bar himself from the ORG . After all , PERSON was convicted in criminal proceedings at first instance because he had ruined a person \u2019s good reputation and prospects for the future . A conviction , in any event , is of a different order from the institution of proceedings . ORG was in fact dropped because in the PERSON case PERSON needs as many sacrificial victims as possible , to show to the public as and when required . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The article alluded to Mr PERSON \u2019s conviction of DATE by ORG , which had found him guilty of attempted defamation of a university professor , NORP , in that he and his then lawyer PERSON , who had at the material time become Minister of ORG , had prepared a video - taped statement for the purpose of having it broadcast by ORG which contained defamatory statements about NORP The broadcast had been refused , after a number of TV journalists and other staff of ORG had seen the video - tape .", "CARDINAL . This background was not mentioned in the above article but \u201c der Standard \u201d had reported on Mr PERSON \u2019s conviction in its issue of CARDINAL DATE . It read as follows :", "\u201c Criminal court convicts PERSON also convicted of defamation", "The ORG federal party leader , PERSON , and his lawyer , PERSON , were convicted of attempted defamation on DATE and fined MONEY and CARDINAL schillings respectively . The convictions relate to their ongoing DATE legal dispute with NORP [ full name ] , an GPE - based expert in financial law , who was thwarted in his bid to become President of ORG when PERSON embroiled him in a motorway - building scandal . Mr PERSON had repeatedly been asked to withdraw his allegations in the course of civil proceedings over DATE . Since no such action was taken , he and his lawyer have now been convicted at first instance by a criminal court . Both have appealed .", "In DATE Mr PERSON blocked Mr D. \u2019s candidacy for the post of President of ORG by accusing him of having been involved in a major scandal of the time concerning the building of the GPE motorway . Mr NORP lodged a complaint and obtained an order from ORG requiring PERSON to withdraw his accusations in a television broadcast . But according to DATE \u2019s judgment , the videotape prepared for that purpose once again contained defamatory accusations . As the tape was not broadcast , however , the court ruled that the offence should be classified merely as attempted defamation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON brought CARDINAL sets of proceedings against the applicants as regards the statement \u201c After all , PERSON was convicted in criminal proceedings at first instance because he had ruined a person \u2019s good reputation and prospects for the future \u201d contained in the issue of \u201c der Standard \u201d of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON brought private prosecution proceedings for defamation under LAW ( Mediengesetz ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants made submissions to the St. ORG ( PERSON ) drawing its attention to ORG judgment of DATE in the preliminary injunction proceedings ( see paragraphs DATE ) , which had found that PERSON PERSON \u2019s interest in the protection of his reputation was outweighed by the public interest in receiving the information at issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ordered the applicant company to pay compensation of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) to Mr PERSON and to publish the judgment .", "CARDINAL . Referring to Section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG found that the statement at issue fulfilled the elements of defamation ( \u00fcble GPE ) under LAW . Having regard to the judgment against Mr PERSON of DATE , the applicant company had failed to prove the truth of its statement that Mr PERSON had ruined D. \u2019s good reputation and his prospects for the future . Although the distinction between an attempted and a completed offence was , as a general rule , not relevant for proving the truth of a statement concerning a person \u2019s conviction , the applicant had claimed that the defamation committed by PERSON PERSON had had the effect of ruining D. \u2019s good reputation and his prospects for the future . However , as Mr PERSON had only been convicted of attempted defamation , NORP had not suffered any actual damage and the judgment did not establish any causal link between Mr PERSON \u2019s offence and the alleged negative consequences for D.", "CARDINAL . ORG acquitted the second applicant of the charge of defamation under LAW , finding that she had been present in court on DATE , when the judgment against Mr PERSON had been read out and had gained the impression that he had ruined D. \u2019s good reputation and future perspectives . Consequently , she had not acted with criminal intent .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company and Mr PERSON appealed . The applicant company contested in particular ORG view that it had failed to establish the truth of its allegation . It argued that the distinction between a conviction for the completed offence and a conviction for the attempted offence was contrary to established case - law under LAW . Further , it complained that ORG had failed to deal with its requests for the taking of evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal . Upon Mr PERSON \u2019s appeal , it convicted the second applicant of defamation und ordered her to pay a fine of ORG CARDINAL ( CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment in default ) suspended on probation .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view the second applicant , being an experienced journalist must have known the impression which her statement made on the reader . She had claimed to have acted in good faith , however under LAW , the defence of good faith was not available where the defamatory statement at issue had been published in the media . The court repeated that the truth of the impugned statement had not been established . The second applicant had inappropriately linked Mr PERSON \u2019s conviction with events relating to NORP \u2019s candidature for President of ORG dating DATE back .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the appellate court noted that ORG , without giving reasons , had dismissed the applicant \u2019s requests for taking of evidence , namely to hear professor NORP and a number of staff members of ORG as witnesses in order to show that NORP \u2019s reputation had been ruined , as the latter had actually seen the video tape containing defamatory statements about him . The appellate ORG found , firstly , that the requests at issue were irrelevant , as the article had not claimed that NORP \u2019s reputation and perspectives for the future had been ruined with regard to staff members of ORG . Secondly , it noted that the applicants had not repeated their request in due form after the hearing before ORG had been postponed once .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was served on the applicants\u2019 counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON filed an action under CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG ) and a request for a preliminary injunction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a preliminary injunction ordering the applicants to refrain from stating that Mr PERSON had been convicted since he had ruined a person \u2019s good reputation and perspectives for the future .", "CARDINAL . ORG had regard to the content of the article as a whole and considered that , against this background , the reference to Mr PERSON \u2019s conviction was not aimed at informing about the judgment against him , but was used to criticise his character . The main thrust of the article was not a political criticism of the ORG and its leadership but an attack on Mr PERSON with the aim of disparaging him . Thus , the court concluded that the boundaries of acceptable criticism had been transgressed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and dismissed PERSON request for a preliminary injunction .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the judgment of CARDINAL DATE against Mr PERSON , the court found that the incriminated sentence contained a true statement of facts . The offence of defamation was defined as accusing another of behaviour such as to make him contemptible and lower him in public esteem . It could therefore be equated with ruining a person \u2019s good reputation and perspectives for the future , in particular in a case like the present one where NORP had been a candidate for a public office . The dissemination of true statements of fact could only violate the interests of the person concerned if there was no prevailing public interest in receiving the information . However , information about the personal credibility of a politician , demonstrated by his conviction for defamation , was in the public interest , in particular in pre - election times when the general public gathered information about the different parties and their representatives .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected Mr PERSON \u2019s extraordinary appeal on points of law , finding that it did not raise an important legal issue .", "CARDINAL . In the main proceedings the St. P\u00f6lten Regional Court gave judgment on DATE , ordering the applicants to refrain from the statement at issue , to withdraw it and to publish its judgment .", "CARDINAL . It observed that the notion of defamation in LAW had to be construed in the light of the criteria established by criminal law . The civil courts were not formally bound by a judgment of the criminal courts . However , it was ORG established case - law that a person convicted of a criminal offence could not argue in any subsequent proceedings that he had not committed that offence . ORG therefore considered itself bound by ORG final judgment of DATE in the proceedings under LAW ( see paragraphs LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal .", "CARDINAL . It confirmed the first instance court \u2019s view as regards the binding effect of the ORG conviction under LAW of LAW and added that the weighing of interests between the protection of Mr PERSON \u2019s good reputation on the one hand and the public interest in receiving the information was inherent in the conviction and could not be assessed anew in the civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG extraordinary appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation ; the victim can thus claim damages from him . In this context \u201c defamation \u201d has been defined in LAW ) , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Anybody who , in such a way that it may be noticed by a third person , attributes to another a contemptible characteristic or sentiment or accuses him of behaviour contrary to honour or morality and such as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding DATE or a fine ...", "CARDINAL . Anyone who commits this offence in a printed document , by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public , shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine ...", "CARDINAL . NORP The person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true . In the case of the offence defined in paragraph CARDINAL he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to believe that the statement was true . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG ) provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Anybody who , due to defamation , suffered a damage or loss of profit , may claim for compensation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The same applies if anyone is disseminating facts , which jeopardize another person \u2019s reputation , gain or livelihood , the untruth of which was known or must have been known to him . In this case there is also a right to claim a revocation and the publication thereof ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . It is ORG constant case - law that a person who has been convicted in criminal proceedings can not argue in subsequent civil proceedings that he has not committed the offence at issue ( lead - case CARDINAL Ob CARDINAL , DATE , ORG ) .
