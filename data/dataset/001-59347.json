On DATE , in TIME , an accident took place in ORG , a small village in the GPE . PERSON was struck by a car and suffered a slight injury to his arm . PERSON reported the incident to the police and identified the type and registration number of the car involved . He had , however , not been in a position to identify the driver of the car .", "CARDINAL . On TIME , officers of the local police station started investigations . They found the car , registered in the name of the applicant \u2019s mother , PERSON , parked in front of the house where the applicant was living with his family . The applicant \u2019s mother stated that she had not been driving . As regards the applicant , she stated that he was not home yet and showed the police officers the applicant \u2019s room in which his bed was untouched . Further , she stated that the car was regularly used by several family members . She was requested to send the applicant to the police station as soon as he came in . When asked DATE , the applicant \u2019s mother stated that he still had not come home . In its investigation report the police referred to the applicant as the suspect and stated that , according to the police ORG general observations , he was the main user of the car .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and on DATE ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) tried the applicant on charges of causing injury by negligence ( fahrl\u00e4ssige GPE ) . The applicant pleaded \u201c not guilty \u201d . He stated that he had not been driving the car at the relevant time and that he did not wish to make any further submissions . PERSON , heard as a witness , confirmed his statements to the police , in particular that he had not been able to identify the driver of the car , nor to state whether the driver had been male or female . The applicant \u2019s mother and his sister exercised their right not to testify . The minutes state that they were cautioned as to this right , but do not mention the ground on which the caution was based . Pursuant to section QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Strafprozessordnung ) , so far as relevant in the present context , a witness may refuse to give evidence if the statement would expose him or her to the danger of criminal prosecution ; a witness may equally refuse to give evidence in proceedings against a close relative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of causing injury by negligence . It sentenced him to a fine of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) , CARDINAL of which was suspended on probation , and ordered him to pay ORG CARDINAL as a partial amount for damages to the victim . In establishing the facts , the court relied on the investigation report of the police , the statement of PERSON and the applicant \u2019s defence . Its reasoning was as follows :", "\u201c The accused stated in his evidence at trial that he had not been driving the vehicle at the time of the accident and denied every other point in the statement of facts . Both the accused \u2019s mother , who is the legal owner of the vehicle , and his sister , [ M.G. ] , whom the accused called as a witness , refused to give evidence at the trial . As the injured party , [ Mr K. ] , could not determine at the time of the accident who had been driving the vehicle , the only evidence which remained in connection with this point were the observations of the Obermieming police station , according to which it was common knowledge that the vehicle in question was mainly driven by the accused , ... On the basis of those observations the court is also satisfied that [ the applicant ] was driving the vehicle at the material time and caused the accident . The additional circumstance that , according to the observations of the Obermieming police station , the accused was not at home after the accident and had evidently still not returned by TIME that day and , moreover , that no one knew where he was , leads to the sole , unequivocal conclusion that only the accused could have committed the offence ; presumably he refused to make a statement because he was under the influence of alcohol , but there is no evidence for that finding . The remaining findings as to the circumstances of the accident or the subsequent course of events are based solely on the consistent and fully credible statements of the witness [ Mr K. ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , after having supplemented the proceedings by inspecting a file concerning administrative criminal proceedings against the applicant \u2019s sister relating to a traffic offence , and having found that the car at issue was also used by the applicant \u2019s sister , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and confirmed the first instance judgment . In particular , as regards ORG evaluation of evidence , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c The impugned assessment of the evidence is consistent , complete and convincing , so that the appellate court can adopt it as well as the findings based thereon . It is the case that the person claiming damages in criminal proceedings was only able to identify the car and could not describe the occupant or occupants of the vehicle . From the evidence it is established , however , that the car , registered in the name of the accused \u2019s mother , is mainly used by the accused , even if it is also occasionally used by others , such as the accused \u2019s sister . It would have been open to the accused to give a contrary version of events which conflicted with the charges and to put in relevant evidence without thereby at the same time having to name another person as the driver . That was evidently impossible , however , because having spent TIME away from his GPE house and possibly consuming alcohol he had on DATE driven his mother \u2019s car through ORG . The court of first instance correctly referred to the observations of the police officers to the effect that immediately after the accident the car was indeed in front of the GPE house , yet the accused \u2019s bed had not been slept in and he could not be found . Nor could it be ascertained where the accused , who refused to make a written statement to the police , was staying . On the basis of the available evidence before it the court of first instance made a realistic assessment of the facts , especially as there was no evidence that anyone else , such as the accused \u2019s sister , had been driving the car at the time of the accident . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
