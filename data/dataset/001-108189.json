Although the applicant consistently denied guilt , both during the pre - trial investigations and the trial , on DATE ORG found him guilty of the violent robbery of PERSON and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment with confiscation of all his personal property .

The court additionally heard a number of defence witnesses who stated that they had either spent DATE on DATE in the applicant \u2019s company or had seen him at various times on that date . The court decided , however , that those statements were either untruthful , because the witnesses were the applicant \u2019s friends and wanted to help him avoid criminal liability , or unrelated to the precise time when the robbery had been committed . PERSON was questioned during the trial and retracted her earlier statements incriminating the applicant as given under duress . However , the court chose to rely on those earlier statements as more plausible and concordant with the other facts . It noted , in particular , that she had not requested a medical examination until DATE after her questioning by the police and that there was no evidence that the injuries discovered had been inflicted on her in police custody . While PERSON contended that she had been hiding in fear that the police might seek revenge , the court considered it more probable that she had in fact been afraid that the applicant \u2019s accomplices who had not been detained might seek revenge .", "CARDINAL .

The investigator [ N. ] demanded that I identify [ T. and PERSON ] . In exchange , he promised I would be acquitted and that criminal department officials would be held liable . I remembered [ T. ] because he had been the Chief , and [ PERSON ] because he had been wearing glasses . I could recognise only those CARDINAL , as I could not , and do not now , remember any other officers . I was beaten up at FAC , no . CARDINAL , as they really needed my confession to the robbery .

At the same time , he promised that if I followed his advice I would be at liberty shortly . It is very difficult for me now to testify before the court , for I have got confused in my statements because it was the investigator [ N. ] who gave them to me .
