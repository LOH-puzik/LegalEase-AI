On DATE permission was granted and the proceedings were issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the subsequent hearing , counsel for the Attorney General accepted that for a juror after a trial to express his own views in a general way about the merits or demerits of the jury system would not be a breach of section CARDINAL . Similarly , the juror would not breach section CARDINAL by expressing general views about jurors relying on expert evidence . He identified the disclosures in the articles which he alleged infringed section CARDINAL as :", "\u201c ... the consensus was taken TIME after the foreman was voted in .

Counsel for the second applicant , supported by counsel for the first applicant , referred to LAW and to the right and duty of the press , in the interests of the administration of justice , to tell the public what had happened in court proceedings . He argued that a purposive construction of section CARDINAL was required and that involved limiting breaches to disclosures which interfered with the proper administration of justice . Considered in the context of the article as a whole , the first applicant was using his experience of the GPE trial to criticise the way in which cases based on medical opinion evidence were tried . It was not a disclosure of confidential information but of information about how the system worked , much of it favourable to the system . Fears were expressed about reliance on expert medical evidence and the expression of such concerns was legitimate . The ORG counsel accordingly argued that the order sought by the Attorney General would amount to a violation of the applicants\u2019 rights under LAW . There was no \u2018 pressing social ORG to curtail the disclosures made and , on the facts of the case , the balance between LAW CARDINAL right and the general community interest came down on the side of freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , delivering the judgment of the court on DATE , found the applicants guilty of contempt of court . He observed that it was not suggested that section CARDINAL was incompatible with LAW , and observed that this ORG had acknowledged the legitimacy of the rule governing the secrecy of jury deliberations in GPE . He therefore declined to read down the words in section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , pursuant to LAW DATE , in order to interpret restrictively the relevant words contained in that section .", "CARDINAL . The judge accepted that the articles were published in a reputable newspaper , following legal advice given in good faith , and that the first applicant was not harassed to provide his views but had approached the newspaper unprompted . He further accepted that the first applicant was genuinely concerned about the use made of medical evidence in criminal trials , which was an issue of public interest . However , he noted :", "\u201c DATE . The words used in section CARDINAL in relation to the \u2018 deliberations\u2019 ; \u2018 statements PERSON , \u2018 opinions PERSON , \u2018 arguments advanced\u2019 , and \u2018 votes PERSON appear to me to cover the entire range of a jury \u2019s deliberations when considering their verdict or verdicts in the case . Provided the disclosure is in relation to their deliberations in the case , and not about an extraneous matter , it comes within the section . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Reiterating the rationale for the need to keep secret the deliberations of the jury as stated in previous cases , he continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The jury system has shown itself to be robust in operation and is valued highly in this jurisdiction . Its strength and value depend on the open and frank expression of views CARDINAL people in the secrecy of the jury room . Confidence to express views in that way depends on the juror \u2019s knowledge that the views will not be revealed outside the jury room . Jurors should not be constrained by fears a juror would legitimately have if his friends and neighbours , and the general public , may come to know of his views , which could be unpopular views . If views were expressed in the hope of their being disclosed , or with an intention to disclose , that would also have a deleterious effect on the quality of deliberations .", "DATE . It is the principle of the secrecy of the jury room which is at stake and which is central to the proper administration of justice in this jurisdiction , as stated in the authorities . It is not necessary to establish that the disclosure has led to injustice in the case concerned . Disclosures must be examined individually if the principle is to be maintained . Disclosures found to be in breach of the section do not obtain cover by being interwoven , whether intentionally or unintentionally interwoven , with expressions of general concern , which may legitimately be made by a juror . They do not obtain cover by the addition of favourable comments about how the jury functioned , as some of the disclosures in this case may have done . Indeed , disclosures incorporating favourable comment about other jurors could constitute a breach . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , he concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In my judgment , the disclosure of the CARDINAL vote was a clear breach of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . It was a breach as disclosing a vote . Moreover , it revealed the opinions expressed by CARDINAL members of the jury , at an early stage of a long deliberation . The reference to \u2018 no going back\u2019 also revealed a firm intention on the part of those CARDINAL members not to change their minds , a revelation of the opinions they held .", "CARDINAL . The paragraph dealing with common sense also constituted a breach . It was disclosed that the majority who convicted used a \u2018 despicable enemy of correct and logical thinking\u2019 . That was the foreman \u2019s assessment of the opinions of and statements expressed by the majority members and he disclosed them by making those comments . The majority members were , in the opinion of the foreman , guilty of incorrect and illogical thinking , an accusation against them , combined with a disclosure of , their opinions .", "CARDINAL . It is disclosed that the majority members used that \u2018 wonderfully persuasive device , common ORG . That is a disclosure of their approach to the evidence , which necessarily was based on statements they had made or opinions they had expressed during the deliberations . If the foreman \u2019s assessment of their opinions was incorrect , it may add to the wrong done to them , but that is not material ; the mischief is in the disclosure of the deliberations . It is not necessary to prove that the accusations made against fellow jurors were true .", "CARDINAL . The assumption is made in the foreman \u2019s disclosure that common sense is the enemy of correct thinking , and therefore of justice . That assumption can of course be questioned ; common sense is generally perceived to be valuable and does not inevitably lead to the acceptance of expert medical evidence . Debate of the merits of common sense is not , however , in point for present purposes . What is relevant is that the disclosures reveal the approach of this jury to the evidence in this case ; reliance on common sense and not correct and logical thinking . Whether or not that is a disclosure offensive to the majority members need not be decided ; it was a disclosure of their approach , as assessed by the foreman , thereby revealing their opinions . It offended against the secrecy of the jury room , as that concept is viewed in the authorities . The foreman should not have disclosed the approach to the evidence of other jurors . What may be legitimate debate in the course of deliberations should not be revealed outside . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the remaining CARDINAL disclosures about which the Attorney General had complained ( see above ) , the judge found that they were general comments on the strength of the evidence for the prosecution and did not breach the DATE Act .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was fined GBP CARDINAL . The second applicant was fined GBP CARDINAL and ordered to pay costs of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG . Leave was refused by the newly instituted ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE three high - profile trials took place concerning the death of children in which expert medical evidence had been critical to the prosecution case . In CARDINAL of the cases , convictions were handed down at first instance . However , the convictions were subsequently overturned and the medical evidence called into question . These cases were referred to in the front page article published in The ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG published a consultation paper on ORG and PERSON , seeking views on whether there should continue to be a ban on all research into a jury \u2019s deliberations .

However , no amendment was made to the DATE Act .", "CARDINAL .

NORP The matter of the death of babies in which the triad of intracranial injuries , considered by most experts to be indicative of non - accidental head injury , or \u201c shaken baby syndrome \u201d , was present was also of topical importance , following the review of CARDINAL convictions by ORG in DATE which resulted in CARDINAL convictions being overturned . ORG explained in its judgment that while the triad pointed strongly to non - accidental head injury it did not automatically and necessarily lead to such a diagnosis .", "CARDINAL . The criminal case at issue in the present applications had itself received considerable publicity . It had been suggested in the press , prior to the publication of the CARDINAL articles by The ORG , that the jury had not been given adequate time to deliberate and that a miscarriage of justice had occurred .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG issued a consultation paper on ORG and GPE . The paper noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL However , the possibility or likelihood of jury deference in relation to complex fields of knowledge gives rise to a danger if there are legitimate questions about the reliability of the expert \u2019s evidence . This may be because the expert \u2019s field of knowledge is a novel or developing science with little in the way of peer review , or because there are doubts as to the validity of the expert \u2019s methodology , hypothesis or assumptions , or for some other reason .", "CARDINAL The problem is particularly worrying if there is no available expert in the same field who can be called by the opposing party to provide an effective criticism of the expert evidence in question , particularly if the forensic tool of cross - examination ( by a non - specialist advocate ) would provide only an ineffectual substitute . The jury in such cases may have no real option but to defer to the view of the expert even though his or her testimony may be insufficiently reliable to warrant such deference or , indeed , any consideration at all .", "CARDINAL A related problem , touched upon in the preceding paragraph , is that the non - specialist individuals involved in the criminal trial process may have an insufficient understanding of the limitations of expert evidence , scientific evidence in particular . They may assume that just because an expert \u2019s evidence is presented as \u2018 scientific\u2019 it may be taken to be reliable . Certainly there is evidence to suggest that juries may find it difficult to understand or follow cross - examination aimed at revealing flaws in scientific methodology , a problem which is likely to be more acute if the evidence is complex . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In Attorney - General v. ORG and Others [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , ORG held that the word \u201c disclose \u201d in section CARDINAL of the DATE Act was apt to describe both offending revelations by a juror to a newspaper and the further disclosure of those revelations by their publication in the newspaper , provided that this amounted to a disclosure rather than re - publication of facts already known .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , Lord PERSON cited with approval a passage in a judgment of ORG in R v. PERSON SCC CARDINAL in which PERSON identified the principal reasons for the common law rule of jury secrecy in the following terms :", "\u201c The first reason supporting the need for secrecy is that confidentiality promotes candour and the kind of full and frank debate that is essential to this type of collegial decision making . While searching for unanimity , jurors should be free to explore out loud all avenues of reasoning without fear of exposure to public ridicule , contempt or hatred . This rationale is of vital importance to the potential acquittal of an unpopular accused , or CARDINAL charged with a particularly repulsive crime . In my view , this rationale is sound , and does not require empirical confirmation .", "ORG also placed considerable weight on the second rationale for the secrecy rule : the need to ensure finality of the verdict . Describing the verdict as the product of a dynamic process , the court emphasized the need to protect the solemnity of the verdict , as the product of the unanimous consensus which , when formally announced , carries the finality and authority of a legal pronouncement . That rationale is more abstract , and inevitably invites the question of why the finality of the verdict should prevail over its integrity in cases where that integrity is seriously put in issue . In a legal environment such as ours , which provides for generous review of judicial decisions on appeal , and which does not perceive the voicing of dissenting opinions on appeal as a threat to the authority of the law , I do not consider that finality , standing alone , is a convincing rationale for requiring secrecy .", "The respondent , as well as the interveners supporting its position and , in particular , the Attorney General of GPE , place great emphasis on the third main rationale for the jury secrecy rule \u2013 the need to protect jurors from harassment , censure and reprisals . Our system of jury selection is sensitive to the privacy interests of prospective jurors ... , and the proper functioning of the jury system , a constitutionally protected right in serious criminal charges , depends upon the willingness of jurors to discharge their functions honestly and honourably . This in turn is dependent , at the very minimum , on a system that ensures the safety of jurors , their sense of security , as well as their privacy . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
