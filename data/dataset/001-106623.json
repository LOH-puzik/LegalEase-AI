The applicant complained that lack of diligence on the part of the competent NORP authorities in assisting him in the enforcement procedure of a judgment in his favour had infringed his rights guaranteed by LAW and also his right to property as provided by LAW CARDINAL to the Convention . Insofar as relevant , these provisions read as follows :", "\u201c In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [ a ] ... tribunal ... \u201d", "\u201c Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions . No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law .", "The preceding provisions shall not , however , in any way impair the right of a ORG to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG considered the application incompatible ratione personae since the alleged violations were not imputable to the NORP authorities because the responsibility for enforcing the court decision lay with the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the NORP minister had complied with all the obligations arising from the bilateral agreement by forwarding the exequatur request to the NORP authorities . They further argued that the applicant had not been obliged to file his request via the NORP authorities , such a possibility being optional . ORG referred to the admissibility decision of DATE in the case of ORG v. GPE and GPE , where ORG had dismissed a similar complaint as incompatible ratione personae since the applicant had failed to file his request directly with the NORP authorities in accordance with the applicable law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contested any similarity to the case of ORG v. GPE and GPE ; in that case , at the request of the NORP authorities , the applicant should have filed the exequatur request directly with the competent NORP court , whereas in his own case the NORP Minister of ORG had suggested he contact the competent NORP court in order to file an exequatur request and had not considered the alternative of a direct application to the competent NORP court , which , according to the applicant , was in any event not feasible since the ORG addresses were unknown .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that according to the provisions of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the bilateral agreement the role of the NORP Minister of ORG is that of an intermediate authority whose role is to facilitate the enforcement process ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( A ) above ) . ORG can not reasonably claim that the NORP authorities alone were responsible for the enforcement of the domestic court decision and that the role of the NORP ministry was merely to forward the exequatur request to their counterparts . Further , ORG observes that LAW of the LAW provides for the possibility of filing an exequatur request directly with the competent court . However , in the present case the ORG notes that the addresses of the debtors , which determine the competent court , were not known ; it was only in DATE the NORP authorities acknowledged the addresses ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In addition , the ORG observes that ORG of ORG informed the applicant that the procedure to be followed was through the Minister of ORG as an intermediate authority ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , in the light of the above , the ORG concludes that the application is not incompatible ratione personae and that the ORG \u2019s objection should be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention . It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds . It must therefore be declared admissible .", "Merits", "CARDINAL . The Government argued that the authorities had fulfilled their obligations arising from the bilateral Treaty by forwarding the exequatur request to the NORP authorities . They argued that the provisions of the LAW did not impose any other obligations on the NORP authorities and it there was no obligation under LAW to monitor the outcome of the applicant \u2019s request . The fact that the applicant \u2019s exequatur request had not been registered in the data base of the NORP authorities was not imputable to the NORP authorities . All the documents of the Minister of ORG had been forwarded through ORG and there was no obligation for the central body receiving the documents to confirm that fact . With respect to the content of the exequatur request forwarded to the NORP authorities , the Government noted that the large number of requests by the applicant regarding the enclosures and the ORG addresses were not were not imputable to the fault of the NORP authorities , the sole responsibility of the Minister of ORG being to forward the documents , notwithstanding the fact that had been extensive correspondence between them and their NORP counterparts concerning the state of the proceedings . Moreover , the Government considered that PERSON No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL regarding international judiciary assistance in civil and commercial matters was not applicable in the present case since it did not specifically refer to the exequatur procedure ; hence the provision which provided for confirmation of the transmission of documents did not apply to the exequatur procedure .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contested these arguments . He argued that the NORP authorities had failed to fulfil their obligation under LAW and the above - mentioned PERSON No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL to assist him in the execution of a domestic court decision . He considered that the NORP authorities had not informed him very clearly about the procedure to follow in order to obtain the enforcement of the court decision in his favour and had not acted with diligence and celerity in order to ensure the effective exchange of information and correspondence between the intermediary institution and themselves .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that the execution of a judgment given by any court must be regarded as an integral part of the \u201c trial \u201d for the purposes of Article CARDINAL of the Convention ( GPE v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL ) . However , the right of \u201c access to court \u201d does not impose an obligation on a ORG to execute every judgment of a civil character without having regard to the particular circumstances of the case ( PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has a positive obligation to organise a system for enforcement of judgments that is effective both in law and in practice and ensures their enforcement without undue delay ( PERSON v. GPE , no . GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) . When the authorities are obliged to act in order to enforce a judgment and they fail to do so , their inactivity can engage the ORG \u2019s responsibility on the ground of LAW ( NORP v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINALC ) . It is for each ORG to equip itself with legal instruments which are adequate and sufficient to ensure the fulfilment of positive obligations imposed upon the ORG ( NORP v. GPE , no . GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) . The ORG \u2019s task is to examine whether the measures applied by the NORP authorities in the present case were adequate and sufficient . In cases such as the present one , which necessitate action by a debtor who is a private person , the ORG , as the agent of public authority , has to act diligently in order to assist a creditor in the execution of a judgment ( LOC v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 MONEY , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that in the present case the applicant obtained a final court decision on DATE ordering private individuals to pay him damages for the murder of his father . On DATE the applicant started the enforcement procedure before the NORP authorities . However , it was only in the course of DATE that the NORP authorities completed the file submitted to the NORP authorities in the exequatur procedure ( see paragraphs TIME above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further notes that the enforcement proceedings against CARDINAL of the debtors are still pending before the NORP authorities . Having regard to the fact that , in accordance with the provisions of LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( A ) ) , it is the law of the ORG of the debtor which governs the enforcement procedure , ORG will only examine whether the NORP authorities acted diligently in order to assist the applicant in the execution of the judgment of DATE as regards the obligations under the aforesaid LAW and the pertinent laws in force .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes repeated delays in the transmission of correspondence imputable to the NORP authorities , as a result of which the proceedings lasted DATE . It was only after repeated requests from the applicant that ORG inquired about the fate of the exequatur request and were thus informed that it had never reached the NORP authorities ( see paragraphs QUANTITY above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further notes that , notwithstanding the detailed provisions of LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL as to the procedure , form and content of such a request ( see relevant domestic and international law , paragraph CARDINAL above ) there were repeated shortcomings which led to delays in the transmission of documents between the domestic authorities and to the NORP authorities ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has dealt with cases raising issues similar to the ones in the present case and found violations of LAW ( see , among others , PERSON GPE and GPE , no . MONEY , DATE ; PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ; and ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above , the ORG considers that the respondent Government has not submitted any fact or argument leading to a different conclusion in the present case .", "CARDINAL . The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the ORG to conclude that in the present case ORG , through its specialised bodies , did not engage all the necessary efforts to assist the applicant in the expeditious enforcement of a court decision in his favour .", "There has accordingly been a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained that the non - enforcement of the impugned judgment breached his right to property as provided by LAW CARDINAL .", "However , in view of its previous findings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , the ORG considers that it is not necessary to examine this complaint separately .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c If the ORG finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto , and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made , the ORG shall , if necessary , afford just satisfaction to the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed CARDINAL Euros ( ORG ) in respect of pecuniary damage , representing the value of the debt , and ORG CARDINAL representing trial fees , taking account of the update of the damage amount up to DATE . He also claimed ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of nonpecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that , where it has found a breach of the Convention in a judgment , the respondent ORG is under a legal obligation to put an end to that breach and make reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach ( see GPE v. GPE ( just satisfaction ) [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-XI ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards pecuniary damage , the ORG notes that the judgment in favour of the applicant has not been enforced . However , considering the particular circumstances of the case notably that the enforcement proceedings are still pending before the NORP authorities and the fact that the present application is directed only against GPE , the ORG will not make an award under this head .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further considers that the applicant has suffered nonpecuniary damage on account of the frustration caused by the length of the enforcement proceedings and the fact that the NORP authorities have not diligently assisted him in his efforts to enforce the decision of DATE , and that this damage is not sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under these circumstances , having regard to all the information at its disposal and making an assessment on an equitable basis , as required by LAW , the ORG awards the applicant ORG CARDINAL in respect of non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also claimed ORG CARDINAL for the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings in the domestic courts and before this ORG , representing postal expenses , translations , experts\u2019 taxes , stamp duties and travel expenses . He submitted invoices .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG \u2019s case - law , an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum . In the present case , regard being had to the information in its possession and to the above criteria , the ORG considers it reasonable to award the sum of ORG CARDINAL covering the costs under all heads .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of ORG , to which should be added CARDINAL percentage points ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
