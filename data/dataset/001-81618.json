GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 8;No violation of Art. 8", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the mother of E , born on DATE . Her husband , the father of E , died in DATE . In DATE the applicant got acquainted with R , his wife G and their CARDINAL children , who were also living in GPE . The applicant and R started an intimate relationship which was tolerated by PERSON During that period , E was regularly taken care of by R and PERSON In DATE the applicant and R moved to GPE while E stayed in GPE with G and the other children . The applicant and R regularly spent the weekends in GPE with G and the children .", "CARDINAL . In DATE R and G moved with their children and E into a house in GPE while the applicant stayed in an apartment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant concluded an agreement with R and G concerning E 's care . The agreement indicated that E should continue to live with R and G as she had already done for DATE . Subsequently , the relation between the applicant , R and G deteriorated and the applicant 's attempts to visit E led to conflicts between them .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant filed an action with ORG ( ORG ) and requested that R and G be ordered to return PERSON In an expert opinion submitted on DATE the court - appointed expert ORG , having examined the applicant , E , R , G and CARDINAL of their children , considered that E repudiated the applicant and any relation to her family of origin . The expert considered that E had not formed any solid relations within the foster family and that the foster parents did not support her in her psychological development . The child 's problems had not been caused by the fact that her mother , who had originally deserted her , now laid claims on her , but by the fact that the child had been torn into the adults ' conflicts . She felt compelled to completely identify with the foster family and to suppress any individual emotions . This was aggravated by the fact that the foster family rejected the applicant , which was clear to the child even if it was not openly discussed within the family . The expert concluded that E was completely unable to cope with the current situation and that her stay with the foster family highly jeopardised her welfare . As there was no indication that R and G would change their attitude even if offered expert support , they were unfit to act as E 's foster parents . The expert strongly recommended that E should be taken from the foster family and placed in a therapeutic environment where her return to her mother could be prepared .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's action and ordered that E should remain with the foster family ( \u201c FAC \u201d pursuant to section DATE of LAW , see relevant domestic law , below ) . It considered that E suffered from severe personality disorders which originated from the fact that her mother had left her in DATE . In order to prevent E 's absolute dislocation , she should stay with the foster family and undergo out - patient psychological treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) rejected the applicant 's appeal . After having heard E , the court estimated that the foster parents had become E 's reference persons . E had indicated that she wished to stay with the foster parents whom she called \u201c mum and dad \u201d and that she regarded the applicant merely as the person who had given birth to her . The court held that a break with the environment she had become familiar with during DATE would definitely endanger her welfare .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) rejected the applicant 's further appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) refused to admit her constitutional complaint . It pointed out that the impugned decisions did not meet the constitutional standards as the courts had not sufficiently justified why they had decided contrary to the expert recommendations . There were serious doubts whether the courts had respected the importance of parental rights when giving their decisions and whether they had sufficiently taken into account the principle of proportionality . However , having regard to the fact that the case was meanwhile pending again before ORG and that the latter had ordered a new expert opinion ( see paragraph CARDINAL , below ) , the rejection of her constitutional complaint would not entail any significant disadvantages . The new procedure was likely to respect the applicant 's rights as a parent and to observe the principle of proportionality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a further action with the NORP ORG requesting that the foster parents be ordered to return E and , alternatively , a decision granting her access to E.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's requests , withdrew her custody rights regarding the determination of the child 's place of residence , her representation at school , her health care , the right to apply for public assistance and child benefits , and transferred these rights to ORG . The court observed that E had been living with the foster parents for DATE and that she considered the foster family as her own family . Since DATE , E had persistently refused to have any contact with the applicant and turned her back to her on the occasion of visiting contacts . Bearing in mind that E was DATE , the court considered her will as a decisive factor in the decision - making process . The apprehensions raised in the expert opinion dated DATE had been eliminated by the fact that the representative of ORG attested that E had developed normally and that her current behaviour showed no disturbances . E 's recent development confirmed that she benefited from the current situation because she was well - integrated in her family as well as in school . The court pointed out that a further expert opinion in this respect was thus not necessary . Furthermore , it had refrained from hearing E in order to spare her a further appearance before court . E had already testified on several occasions and \u2013 as the latest report of ORG revealed DATE had not changed her attitude . In order to ensure E 's proper medical care and her representation at school , it was necessary to transfer partial custody to ORG pursuant to LAW ( ORG \u2013 see relevant domestic law , below ) . Moreover , as the numerous attempts in the past to establish a contact between E and the applicant had failed , even with psychological supervision , the court refused to lay down any rules as to the applicant 's visiting rights . It deemed it impossible to force the DATE child to have contact with her mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against ORG decision . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing . On DATE ORG commissioned the psychological expert V to examine whether the child E should remain with the foster family and which access rights could be granted to the applicant without jeopardising the child 's well - being . On DATE the foster parents ' counsel brought a motion for bias against the expert V , which was dismissed by ORG on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed this decision on the ground that ORG had failed to hear the expert with respect to all of the allegations supporting the motion for bias . On DATE ORG , having heard the expert , once again dismissed the motion for bias . The foster parents ' complaint against this decision was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE and DATE , the applicant 's counsel had asked for time - limits to be extended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed a curator ad litem to represent E in the proceedings before that court . On DATE ORG rejected the foster parents ' complaint . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision on the ground that E 's interests were sufficiently safeguarded by her being represented by the social worker PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expert V was delivered the case - file . On DATE the social worker H , acting on E 's behalf , lodged a complaint against the order to take evidence , which was rejected by ORG on DATE and by ORG on DATE . DATE and DATE the expert held interviews with R , G , the child 's curator at ORG , the social worker H and E 's school director and class teacher . E refused to take part in the examination . The foster parents attempted to avoid examination and many appointments had to be postponed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG asked the expert when she would submit her expert opinion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expert submitted her opinion . She noted , at the outset , that the examination could only yield limited results because of the foster parents ' refusal to let her inspect the family home and E 's consistent refusal to take part in the examination . The expert further noted that E 's class teacher described her as a quiet child who appeared to be absent and seemed to be unable to express her emotions . The expert considered that E felt deserted by the applicant and therefore denied any relationship to her . The foster parents appeared to have enforced her negative attitude towards her natural mother and to have , as early as CARDINAL , done everything to keep E permanently within their family . It appeared that the foster parents had failed to encourage contacts between E and the applicant , but had rather tried to prevent such contacts . The adults ' actions had not always been guided by the child 's best interests , but rather by their desire to hurt one another . The expert further considered that the applicant understood and regretted her past shortcomings , but that she was not ready to respect E 's wish to stay with the foster family . R and G , on the other hand , did not acknowledge any misconduct on their side . In spite of certain doubts , the expert considered that R and G were in principle capable of taking care of E. It appeared , however , that E , while experiencing some sort of continuity in the foster family , had not built up stable relationships and that she suppressed any relation to her family of origin .", "CARDINAL . By way of conclusion , the expert considered it indispensable for the child 's development that she was given the opportunity to face her past . It was of utmost importance for E 's well - being to arrange contacts with her natural mother . The expert considered that E would be more open to such contacts if her wish to remain with the foster family was respected and if the judicial proceedings came to an end . Accordingly , the expert advised the court to order that E should remain with the foster family and to arrange supervised and gradually increasing contacts between E and the applicant . She further recommended that E be personally heard by ORG , as it had not been possible to hear her during the examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing . As the foster parents had lodged a motion for bias against the expert , ORG refrained from hearing the expert , as originally planned . The motion for bias was rejected on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a further oral hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal . Referring to the expert opinion , ORG considered that it was in E 's best interest to remain with the foster family , where she had experienced , for the first time in her life , continuity . It further considered that this was also in accordance with E 's own wishes and that E would reach her majority in DATE . On the basis of the expert opinion and taking into account E 's refusal to have any contacts with the applicant , ORG further considered that it would merely lead to further irritations if E was forced to have contact with her mother and therefore refrained from determining any visiting regulations . ORG further noted that E had been originally willing to be heard by the court but had felt offended by a statement made by the applicant 's counsel during a court hearing on DATE , who had alleged that the child would \u201c end up in prostitution , alcohol- or drug addiction \u201d if she remained in the foster family , and refused any further cooperation . Under these circumstances , the fact that E refused to be heard was at least partly imputable to the applicant 's counsel 's conduct .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's further appeal . ORG noted , at the outset , that the proceedings before ORG had lasted unduly long . This could , in general , not be accepted , in particular in proceedings which primarily concerned a child 's well - being . The court considered , however , that many requests , motions for bias , requests for extensions of time - limits and complaints lodged both by the applicant and the foster parents considerably delayed the proceedings . In any event , an excessive length of the proceedings could not influence the outcome of the applicant 's complaint .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the substance of the applicant 's complaint , ORG considered that the decision that E should stay with her foster parents was in accordance with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , because her removal would jeopardise the child 's welfare , taking into account the further period of time which had elapsed since ORG had given its decision and the fact that E would reach her majority within DATE . The court did not approve that DATE ever since E 's refusal to be heard by ORG in DATE the latter had failed to make further attempts to hear her and had failed , in particular , to summon her to the hearing in DATE . ORG presumed , however , that E 's consistent refusal to see her mother since the time when she had been DATE had been sufficient to convince ORG that E would not be ready to accept any compromises . As E maintained her attitude before ORG , that court also refrained from hearing E pursuant to section CARDINAL b \u00a7 CARDINAL of GPE ( PERSON \u00fcber die ORG der freiwilligen PERSON \u2013 see relevant domestic law , below ) . ORG further noted that ORG , in its decision given on DATE , had not given any binding guidelines for the present proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG finally considered that there was no room for a regulation on access rights for DATE until E would reach majority . It noted that E consistently rejected her mother and did not wish to have any contact with her . ORG observed that ORG might have given up prematurely in this respect and that it had failed to set a time - limit to the exclusion of access rights . However , given the lapse of time , it was not suitable to correct this decision , as DATE would not suffice to start a pertinent therapy and instigate contacts between mother and daughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant 's constitutional complaint . It pointed out that the length of the proceedings was very critical . It observed furthermore that the courts had failed to appoint an independent curator ad litem to represent E in the proceedings as provided for in LAW . However , in view of the fact that E would reach her majority on DATE , the rejection of the constitutional complaint would not entail any significant disadvantage for the applicant . This decision was served on the applicant 's counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG decreed E 's adoption by R and PERSON The applicant contested this decision before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Civil Code", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW of LAW ( ORG ) parental responsibility ( Personensorge ) comprehends the right to order anybody \u2013 who unlawfully deprives the parents or CARDINAL parent of their child \u2013 to have their child returned .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that DATE if the parents intend to take away a child from the foster parents the child has been living with for some time \u2013 ORG may order the child 's stay with the foster parents if and as long as the child 's removal would jeopardise his or her welfare .", "CARDINAL . According to section DATE , a child is entitled to have access to its parents ; each parent is obliged to have contact with , and entitled to have access to , the child . The family courts can , however , restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child 's welfare . A decision restricting or suspending that right for a lengthy period or permanently may only be taken if otherwise the child 's well - being would be endangered ( section DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
