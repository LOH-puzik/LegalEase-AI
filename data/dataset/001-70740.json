{"ITEMID": "001-70740", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "WARREN v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national who was born in DATE and is currently serving a prison sentence in the GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr J. Jahae , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant was placed in pre - trial detention ( voorlopige hechtenis ) on DATE . The criminal proceedings brought against the applicant \u2013 in which he stood accused of , inter alia , leading a criminal organisation , importation of QUANTITY of cocaine and possession of ORG , marihuana and weapons \u2013 came to an end on DATE , when ORG ( PERSON ) confirmed the judgment handed down by ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE on DATE in which the applicant had been sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "The applicant , who had initially been detained in an ordinary remand centre ( huis van bewaring ) , was transferred DATE on the basis of a report from ORG ( PERSON ORG ; \u201c GRIP / CRI \u201d ) according to which there were indications that the applicant would seek ways to escape DATE on DATE to ORG ) in a GPE detention facility .", "On DATE , on the basis of further GRIP information and the advice of the special selection board of the maximum - security institution ( NORP PERSON ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) \u2013 the Minister of ORG decided to place the applicant in the pre - trial detention unit in the ORG which is part of the PERSON Penitentiary Complex in FAC . According to this further GRIP information , set out in an official report ( ambtsbericht ) dated DATE , the applicant represented an increased security risk in that in case of an escape , outside aid with use of brute force , violence against persons and a hostage - taking situation could not be excluded . In this connection , it was pointed out that he was a member of a criminal organisation , that various kinds of firearms and hand grenades had been found when members of this organisation had been arrested , that some members \u2013 including the applicant \u2019s right - hand man \u2013 were still at large , that the organisation was said to dispose of explosives and heavy arms such as rocket launchers , and that in the course of previous arrests of members of the organisation in GPE , CARDINAL person escaped when the police transport was blocked by a vehicle . It was further pointed out that the authorities of GPE , where the applicant was to serve a CARDINAL years\u2019 prison sentence , had filed a request for his extradition .", "The applicant \u2019s detention in the ORG was reviewed and prolonged by the Minister DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant was attacked in the ORG by another detainee who was lethally injured by the applicant in the ensuing fight . Criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant which ended on DATE when ORG confirmed the judgment given by the \u2018 s - ORG on DATE , in which it had rejected the applicant \u2019s plea of self - defence , convicted him of manslaughter and imposed a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "By letter of DATE , the applicant was informed that the Minister of ORG had decided to extend his placement in the ORG once again . This decision was based on the contents of the official report of DATE , the possibility of the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE where DATE according to the applicant \u2019s own statement DATE he would still have to serve a CARDINAL years\u2019 prison sentence , and a further official report of DATE , according to which there were plans to liberate the applicant from detention , involving the deployment of a helicopter by a member of the criminal organisation who had escaped on DATE from a GPE detention facility by way of a well prepared escape plan . Further pointing out that the applicant had been sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and that he had been convicted in first instance in another set of criminal proceedings in connection with the death of a co - detainee to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , the Minister considered that it appeared from the above that the applicant \u2019s escape would give rise to great social upheaval . Since , moreover , the ORG special selection board \u2013 having noted the above as well as the grave concern in society and public opinion concerning the crimes committed by the applicant \u2013 had advised the Minister to prolong the applicant \u2019s detention in the ORG , the Minister had taken a decision to this effect .", "The applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG ( beroepscommissie ) of ORG ( PERSON GPE ) . In this appeal , he challenged the necessity to prolong his placement in the ORG , arguing inter alia that it had been based on outdated information , that his conduct in the ORG had been correct throughout , that he had not caused the fight with the co - detainee , and that there were no reasons for holding that he would harbour any escape plans . Although he did make a general reference to the findings of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) as regards the ORG regime , he did not present any arguments about the manner in which this regime would have affected him personally . He further did not raise any complaints , either in form or substance , under LAW in relation to his personal conditions of detention in the ORG .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal . It noted that the applicant had been sentenced to a lengthy prison sentence for very serious crimes giving rise to grave concern in society and public opinion , and DATE in addition \u2013 he had been sentenced in first instance to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment in relation to a fight in the ORG with a fatal outcome . It therefore considered that the applicant , in the event of an escape , would pose an unacceptable risk to society in terms of severe disturbance of public order , the risk of escape being , as such , of lesser importance , i.e. the situation provided for in LAW selection , placement and transfer of detainees ( PERSON , plaatsing en overplaatsing van gedetineerden ) of DATE . ORG further concluded that , having found no facts or circumstances militating against a continuation of the applicant \u2019s stay in the ORG , the decision to prolong his placement was lawful and that , weighing up all the interests involved , it could not be considered as unreasonable or unjust .", "On DATE , the applicant was transferred to a prison with an ordinary regime in GPE .", "An overview of the relevant domestic law and practice is given in the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of PERSON the GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
