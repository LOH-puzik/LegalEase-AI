GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant company is a private bank in the form of a limited liability company that was set up in DATE and has its head office at GPE ( GPE ) . It is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as presented by the applicant company , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant company has CARDINAL main activities , which are closely connected . Firstly , it offers a service for tracing missing heirs ( ORG ) with a view to being subsequently instructed to wind up the deceased \u2019s estate . It traces heirs , whether or not their identity is known , both in GPE and overseas , either on behalf of authorities or institutions such as the testamentary executors or the administrators , or of its own initiative . It does so at its own risk and bears the costs . It receives no down payment and , if it fails to locate the heirs , no remuneration . Secondly , once it has traced the heirs , it offers its services in winding up the estate ( GPE ) , for which it is paid a fee of PERCENT of the value of the estate .", "Under the first sentence of the first paragraph of LAW ( Rechtsberatungsgesetz \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , the applicant company was in DATE granted the licence it required to carry on its activity . It remained licensed until DATE .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( ORG ) held that missing - heir tracing services were commercial ( gewerblich ) in character and that there was a close connection between that activity and the winding up of estates . Accordingly , the applicant company was required to pay a ORG tax ( ORG ) .", "Following that judgment , in which ORG ruled only on fiscal issues , the applicant company decided in DATE to surrender its licence under section CARDINAL ) of LAW and to carry on its business unlicensed , on the basis of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . At the time both the President of ORG and ORG ( Bundesrechtsanwaltskammer ) considered that the applicant company did not require a licence to carry on its activity .", "Subsequently CARDINAL separate sets of proceedings were brought against the applicant company .", "I. The first action was brought in DATE by ORG relying on LAW and LAW ( PERSON gegen den unlauteren PERSON ) . ORG submitted in particular that following a DATE amendment the applicant company \u2019s activity no longer fell within the terms of LAW , and accordingly the company could not receive a licence for it .", "The applicant company contended that owing to the close connection between tracing heirs and winding up estates it was not required to have a licence under LAW .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) accepted the applicant company \u2019s argument finding that its activity of giving legal advice in the winding up of estates was a direct offshoot of its main commercial activity as genealogists .", "On an appeal by ORG , ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) overruled ORG judgment on DATE and made an order restraining the applicant company from acting or offering to act for heirs ( PERSON ) , since it did not have the requisite licence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . ORG considered that the genealogical activity was merely a way of finding clients in order to obtain work winding up estates , that being the main profit - making activity of the applicant company and CARDINAL for which a licence was required . Furthermore , the genealogical activity was not necessarily connected to that of winding up estates as the CARDINAL could be carried on separately . In any event , the latter was not under any circumstances a subsidiary legal activity capable of coming within the exceptions set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW . Lastly , that construction of the provision did not infringe the relevant provisions of LAW .", "ORG granted the applicant company DATE to make the change on condition that it immediately sought the requisite licence under LAW .", "The applicant company made a request for a licence to the competent authorities , but it was turned down . The President of ORG stated in particular that the request , which was for a licence to act on behalf of heirs , fell outside the categories of activities set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . That statute had been amended in DATE and the range of services which legal advisers were entitled to offer substantially curtailed , the right to perform most legal services being reserved to lawyers . Consequently , licences could be granted only for such activities as were exhaustively set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . The activity referred to by the applicant company was not CARDINAL of them .", "At the same time the applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( ORG ) , which was dismissed in a judgment of DATE . Like ORG , ORG considered that the applicant company could not act in the winding up of estates without the requisite licence .", "The applicant company then lodged a constitutional appeal with ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) . Sitting as a committee of CARDINAL judges , ORG decided on CARDINAL DATE to dismiss that appeal .", "II . The second action against the applicant company was brought in DATE by ORG on the same grounds as those relied on in the first action .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found in favour of ORG .", "ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal on DATE .", "Its appeal on points of law to ORG was also dismissed , in a judgment of DATE .", "The applicant company then lodged a constitutional appeal with ORG , which , sitting as a committee of CARDINAL judges , decided on CARDINAL DATE to dismiss the appeal .", "LAW ( Rechtsberatungsgesetz ) , which came into force in DATE , provides that the profession of legal adviser ( PERSON ) may , subject to certain conditions , be exercised by people not possessing legal qualifications .", "The first sentence of the first paragraph of LAW ) states that \u201c regardless of whether it constitutes a main or subsidiary activity or is performed for a fee or free of charge , legal work ( GPE fremder GPE ) , including the giving of legal advice , may be performed for third parties only by persons licensed to do so by the relevant authorities \u201d .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides : \u201c the fact that commercial or industrial undertakings perform legal work for their customers that is closely connected to their main activity ( die FAC ihres GPE in unmittelbarem GPE stehen ) shall not constitute an infringement of this Act \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
