At TIME on DATE the applicant and PERSON , after having consumed alcohol , went to the flat of PERSON , apparently with the intention of recovering certain items which Mr PERSON \u2019s former girlfriend had left there . A violent incident ensued and the police , who were called by neighbours , arrested the applicant and Mr D.M.", "CARDINAL . On DATE a police officer drew up a report describing the applicant \u2019s conduct on the previous evening . On the basis of this report , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE the mayor of GPE found the applicant guilty of breaching section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of municipal by - law no . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and fined him MONEY ( ORG ) . The mayor explained that , while drunk , the applicant had broken down the door of PERSON flat and had beaten him up . These actions had constituted a breach of public order and an expression of manifest disregard towards society , contrary to the above - mentioned provision . The decision , which specified that it was subject to judicial review within DATE after being served on the offender , was not served on the applicant , whose address was unknown . It was put in the file and considered as constructively served under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Administrative Offences and Penalties Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant did not learn about it within the timelimit for seeking judicial review and the decision became final .", "CARDINAL . NORP Some time later the prosecution authorities charged the applicant with inflicting \u201c intermediate \u201d bodily harm on Mr G.I. , contrary to LAW , and breaking into his home , contrary to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .

It found him not guilty of committing this offence in concert with others and not guilty of entering another \u2019s home by force . It sentenced him to QUANTITY . The court found that PERSON alone had broken down the door of PERSON flat and that the applicant had entered the flat after him . The court further found that in the ensuing scuffle the applicant had broken CARDINAL of Mr G.I. \u2019s teeth , which amounted to \u201c intermediate \u201d bodily harm , but at the same time held that in committing this act the applicant had not acted in concert with PERSON , because the latter had not hit Mr G.I. in the head .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . He drafted the appeal himself . Mr D.M. did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on TIME . The counsel previously appointed by the court for the applicant did not show up and new counsel was thus appointed . The applicant said that the new counsel was acquainted with his arguments and the case , and that he agreed to be defended by her .

In her closing speech , counsel for the applicant argued that it was not certain whether he had hit Mr G.I. in the head .

It was furthermore unclear whether the blows allegedly administered by the applicant could result in the type of injuries sustained by Mr G.I. The experts\u2019 statements on this point had not been properly recorded . Counsel later filed a memorial previously drawn up by the applicant .", "CARDINAL .

ORG held a hearing on DATE . The applicant acted pro se . The prosecution argued that his appeal should be dismissed . On DATE ORG , which had the power to quash , vary or reverse the lower court \u2019s judgment , decided to uphold it .

Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE LAW makes it an offence to inflict \u201c intermediate \u201d bodily harm on another .

It was true that certain limitations on the rights of the defence were permissible under LAW in the interest of the proper administration of justice .
