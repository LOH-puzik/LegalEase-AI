In the course of the proceedings the tax authorities failed to present the trial court with the original of the Findings of Fact of CARDINAL DATE , because they could not find it in their archives . An uncertified copy of the said document was nevertheless presented to the trial court .", "In a judgment of DATE the ORG found partly in favour of the applicant , quashed the DATE tax assessment in respect of the deductibility of input ORG in the amount of ORG ( ORG CARDINAL ) and upheld the remainder .", "On an unspecified date , ORG filed a cassation appeal against the judgment of ORG to partly quash the DATE tax assessment in respect of the deductibility of input ORG in the amount of ORG ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .

As a result , when ORG conducted the second NORP audit in DATE they applied LAW ( CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) of LAW to assess the tax position of the applicant ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) . In the course of the said tax audit the authorities examined the records that the applicant did present and also performed cross - checks of most of the suppliers from which he claimed to have received supplies .", "In the DATE tax assessment the ORG refused the applicant the right to deduct input ORG on the grounds that ( a ) some of his suppliers did not have a valid NORP registration or ( b ) he had failed to present them with ORG invoices or copies thereof , evidencing that he had received VAT chargeable supplies .", "In finding partly in favour of the applicant , ORG in its judgment of DATE considered that the tax authorities had correctly applied the procedure for assessing the applicant 's tax position in view of the missing accounting records . However , it considered that the information contained in the Findings of CARDINAL of DATE should be considered as evidence of the applicant 's NORP compliance status for DATE in respect of those suppliers that the tax authorities had not cross - checked . ORG therefore quashed the DATE tax assessment as it related to such suppliers and in respect of the supplies that the applicant had received from CARDINAL suppliers which it considered had valid ORG registrations .", "In its final judgment of DATE ORG found that the Findings of Fact of DATE can not be considered as evidence of the applicant 's NORP compliance status for DATE , and also found that the tax authorities had correctly applied the procedure for assessing the applicant 's tax position in view of the missing accounting records , which the latter had failed to reconstitute . It therefore upheld the part of the DATE tax assessment that had been quashed by ORG and dismissed the applicant 's appeal .", "On DATE the applicant company executed a notary deed with another company ( \u201c the seller \u201d ) for the purchase of land and an unfinished QUANTITY building situated on it .

The seller and the applicant company reported the transfer of the unfinished CARDINAL - storey building in the DATE VAT reporting period and the latter claimed a deduction of the input NORP of ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) it had paid on the transaction .", "On DATE ORG of ORG issued the applicant company with a tax assessment ( \u201c the DATE tax assessment \u201d ) whereby it refused the right to deduct the input LAW CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) that the applicant company had paid under the CARDINAL invoices from CARDINAL and DATE for the purchase of the unfinished QUANTITY building .", "On DATE the applicant company appealed against the DATE tax assessment .", "On DATE ORG upheld the DATE tax assessment .", "On DATE the applicant company appealed to the courts .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal of the applicant company and upheld the DATE tax assessment .", "On an unspecified date the applicant company lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment of ORG .", "In a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company 's appeal , but on slightly different grounds from those relied on by GPE ( see following section ) .", "In its decision of DATE ORG considered that the VAT - chargeable supply for the transfer of the unfinished QUANTITY building had been effected , for the purposes of NORP taxation , on DATE when the transaction had been registered with a notary . Thus , the ORG invoice in respect of the transaction had had to be issued within DATE of that event and the ORG had had to be charged , reported and paid to the ORG budget in respect of the DATE VAT reporting period . In so far as that had been done belatedly in the DATE VAT reporting period , it found that no right to deduct the input NORP arose for the applicant company .", "In its appeal of DATE the applicant company argued that although the notary deed had been executed on DATE it included CARDINAL separate transactions \u2013 CARDINAL for the purchase of the land and CARDINAL for the unfinished QUANTITY building . While the first had been fully settled on DATE of the notary deed , the second had only been concluded when the purchase price of the unfinished QUANTITY building had been paid in DATE . In so far as the sale of land did not amount to a VAT chargeable supply , no ORG invoices had been issued nor reported in the DATE VAT reporting period . As the parties had contracted that payment of the price of the unfinished QUANTITY building would be made on DATE , the seller had issued ORG invoices in respect of it on CARDINAL and DATE which the applicant company had duly paid . Thus , the applicant company considered that the NORP chargeable supply in respect of the unfinished QUANTITY building had not arisen on DATE , but on CARDINAL and DATE when the seller had issued the ORG invoices .", "In its judgment of DATE ORG concluded that the execution of the notary deed on DATE amounted to a NORP chargeable supply in respect of the unfinished QUANTITY building , that ORG invoices in respect of it should have been issued within DATE and that the transaction should have been reported in the DATE VAT reporting period . ORG relied on LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , which stated that a GPE - chargeable event arises on DATE of the ( a ) the date on which a property right is transferred or ( b ) the date on which full or partial payment is made . It therefore concluded that in so far as the property rights to the unfinished QUANTITY building had been transferred on DATE the parties ' undertaking to pay the purchase price at DATE did not postpone the date of the VAT - chargeable event , and the transaction should have been reported in the DATE VAT reporting period rather than in the DATE reporting period . Accordingly , as the transaction had been erroneously reported by both the seller and the applicant company , no right to deduct the input NORP arose for the latter .", "In its final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company 's cassation appeal on slightly different grounds from those relied on by GPE . It also found that the GPE - chargeable event was the transfer of the property rights to the unfinished QUANTITY building on DATE , but noted that the applicant company did not have a VAT registration at the time so , in any event , it would not have had the right to deduct the input ORG in that reporting period . However , at the time of its VAT registration in DATE the applicant company could have requested that the tax authorities recognise its right to deduct the input NORP on the transaction under a special procedure applicable to LOC transactions effected prior to obtaining a VAT registration . In so far as the applicant company had failed to make such a request , no right to deduct the input ORG on the supply in question prior to its GPE registration arose .", "On DATE ORG issued the applicant with a tax assessment ( \u201c the DATE tax assessment \u201d ) . It refused the applicant 's right to deduct input ORG she had paid on , inter alia , CARDINAL supplies dating from DATE which totalled ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , on which interest for late payment was also charged in the amount of ORG MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the DATE tax assessment .", "On DATE the GPE section of ORG upheld the DATE tax assessment in its entirety .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to the courts .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the DATE tax assessment .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment of ORG .", "In a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It found that the applicant had failed to show , both during the audit conducted by the tax authorities and during the court proceedings , that the supplies in question had ever actually been received by her , which was sufficient ground for refusing the right to deduct the ORG paid under the issued invoices , irrespective of whether they had been properly accounted for by her suppliers .", "In the course of the audit conducted by the tax authorities , ORG noted that the supplies in question had been provided for marketing , advertising , agency and intermediary services . They examined the accounting records of the applicant , performed cross - checks of the suppliers in question , and obtained further clarifications and submissions from the parties . As CARDINAL of the suppliers were not found at their registered tax addresses , the authorities instead examined and relied on their tax dossiers , which are held by the tax authorities . Notably , these CARDINAL suppliers were registered at the same address .", "In the DATE tax assessment the ORG refused the right to deduct the input NORP on the CARDINAL supplies from DATE because the applicant 's suppliers had failed to present the requisite proof for assessment of their tax liabilities , including evidence that they had actually carried out the supplies in question . In particular , the tax authorities found that the suppliers lacked the necessary know - how as well as the technological and human resources to provide the contracted services , while the applicant could not remember what specific services she had received from each of them . In addition , the applicant failed to provide copies of all the contracts underlying the transactions in question , the marketing reports and the results of the agency and intermediary services allegedly received .", "In her appeal to the courts the applicant argued that the cross - checks conducted on her suppliers were not carried out in conformity with the applicable procedure , which allegedly predetermined their lack of success , and that the tax authorities had come to the wrong conclusions on the basis of the records and documents in their possession .", "In its judgment of DATE ORG found certain procedural deficiencies in the cross - checks performed by the tax authorities and in some of their assessments concerning the availability of technological and human resources by some of the suppliers , but did not consider them significant enough to negate the overall conclusions that it had not been shown by the parties that the services had in fact been provided . In particular , it noted that irrespective of whether the suppliers had properly recorded and reported the supplies in question , the applicant had failed to provide the requisite proof that the transactions in questions had ever been affected , that all the underlying contracts for the services existed , and that the invoiced services had ever been received by , for example , presenting marketing reports , brochures or advertising materials produced as a result of these transactions . Finally , the court noted that the CARDINAL missing traders were all located at the same address and all purported to provide the same type of advertising and marketing services , proof of which the applicant had failed to present to the tax authorities .", "In its final judgment of DATE ORG also found that the applicant had failed to show , both during the audit conducted by the tax authorities and during the court proceedings , that the supplies in question had actually ever been received by her and that there had , therefore , been VAT - chargeable supplies within the meaning of LAW of DATE . It noted that this was sufficient ground to refuse the right to deduct the input ORG paid under the issued invoices , irrespective of whether they had been properly accounted for by her suppliers .", "On DATE the GPE Territorial Tax Directorate issued the applicant company with a tax assessment ( \u201c the DATE tax assessment \u201d ) . It refused , inter alia , the applicant company 's right to deduct the input ORG it had paid to CARDINAL suppliers of services in DATE in the amount of ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) , on which interest for late payment was also charged . The supplies in question were for construction works undertaken by the suppliers to complete CARDINAL buildings that the applicant company was constructing .", "On an unspecified date the applicant company appealed against the DATE tax assessment .", "On DATE ORG upheld the DATE tax assessment in respect of the refusal to authorise deduction of the input ORG .", "On an unspecified date the applicant company appealed to the courts , claiming that the tax authorities had applied the relevant tax legislation erroneously and had committed various procedural violations .", "In the course of the court proceedings ORG commissioned , at the request of the applicant company , CARDINAL expert reports to assess the findings of the DATE tax assessment .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the DATE tax assessment in respect of the deductibility of the input ORG .", "On an unspecified date the applicant company lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment of ORG . It claimed that the first - instance court judgment was wrong and that there had been various procedural violations .", "By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the judgment of GPE in its entirety .", "Under DATE tax assessment , as upheld by ORG and the courts , the applicant company was refused deduction of the input ORG it had paid to the CARDINAL suppliers of services in DATE , because there was no VAT - chargeable supply within the meaning of LAW of DATE .", "In the course of the audit carried out of the applicant company , the authorities visited the construction sites to evaluate the type of construction works performed and their level of completion . They also carried out cross - checks on the suppliers . Although initially they were not found at their registered addresses , after further searches and notifications by the authorities representatives of the suppliers came forward and produced some of the records and documentation that had been requested of them . The authorities then evaluated the construction equipment and materials available at the suppliers , their know - how to perform such services and the human resource capabilities at their disposal . In addition , they performed cross - checks of companies from whom construction equipment had allegedly been rented and of individuals who had allegedly carried out the work . A detailed evaluation of the various construction works carried out was also undertaken and an assessment made of whether they could have been carried out by the CARDINAL suppliers . As a result , the authorities concluded that the CARDINAL suppliers lacked the material , technological and human resources capability to provide the services on the dates on which they were allegedly received by the applicant company . In particular , they were found to lack the necessary construction equipment , machines , tools , materials and facilities to deliver the services in question and also lacked qualified workers who could have done the work . Separately , the tax authorities found that the suppliers had invoiced for services which were outside the scope of the construction works allegedly received by the applicant company . In respect of some of the construction works , the tax authorities also established that they had been invoiced DATE after the work had been done . Lastly , the authorities acknowledged that construction services had been received by the applicant company in the course of the completion of its sites , but considered that it had not been proven that they had been carried out by the suppliers in question and that these transactions amounted to GPE - chargeable supplies which gave the applicant company the right to deduct the input ORG .", "On the basis of the above findings , the commissioned expert reports and the submissions of the parties , the courts carried out a similar detailed analysis of the services provided and the capabilities of the suppliers to provide them . They reached identical conclusions to those of the tax authorities and found that the CARDINAL suppliers lacked the material , technological and human resources capacity to do the work .", "The general principles in LAW DATE regarding the chargeability and reporting of GPE as well as the right to deduct input ORG are similar to those of LAW DATE , as summarised in the ORG v. GPE judgment ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "Under LAW of DATE , the input ORG , known as \u201c the tax credit \u201d under domestic legislation , was the amount of ORG which a taxable person had been charged on goods or services received under a chargeable transaction or from import of goods or services ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "In addition , section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provided , as relevant , the following :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The right to [ deduct input ORG ] arises when the following conditions are met :", "CARDINAL . the [ taxable ] person to whom tax is charged is registered under LAW on the date the tax invoice ... is issued ;", "CARDINAL .
