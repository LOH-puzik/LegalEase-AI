He was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant \u2019s appeal against both conviction and sentence was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the applicant had managed the resources of the above - mentioned ORG as if it were his private property and spent them for purposes other than those of the ORG .

CARDINAL , as from the date of his conviction by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an application with ORG requesting that the decision to dismiss him from the public service be declared null and void .

ORG stated that it could neither control the severity of the sentence imposed by a disciplinary organ , except if the latter exceeded the limits of its margin of appreciation , nor the manner in which the organ assessed the facts of the case . It held that the discretion of ORG only concerned the nature of the sanction , the loss of the retirement benefits being the normal consequence of the particular sanction imposed by the Commission . As for the right not to be punished twice for the same act , ORG held that \u201c criminal and disciplinary proceedings may be pursued simultaneously or in succession in respect of the same conduct , in recognition of the fact that the CARDINAL proceedings are designed to serve separate and distinct purposes \u201d and that \u201c the same act may constitute both a criminal and a disciplinary offence ; that this is so , is no obstacle to the institution of disciplinary proceedings , nor a conviction upon a disciplinary charge similar in nature to an offence created by LAW ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

He conceded the withdrawal of the other grounds of appeal . Subsequently , the lawyer declared that \u201c he did not raise any other issue on this point ( forfeiture of pension rights ) as a separate and autonomous right because it was a very big issue \u201d . However , it transpires from the pleadings that the applicant \u2019s lawyer expressly stated that he would deal with grounds CARDINAL and DATE , which also implied ground CARDINAL .
