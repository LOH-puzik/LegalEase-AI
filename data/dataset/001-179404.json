The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was arrested and taken to a police station . Allegedly , police officers threatened him with murder and ill - treatment if he refused to make a confession . In the presence of counsel , he made a written statement confessing to a murder . On DATE an investigator compiled an arrest record .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another investigator issued a formal decision confirming that PERSON \u2019s real name was PERSON , the applicant in the present case before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of PERSON ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Regional Court \u201d ) upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicant had tested positive for HIV .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE ( see below ) he learnt that in DATE or DATE PERSON , a deputy district prosecutor , had given PERSON , the sister of the murder victim , access to the file concerning the criminal charges against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the trial court granted PERSON victim status in the criminal case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . At the same time , the trial court allowed a decision granting PERSON victim status to be added to the file ( a decision apparently taken in DATE by an unspecified authority during the criminal investigation \u2013 however , see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . PERSON was cross - examined at that hearing . She stated that she had had access to the file and had then told NORP , the applicant \u2019s relative , about his HIV status to prove that the applicant was not a good person . According to the applicant , PERSON also disclosed his HIV status to some other neighbours .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant unsuccessfully sought the institution of criminal proceedings against PERSON for the disclosure of private information , which was an offence under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It appears that the applicant also sought the institution of criminal proceedings against PERSON in relation to the disclosure of private information involving the use of an official position and abuse of power ( LAW and LAW ; see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . A pre - investigation inquiry was carried out for the offence allegedly committed by PERSON", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE Z. , the deputy district prosecutor , wrote to the applicant indicating that PERSON had not been granted victim status , and that the investigator in charge of the case had not provided her with access to the file during the preliminary investigation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the regional prosecutor \u2019s office informed the applicant that PERSON had been granted victim status and had studied the case file in DATE , she had not applied for victim status before that time , and there were no grounds for any pre - investigation inquiry in respect of PERSON It is unclear whether the applicant took any further action as regards his criminal complaint against Z.", "CARDINAL . As a result of the inquiry in respect of PERSON , a refusal to institute criminal proceedings was issued . It was then overruled . Further refusals to prosecute were issued on DATE and CARDINAL DATE and on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to carry out judicial review of the refusal dated DATE . ORG then considered that the applicant was entitled to judicial review and ordered ORG to re - examine the issue . In the resumed proceedings , on CARDINAL DATE ORG noted that the applicant no longer wished to pursue the judicial complaint , and discontinued it .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE an investigator had issued a new refusal to prosecute with reference to the expiry of the DATE timelimit for prosecution of an offence under LAW . The investigator heard NORP , who confirmed that PERSON had briefly mentioned the applicant \u2019s HIV status . The investigator \u2019s decision indicates that he considered the disclosure of the applicant \u2019s medical data an established fact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the refusal to prosecute dated DATE . The judge noted ( apparently with reference to DATE ) that for some time the institution of criminal proceedings had been refused because \u201c at the time no written statement could be obtained from [ the applicant ] in relation to his complaint \u201d . This had prompted the supervising prosecutor to set aside , among other things , the refusals to prosecute dated DATE and CARDINAL DATE and DATE . The prosecutor had acted promptly by taking decisions on DATE and DATE and on DATE . Following each decision , law - enforcement officers had taken measures to interview the applicant ( apparently by asking staff at his remand centre to interview him ) , but \u201c no statement had been received from him \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The appeal court stated that , while the fact of the dissemination of the applicant \u2019s medical data by PERSON had been established , she could not be prosecuted , owing to the expiry of the time - limit for prosecution . However , those grounds for discontinuing the case were , in a way , in the applicant \u2019s interest , and it remained open to him to bring civil proceedings against her .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant brought civil court proceedings against PERSON , seeking compensation for non - pecuniary damage on account of the disclosure of his HIV status to other people . On DATE ORG discontinued the case because the respondent was a foreign national not residing in GPE . Apparently , the applicant did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also lodged a claim under LAW . A judge rejected it , noting that the LAW did not give standing to a criminal complainant with no \u201c victim \u201d status seeking compensation on account of the length of a pre - investigation inquiry . Apparently , the applicant did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant provided the following account of his conditions of detention .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant was kept in FAC no .

DATE the applicant lodged numerous complaints in relation to his conditions of detention . For instance , on DATE ORG of GPE dismissed CARDINAL of his complaints , whilst indicating that the actual number of detainees in the remand centre exceeded the design capacity of this detention facility . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the administration of the remand centre informed the applicant that the actual capacity of cells was such as to afford each detainee QUANTITY of space , which was a temporary measure related to the overpopulation problem .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the GPE prosecutor \u2019s office supervising prisons confirmed that the applicant had been afforded between QUANTITY of cell space .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office of GPE informed the applicant that , following an inspection , it could be not confirmed that the cell toilets were not separated from the main area ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
