On DATE CARDINAL forensic experts working for ORG , acting on a request from ORG , concluded that the large number of injuries on PERSON head , chest , back , arms and legs could not have been caused by jumping from a window or by falling down while running .

It appears from the judgment that , immediately after the killing , a number of villagers had seen bloodstains in the garden where the applicants claimed PERSON was shot and killed . They had informed the prosecutor about this but the prosecutor had made no mention of it in his report . The judgment discloses that the applicants had told the investigating authorities that after the shooting the soldiers had collected bloodstained soil from their garden and put it in a box .

This box was subsequently examined for fingerprints but no matching prints were found .", "CARDINAL . NORP The trial court noted that the first time the applicants had given evidence to the investigating authorities was DATE after the killing ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In the opinion of the trial court , the applicants ' failure to make statements in the immediate aftermath of the events showed that the applicants had not witnessed the killing , but had made the allegations in order to blame the State for it . Thus , not only the statements made by the applicants but also the statements made by their witnesses were not to be relied on in evidence . On the other hand , there were no legal reasons to disregard the conclusions of the investigations carried out by the soldiers who had themselves had taken part in the investigation . It was \u201c impossible \u201d that the soldiers would collude in order to protect the first lieutenant by blaming private PERSON . The fact that the search carried out by those soldiers revealed no traces of bloodstains in the garden was sufficient to conclude that PERSON had not been killed as alleged by the applicants . According to the trial court , a lack of spent bullet cases discharged from private PERSON rifle did not necessarily show that the real perpetrator was somebody else .", "CARDINAL . The trial court also considered that ORG above - mentioned conclusion ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) discredited the applicants ' allegation that PERSON had been killed in the garden by the first lieutenant and that his body had then been dragged by the soldiers . According to the \u201c experience of the judiciary \u201d , the injuries could have been caused by PERSON falling down the hill while he was trying to escape and by soldiers who were trying to apprehend him . The fact that PERSON had been involved in a scuffle with the soldiers who tried to apprehend him was borne out by medical reports showing that the CARDINAL soldiers had suffered injuries ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) .", "CARDINAL . With the exception of private PERSON who had been charged with manslaughter , the trial court acquitted all the defendants \u2013 that is prosecutor PERSON , first lieutenant PERSON , non - commissioned officer PERSON , expert sergeant PERSON and the privates who took part in the operation . The trial court considered that private PERSON had not acted with an intention to kill ; he had pulled the trigger with the aim of catching PERSON and had considered that it would only injure him and not kill him . The trial court sentenced private PERSON to DATE imprisonment but reduced it to DATE and DATE because it considered that private PERSON had killed PERSON in the execution of his duties as a soldier and had later regretted his actions . The trial court also concluded that there was no evidence to show that PERSON had been ill - treated , and acquitted all the defendants charged with that offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG ( \u201c the appeal court \u201d ) rejected the appeal lodged by the applicants . Like the trial court , the appeal court also considered that ORG conclusions discredited the applicants ' allegations .", "CARDINAL .
